Title: Andrew Wilson gets CONFRONTED by BIGGEST HATER
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tP7PxA4kBpo&t=79s

(0:01) okay I think this face is unmuted okay all right so I just wanted to address the host uh real quick because I think
(0:08) um we already we are already familiar uh with Wilson's particular style he's very
(0:15) combative i think you already guys have um noticed the way that he speaks over
(0:21) people before they can make their point um we also saw the thing with with
(0:26) Naddie and and the other thing is that oh uh Uncle Uncle Tom is not a a co-host
(0:32) anymore okay okay so we have we have Mart we have Marte as a co-host and I
(0:39) think that we combinate I mean with the with the combination of Wilson's
(0:45) aggressive style and the fact that he has like already two co-hosts that bouch
(0:51) Oh you're just complaining so do you want to be co-host Valerie if you're co-host can you go to raising your hand
(0:58) and being good faith and answering questions it's fine do you want to be co-host is that going to make you happy
(1:04) or what do you what do you want how do you want to stack the odds like Marte hasn't said anything all that's t taken
(1:11) place so far is you made claims against Andrew that you haven't been able to substantiate he asked you a few
(1:17) questions um and that you just did haven't answered that's literally all that's happened and and by the way
(1:24) several hundred people have seen this take place so I'm not trying to stag the odds i think
(1:31) you both know that this is a very curious state of affairs again
(1:36) combinating Wilson's style and the fact that he constantly interrupts and he doesn't let people finish and that you
(1:43) also love to mute the space and you love to talk over people so yeah I have like
(1:49) about a 45 minutes but yeah if you want to give me go host and my phone doesn't explode yeah sure so so yeah so let me
(1:57) So let me say something on this so here's what happens i don't have a combative style what happens is I don't
(2:04) let people run away when I ask them a question and they don't ask answer the question I asked them they answer a
(2:09) different question it's a form of filibustering and monologuing i asked her a question which was specific to my
(2:15) worldview about Christian ethics she refused to answer it while at the same time saying that I held an inconsistent
(2:22) standard how can you say I hold an inconsistent standard but won't ask or answer a single question about the
(2:28) standard I hold that's [ __ ] that's [ __ ] offiscation it's [ __ ] filibustering you're damn right I'm
(2:35) going to cut you off and make you answer the actual question I asked you and so in the future just do that i'll listen
(2:42) patiently to your answers but don't [ __ ] me by giving me answers to questions I didn't ask you i'm not
(2:48) interested in your monologues or your feelings i'm interested in the answers to the questions I actually asked
(2:59) uh so we got hands Terry and then uh Natty
(3:05) yeah uh it's very interesting to see like the like these women tried to call out Andrew when they were literally calling his wife a [ __ ] and then expect
(3:12) him just to sit there and just be like a little nice boy makes no sense um the the the main kind of point that like
(3:17) Nadi was saying which like is is just make no sense i'm not even Christian and I I have like four different quotes here
(3:23) from the Bible from Ephesians wives submit your own husbands as to the Lord uh uh Cleatians uh wives submit your
(3:30) husbands as is fitting to the Lord peter likewise wives be subject to your own husbands titus bring the young women uh
(3:36) to love their husbands and children be sub self-control pure working at home uh kind and submissive to her own husband
(3:42) so in multiple areas of the Bible it says for the for a woman to be submissive to her husband what I think happens is like they they see like
(3:49) Andrew Tate and they they get mixed up with the last names because like they're both called Andrew and then they instantly because like the the whole
(3:55) kind of like uh diet tribe that comes out was like oh he'd be shamed if he went down one of these podcast what one of these Red Pill podcasts where Andrew
(4:02) literally called uh Myron out for one of his prescriptions with the 50 women on
(4:07) live like right in front of his face destroyed that worldview and since now Myron has stopped using that so this
(4:12) whole thing that like Andrew is like one of these like red pillars or manosphere things it's just comical because all
(4:18) you're doing is just projecting your own own [ __ ] onto Andrew yeah I appreciate that Terry so uh from the space is
(4:25) titled net negative is Andrew a net negative so uh we got a lot of people requesting so we're not going to uh
(4:32) accept anybody who's actually feels that Andrew is a net positive it's only if
(4:38) he's a net negative you want to speak your peace we're going to settle this now uh Natty you got your hand up necro
(4:44) I don't know if you I don't think you have any criticisms of Andrew but if you want then you can go next before Before
(4:50) you bring Before you bring Natty up and I'm happy to engage with her I am going to preface this though by saying that
(4:56) Natty the reason she hates me so much she was pedalling a conspiracy theory that I was in cahoots with some [ __ ]
(5:03) guy who I don't know all right and have never even had a conversation with once and she pedled a conspiracy theory to an
(5:10) entire space i don't I don't What was this guy's name i don't even remember his name i Peter right and yeah there we
(5:18) go there we go that I was was uh in cahoots with him and that I was trying
(5:24) to pass some type and and when I asked her for the evidence of this she promised that she would provide said
(5:30) evidence and she would provide it soon to date she has never provided this evidence and all of this spuring by
(5:37) Natty is always just her trying to uh offiscate from the fact that she made
(5:43) wild [ __ ] accusations and to to this day has not backed up a single one of
(5:48) them with any form of evidence whatsoever and so my only question to Natty before you bring her up is where's
(5:54) the [ __ ] evidence Natty or will you at least publicly apologize that you made those ridiculous statements about
(6:00) me go ahead Natty [ __ ] apologize
(6:06) would you like me to answer the question now Uncle Tom and man yeah yeah you had your hand up you're you're next so go
(6:13) ahead all right no problem yeah so Andrew um I did a space with Jean Esme
(6:19) who is also an ex men's rights activist like I am and we went through the
(6:24) evidence that we have that Rachel being mentored and influenced by
(6:31) Peter Wright and that because you agree with her perspective therefore you are complicit
(6:38) i did not claim okay don't evidence do not interrupt i'm just asking what's the
(6:44) evidence for guys guys I'm not being interrupted when you made the accusation
(6:50) give us the evidence [ __ ] let me finish what I'm Yeah where's the evidence give us the [ __ ] evidence [ __ ] i There
(6:56) you go look yeah I I do like the humor so I want to keep If you have humor
(7:02) outburst you're more than welcome to but I do want to have like see where this goes so uh Natty continue
(7:12) okay again let me clarify one more time rachel Peter Wright was a Patreon of
(7:21) Rachel's and they had an extensive conversation on the Patreon which was
(7:26) public for those who are also patrons okay and then it also had inference in
(7:32) that conversation that she has been talking to him and he has gone back and forth with her and influenced her
(7:38) positioning on the worldview that the west is gyocentric and use for her book
(7:44) now at the time I said to you I'm happy to have a debate or discussion with you about this again and then I had you
(7:50) cahoot right and I got a comic to prove it [ __ ] I encountered that anyway yeah yeah necro chill bro I got to move you
(7:57) down bro sorry man anyway so I did I did a a uh space with
(8:04) Dean Esme where we went into detail about Dean's evidence regarding this okay and it's it's p it's a pinned tweet
(8:12) on my account and I even I even went back to say "Hey Andrew I'm ready to
(8:17) talk to you about this now with this evidence." And I was blocked by both him and Rachel so he is a fat liar what he's
(8:26) just said is a lie that I did not provide any evidence because when I went to go and speak to him about it I was
(8:33) blocked okay um so my perspective all right I think you landed your plane
(8:39) didn't you andrew can you respond to this she says there's evidence of some kind
(8:45) well it's on my account if he wants to listen to the interview with Dean he he can do that uh he even has screenshots
(8:52) of her talking to Pisa right yeah and why did you block me Andrew after that
(8:59) conversation you were like "Oh when you bring the evidence I'll talk to you again." But then you blocked me because
(9:04) you're a little [ __ ] so is it my turn to respond now absolutely sounds like it okay great
(9:11) yeah yeah so uh you got blocked because I tried to set up a second debate with you and you said maybe in months when I
(9:18) have the deck why are you interrupting yeah yeah sorry to mute you Andrew natty if you interrupt I got to move you down
(9:25) sorry you went on a long rant andrew's got to uh be able to defend
(9:32) natty control yourself no Andrew andrew don't [ __ ] lie she's just She just
(9:37) can't control herself no Andrew anyway Andrew don't [ __ ] lie look I'm just not allowed to not allowed to say a word
(9:45) yeah not allowed to say a word so anyway uh yeah so uh before whatever you're
(9:50) talking about happened were you blocked before or after naddie we had that conversation where you
(9:56) jumped in my space spontaneously and you were blocked after i mean you were you blocked me afterwards no no no that's
(10:03) not what I asked you i asked you before you presented the so-called evidence were you blocked before or after
(10:10) i didn't even have a chance to say to you I have the evidence because you had already blocked me okay so you were So
(10:16) you were blocked before got it so then when you just lied your [ __ ] ass off and said blocked you hang on nanny my
(10:23) turn natty natty my turn natty my turn andrew andrew natty andrew natty it's my
(10:29) turn natty you're a fundamentalist i need to be orthodox are you Why won't Why won't you let me respond i didn't
(10:37) interrupt you at all go ahead you can come You can come back up request night
(10:42) maddie if you can behave so here's the very first lie the very first lie is that and you heard her all claim it that
(10:49) she had a bunch of evidence and it was because she had a bunch of this so-called evidence that I blocked her
(10:55) come to find out of course she was blocked long before that and it was based on the fact that I wanted to follow up the date and she wouldn't give
(11:02) it to me cuz I was continuing to ask her for this evidence now as I scroll through you ready for her massive
(11:09) [ __ ] truth bomb of evidence she had a conversation once with this guy
(11:15) publicly my god that means that she must be a disciple and they got her entire
(11:21) view of gyocentrism from whoever said guy is right whatever that means these
(11:27) people are [ __ ] nut cases she just got caught in a lie it was an easy lie to catch her in and by the way this
(11:34) so-called evidence that she has is oh one time on a Patreon publicly they
(11:40) talked and did did you guys see the conversation they had it was like it
(11:45) wasn't even long like these people are conspiracy theorists tinfoil hatwearing lunatics
(11:51) and her entire vendetta an agenda against me a baptized Orthodox Christian
(11:56) in good standing with the church by the way Natty um is just what is just that
(12:03) well you know I really don't like this guy Peter right and I don't like any of
(12:08) his views and I tried to tie Andrew and Rachel in with his views and couldn't provide any evidence of this supposed
(12:15) disciplehip nor mentorship which is what our accusations were he mentored us and we were his disciples those were her
(12:22) actual accusations not that Rachel one time on a Patreon might have had a back and forth with this guy and who the [ __ ]
(12:28) knows if she even knew who the guy was how would we even know that you know how many random [ __ ] people contact us
(12:34) from the Redfield community i have no [ __ ] clue who these people are so these again just lie after lie after lie
(12:41) from this [ __ ] most of you [ __ ] honestly most of my critics most of you
(12:47) just [ __ ] lie like you don't even know what uh what the context for 90% of the things I say are and even when
(12:54) you're corrected you still lie like you can get I can give you demonstrable evidence of your falsehoods
(13:01) and you will still [ __ ] lie because once you guys get bogged down and you get embedded in a position
(13:08) you feel like backing off of it is going to make you lose face when the opposite is true you could just be like "Fuck I
(13:14) didn't know that i'm sorry man." And that would be the end of it you think that I'm the one who's
(13:21) prideful and an egoomaniac like imagine having tens of thousands of people who lie about you every
(13:28) day like yeah I'm sure that that would be enough to irritate anybody so uh so
(13:35) Natty can you go into why you think he's uh a net negative you you got you got
(13:41) the mic again i'm going to have to rotate some speakers we got a lot of people requesting uh if you have this is
(13:47) only why you think Andrew is net negative for society uh so that's it so
(13:53) I would like I would like to respond to everything that came that what he just said for quickly no no no we're not
(14:00) doing he said she said it's enough you made your argument the audience can decide for themselves andrew responded
(14:07) that's it how about just agree to like he's debating you now so if you want
(14:13) that debate you were asking for or whatever it was then yeah absolutely why is he So why is he a net negative why is
(14:20) he a net negative okay well he's a net negative because
(14:26) him and his wife are promoting a conspiracy theory by the way that the West is gyocentric which is based on an
(14:34) anti-Christian worldview is subversive in nature is historically inaccurate and
(14:40) it's by a guy called Peter Wright who acts in a Mavavelian manner and goes around behind the scenes talking to
(14:46) people who come out uh responding to the Manosphere Red Pill Culture War talking
(14:51) points um he's done this with Pearl Davies he's done this with others like
(14:57) that and then when they don't actually promote things that he likes he gets his troll army to try and misrepresent them
(15:03) and I have evidence for that which I could go into another time the fact that Andrew Wilson and Rachel Wilson don't
(15:09) even realize that they're pedalling something um that is a particularly subversive worldview and he doesn't even
(15:17) get that yeah maybe this man did not have much interference in their personal
(15:22) lives but uh he has had interaction or at least his wife has had significant
(15:28) interaction with him in fact she does know who he is because when she was talking to him about this he made it
(15:34) very clear that he is the author of this perspective okay now this perspective
(15:40) that the west is women- centered at the expense of men is based on a view that
(15:45) culturally speaking um in in the past women were expected to be like the
(15:52) Virgin Mary and the Virgin Mary was placed on a pedestal above others because she was viewed as sinless and
(15:57) she was also used as some kind of standin when during feudalism um when feudalism became about respecting women
(16:04) instead of being code of conduct of behavior um and he tries to claim that this was some kind of conspiracy
(16:12) ben I'm making the point thank you you didn't give me a time limit so do you want to give me a time limit now no no
(16:19) just I'm going to finish i'm going to land it now thank you okay so and then
(16:24) he says right that um men were expected to be Christlike and this was this made
(16:30) them become simp and we've had that was what the background was in uh going up back to
(16:37) the medieval period and then when we had egitarianism and feminism came along and
(16:42) tried to make sure that women still had the privileges they had from the past and it was not fair to expect men to be
(16:48) Christlike this is theologically inaccurate and I I actually had my priest read over um Peter Wright's works
(16:56) and his essays and he wrote me an essay in response but completely calling out the nonsense that it is i also have a
(17:03) spiritual adviser who is a nun who used to be uh in a monastery in Cree who's very senior in the UK and has an
(17:10) influence in her church and teaches at seminary who also understood exactly
(17:16) what I was talking about when I went over this with her so if we're talking about who has the blessing to talk on
(17:22) the internet about these things um I would say I'm also in that category um
(17:27) so Andrew is a net negative because if he is receiving guidance from Father
(17:33) Trenum his views regarding gender which I've examined myself are more from the
(17:39) lens of a Protestant fundamentalist perspective which takes scripture out of
(17:44) context so it takes a lot some of the scripture that Tar um mentioned earlier
(17:50) uh there's loads of stuff in there like I have never said anything against submitting to your husband in the Lord
(17:58) right but when you actually put that in line with everything else and the whole of the church of what the church teaches
(18:04) okay then it also says husbands love your wives like Christ loved the church well what did Christ do for the church
(18:10) he died for the church adam's will okay um he will he ate the fruit willfully
(18:18) and his will is what needs healing first in man so he's leading by redemption the
(18:23) one the woman being under him which the Protestant fundamentalists like to go on
(18:28) and on about is a consequence of the fall it's not something to do with the
(18:34) fact that oh he was some kind of superior being they are they have an
(18:39) equal nature and when they're in Christ they're supposed to be in Christ and be Christlike their natures are fulfilled
(18:46) in that way right and I could go into an Orthodox theologian's teaching about uh
(18:52) how the genders should be which I won't go on about now because I'm trying to land a plane okay but that it's not you
(18:59) do get there's different gyocentric theories right uh no there isn't actually so that's my argument okay okay
(19:07) so this conversation has gone to [ __ ] mode again
(19:14) all right Andrew do you want to respond
(19:20) double mute double mute lied about the fact that um about the blocking thing oh
(19:25) Jesus andrew uh it's your turn bro
(19:31) yeah so anyway it's so so I'm not Yeah so she she'll just fill a buster forever
(19:37) uh so it sounds like she should name a space why Peter Wright is bad for society because all of her ranting and
(19:43) raving seem to have to do with this guy and very little of it to do with me so how she seems to want to
(19:51) like you I don't know I don't know why you're still talking i didn't interrupt you at all we're allowed to say I didn't
(19:58) interrupt you at all go stuff your face with something for a minute while I talk go stuff your face for a minute while I
(20:04) talk maddie calm down calm down Maddie tom said we're allowed out so you know
(20:10) okay can you stop talking your whole criticism is Andrew interrupts andrew interrupts and then I can't get two
(20:17) words in without you interrupting
(20:22) i literally I literally patiently listen to everything you had to say but you won't do me the same
(20:30) service yeah okay so anyway um that's what the space should be called she should call it why I think
(20:36) Peter Wright is bad for society um which is fine i don't know this guy from Adam
(20:42) and I don't give a [ __ ] about him doesn't mean anything to me i have no idea who this guy is i don't think I've ever talked to him uh or if I have I
(20:50) didn't know I was talking to him so the thing is Oh my god shut the [ __ ] [ __ ] shut up
(20:58) don't be a joke oh Natty come on that's your last warning andrew's got I'm sorry
(21:06) i'm sorry i apologize Uncle Tom i quiet now
(21:11) sorry Andrew go ahead maybe you're double muted Andrew go
(21:18) ahead andrew doesn't know who his wife talks
(21:23) to by the way andrew why is
(21:29) wife that's supposed to be a There's a human it's not look it's fine
(21:35) it's Listen listen it's fine if I'm not allowed to speak in the space I'm not allowed to speak in the space no no definitely go there's nothing I can do
(21:41) about that no I can say I'm sorry i'm sorry
(21:49) whatever yeah yeah yeah i don't I don't I don't I don't know why uh you say you hold this standard to me that you won't
(21:55) apply to yourself i don't get that so anyway um the whole this whole
(22:02) thing was an attempt by the way to filibuster my thought process but I'll just go right back into it so that's what the space should have been named
(22:09) why I hate Peter Wright is what she actually meant for this to be or whatever this whoever this [ __ ] guy
(22:14) is she goes on and on and on about how he ties in something to negative theology
(22:21) which is fine maybe he does i have no [ __ ] clue and I don't give a [ __ ] cuz he's not me has nothing to do with me
(22:28) has never had anything to do with me my views on ontology the nature of men and women have been public for a long long
(22:35) long time and I'm sure that they have long before any such message between
(22:40) Peter Wright and Rachel happened on some [ __ ] public uh Patreon page right so
(22:47) the thing is is like all of this is guilt by association this is just Natty
(22:52) trying to create guilt by association this guy holds these views these views are wrong and unorthodox therefore
(22:57) Andrew must hold these views of which are unorthodox but she hasn't shown me where I hold these views i've told her
(23:05) before when I say ginoentric she's using a word concept fallacy i have a
(23:10) different case used for this word she just says that that's not possible she's just like "Nope it's not possible."
(23:16) Anytime you say anything about the word gyocentrism which to me just means that you're holding uh men to an unfair
(23:22) standard in comparison to women right by focusing on the weaknesses of women and
(23:27) the strengths of men rather than in the reverse that there's also weaknesses of men and strengths to women so this is
(23:34) the the parallel in society and yeah I do rage about that quite a bit but that has nothing to do with what her idea
(23:41) here is of gyocentrism where it's tied into a theological lens uh based on
(23:46) Protestant nonsense she also makes the the uh crazy ass case here that uh if
(23:52) you're being spiritually guided by you know this priest I have one spiritual father Daddy one and it's not any of the
(23:59) people that you mention and I don't even think I've talked to any of the people you've mentioned so I don't know why you
(24:06) think that I'm gleaning my views from these people it's because you hate this guy and you want me to be him or in some
(24:13) way tied in with him your evidence is god is dog [ __ ] god awful
(24:18) nonsense and you haven't actually been able to tie how I hold the same view that this guy holds even if it were the
(24:25) case let's just say hypothetically that I talk to this guy every single day and he's like my bestest buddy in the world
(24:32) even if that were the case you would still have to show how my views align with his views that's what you would
(24:39) have to show and I would want the demonstration of that so go ahead and do that do that part of
(24:47) it so Matt it sounds like he engaged you directly so you can go ahead by the way
(24:53) just to reset the space I got uh the nest here it says Andrew's net
(24:58) negative go ahead and uh comment in there if you think he's a net negative
(25:03) that way I can know to give you a mic anyone who thinks he's a net negative you I'll give you a mic uh Natty go
(25:10) ahead and respond yeah no problem um okay so the reason
(25:16) why I say it's not possible for you to have a different definition regarding
(25:22) the gyneism worldview is because what you said your definition of gyocentrism
(25:27) is pretty much falls under what Peter Wright's um extended definition is and
(25:32) he's the one who popularized the term in the first place in fact the only reason that you know about the term is because
(25:38) Peter Wright did the work to promote it and the manosphere and the red pill and the entire culture war on the right-wing
(25:45) side knows about it because of this man okay um I don't even think you understand it's a little bit how you'll
(25:52) hear Carl Marx theories used in different um different uh places right
(25:58) marxism for example is a very similar thing there and then you also have the same thing in regards to say patriarchy
(26:04) theory from feminist theory okay very interesting thing that happens is
(26:09) feminist is feminist calling a woman a feminist now is a porative right now if
(26:14) I talk about the definition of patriarchy being the rule of men or the
(26:20) rule of fathers okay and I don't talk about it as a um kind of from a more um
(26:26) Marxist or traditionally feminist analysis of power dynamics yeah um and then I will say
(26:34) well actually there is a basic definition of that and then they extended the definition right um and
(26:41) there are other people go "Well you're still a feminist anyway because you don't." And I'm like "Okay all right now
(26:48) I know that you're [ __ ] and that you don't understand that people that some people may have changed the definition
(26:53) of a word which is quite often used when you're trying to subvert or propagandize." Now when it comes to
(27:00) gyocentrism however the only person that popularized that term in the current context that
(27:06) we're in was Peter Wright he took the term at this most basic right and
(27:11) expanded it and this claim that the west is going to Nat you realize 350 people
(27:17) are in the space to listen to Andrew right he's bringing all the numbers in not you so can you let him speak please we're here to listen to him my love
(27:25) all right Natty we keep having to put you to listener um so I might have to do that again uh it's Yeah and Andrew I
(27:32) think you'll like this comment that we got uh somebody should make a space about Natty being a net negative so I
(27:39) think you'd find that pretty funny i'll do that space in 30 minutes so here let
(27:44) me uh Matty shut up n let me let me respond to this gyocentrism
(27:51) has been used since 1897 just FYI the word gyocentrism uh yeah so so
(27:57) anyway um most of most of what Rachel's writing about would come from these older terms of courtly love which
(28:04) scholars have been investigating since the 1800s so I don't know what the [ __ ] uh Nattie is even talking about she's
(28:09) once again trying to draw uh some kind of loose conclusion because she's obsessed with this guy [ __ ] Peter
(28:15) Wright has nothing again did you notice how she didn't actually attack any of my views she spent all of her time
(28:22) attacking Peter Wright's views not my views not Andrew Wilson's views but Peter Wright's views she doesn't say
(28:28) "Andrew says this and this is what I disagree with." If she did that I would have something to respond to but instead
(28:35) she just consistently says "This other guy over here has this set of beliefs that I disagree with." And then
(28:41) therefore Andrew also has this set of beliefs which I disagree with even though I'm actually here to defend my
(28:46) beliefs directly so that's what's insane to me right not only that um she also
(28:52) draws even more insane conclusions notice that she she tried to draw parallels with like there being
(28:58) spiritual fathers who we don't have right who somehow are involved with us as well all of these things which if she
(29:05) just asked I would just tell her you know that's the funniest part right you could just ask me and I would just
(29:10) [ __ ] tell you like if this guy was awesome and I knew who the [ __ ] he was and I loved his stuff and I thought it
(29:16) was great i would literally just tell you that [ __ ] I'd be like "This guy's great i completely agree with him here's
(29:22) the defense of what he's saying the reason I'm not doing any of that is cuz I don't [ __ ] know anything about him
(29:27) i don't know the guy i've never known the guy." Right his and when and she
(29:32) also she makes the most bizarre claim which is that you can't have a proprietary definition to a madeup
(29:37) [ __ ] ass word like gyocentrism why can't you have a proprietary definition for these words all I would ever need to
(29:44) do is show that I ever used this word before I ever could have met this guy and I guarant [ __ ] to you I probably
(29:49) have uh to disprove this entire [ __ ] thing the whole thing would be debunked and it's like again so Andrew can't use
(29:57) prop have a proprietary definition of a completely madeup [ __ ] term like gyocentrism that's one two she's still
(30:02) raging about some other guy's [ __ ] worldview and not my own which is two and three she keeps trying to tie me in
(30:10) as though somehow this guy who she's never demonstrated I've had any contact with let alone uh have have was a
(30:18) disciple of influenced my worldview at all has nothing at all to do with that
(30:23) now they would actually be easier for her to show the demonstration that I align with the worldview by attacking
(30:30) the portions of my world view that she believes that I hold and then we could
(30:35) get to the bottom of it that way but she doesn't do that she just continuously goes on about Peter Wright and it's like
(30:41) I don't care about [ __ ] P i don't care about this guy Natty i don't give a [ __ ] about him what do you have to say
(30:47) to me about my worldview not Peter i don't want to hear another word about Peter right tell me what Andrew Wilson
(30:54) is saying that's wrong all right Blend I see you're requesting
(30:59) you think uh Andrew's a negative so Blend I'll bring you up so in the nest
(31:05) just comment in there if you think Andrew's a net negative request the mic i bring you up valerie um you came back
(31:12) uh you rage quit earlier you're back now so do you want to uh engage with Andrew
(31:18) um I didn't rage quit i disconnected accidentally and the host will tell told
(31:24) me that I will get co-host because I don't want to be interrupted because I
(31:29) have not been able to make a single point so thank you
(31:35) yeah yeah yeah sure uh I'll actually let you take my spot right so then we can
(31:41) stop the whining uh you just have to uh the only rule is you'll just be dropped
(31:47) if you talk over Andrew so that's the only rule so go ahead remove me from
(31:52) co-host and uh Valerie you
(32:11) Okay I think I you have a lot of background noise on your mic [ __ ] sorry
(32:17) I can't unmute oh god damn it
(32:23) no I can't unmute and if you're telling me there's a lot of background noise it's not your
(32:29) It's not your mic it's not your mic anyways I'm glad that we don't have to hear that anymore all right who are we
(32:35) moving on to next
(32:43) i just have a very quick thing to say because I I do kind of have to go but I will say something that I promise is in
(32:51) good faith because it's it's a critique that I have of Wilson's model and why I don't think it's the best approach i
(32:58) don't think Andrew promotes a climate an atmosphere in his quote unquote debates
(33:04) where there's um a lot of space for people to reconsider stuff for people to
(33:10) have a meeting of the minds there's no space for people to back off and reconsider their claims it's a very you
(33:17) you guys use this expression all the time the blood sports thing and it doesn't sorry in my view in my
(33:25) experience it doesn't allow this is not the way that ideas move this is just a quick cheap ego shot that people see
(33:33) because they want to have um um like a various victory through Andrew with the
(33:40) audience this a very specific psychological um effect and it responds to a very specific model and the the
(33:47) thing is is that I understand that Andrew is a dancing monkey he wants to put in a show he wants to perform he has
(33:54) to sell a show he wants the clicks he wants the attention he wants the engagement and sadly tolerant and
(34:02) intellectual conversations is not what gets the that engagement it's the it's the what did the other one say and and I
(34:09) understand that this is Andrew's model but the reason that I say that it's not
(34:14) the most beneficial thing is that I have seen lots of people who are very very well-versed in their in their uh chosen
(34:22) fields these are people that have several books under their belts they go in panels or with open mics where people
(34:29) can um give them all kinds of critique and push back but yet a lot of these people they they they go on live streams
(34:36) they go on podcasts yet none of these intellectuals want to have anything to
(34:41) do with Andrew the only people who want to interact with Andrew is like this very bottom of the barrel dumb internet
(34:50) only have fan [ __ ] who are not going to have a much of a chance with him and that I think that says a lot and this is
(34:57) one of the reasons that I do say that it's not the most um optimistic approach
(35:02) i'm not saying you cannot do this like we all know that this is done on the internet we see it all the time it gets
(35:07) a lot of it gets a lot of money and it gets a lot of attention but the problem is is that I think um these kind of
(35:15) efforts will be better spent in stuff like mentoringship and stuff like putting your words where your putting
(35:22) your actions where your words are because all of this stuff with dunking on degeneracy i don't think you're going
(35:28) to do a lot of that on the internet because people again people are not reconsidering ideas they just want again
(35:35) this vicarious victory through Andrew with the audience because they feel like
(35:40) they're dunking ideas you're repeating yourself now you're repeating yourself i'm done okay I'm done thank you why is
(35:46) it that no intellectual would entertain you well Valerie to be fair like
(35:51) literally u Andrew could barely get a word in this entire space right like he is trying to debate fairly but he can't
(35:57) talk no well this is the first time that I'm able to make my point so that Thank
(36:02) you for that and I didn't I didn't interrupt you i didn't interrupt you until you started to loop this is the only time the only time congratulations
(36:11) well hey look if you treat me with respect they treat you with respect that's how that works so let me explain
(36:17) this so that like you just contradicted yourselves multiple times the for on the
(36:22) one hand you say look uh this this effort would be much better spent with
(36:28) in academia and with intellectualism and with these boring ass podcast and then you admitted the second side I didn't
(36:34) say that I didn't say that they were misconstruing my words I'm sorry I didn't interrupt you once
(36:41) you see what I mean you people you can't hold to the very same standard you apply to me you can't even hold to your own
(36:47) Hey
(36:55) who muted him guys it wasn't me
(37:00) so she can't Yeah she can't so once again she can't hold to the very
(37:05) standards that she holds me to right don't interrupt don't interrupt don't interrupt didn't interrupt her at all
(37:11) she immediately interrupts me right hey Marte you got to mute marte you got to mute your mic because there's background
(37:16) noise yeah mute your mic bro so anyway uh she can't even hold to the standard she applies to me you know you got to
(37:23) mute got to don't interrupt don't interrupt don't interrupt immediately interrupts me so anyhow uh and then they
(37:28) wonder they're like "This is Blood Sports." It's like "Yeah you haven't even seen Blood Sports give me a break." Um so here's here's the contradiction
(37:35) the first contradiction she says "Well nobody's watching these other people right andrew is an entertainer and it
(37:40) brings in lots of clicks and this and that." Well how else do you get good ideas out there except to get people to view them people actually have to view
(37:48) them and the thing that allows people in the entertainment age to view ideas is
(37:53) well they have to be entertaining if you want to look at the most successful people who push ideas like let's say
(37:59) Donald Trump for instance they're extremely entertaining while they do it now don't pretend that that's not
(38:06) effective because it is effective i'm best served exactly where I think I'm best served which is in an entertainment
(38:12) position to push good ideas that's one the second she goes back and she knows she's lying about this and they always
(38:18) know they're lying about this andrew only debates with only fans thoughts it's like okay all you have to do is go
(38:25) and look at my 1v one debates which I have done with intellectuals all over
(38:30) the world many of whom are extremely popular guys like Matt Dillah Hunty for instance many many people who I've
(38:37) engaged with i've debated way more men than I have women who are supposedly
(38:43) they supposedly have these extremely high academic credentials but most of the women that I debate with also have
(38:50) way higher academic credentials than I do usually they have degrees in psychology sociology or they have
(38:56) degrees in uh science one of the sciences or they have degrees in other things usually these people have a way
(39:03) higher standard into these [ __ ] spaces to begin with with these massive followings where people do give them way
(39:09) more credit than they should have cuz nobody will engage with them so it's like massive massive and when she
(39:16) pretends to none of the a great intellectuals will engage with Andrew yeah like [ __ ] who like who you tell
(39:23) me cuz I turn them down constantly usually because I'm too busy i got other things going on or whatever but my
(39:30) lineup of people who want to debate is [ __ ] endless so you just lie you lie through your teeth because you don't
(39:36) know what the hell you're talking about so you know I'd like you to actually respond to that stuff well you know like
(39:42) prostitutes uh Jesus liked prostitutes right and you're a big fan of Jesus so I mean there's kind of a parallel there uh
(39:48) you being like this this rebranded blend blend blend he's talking to Valerie but you'll get your turn Blend
(39:57) yeah i think it's very telling that you said several academics and you could only name one like for example you do
(40:03) this thing where you dunk on quote unquote feminists all the time but I have never seen you talk to a true
(40:09) feminist someone someone that has written books somebody who is involved in law making I don't know somebody like
(40:16) Helen Joyce somebody like Karedansky hell even like uh Mara Forstat or um
(40:23) Caitlyn Stark like I don't think you can hold your way through all these with all these people i think the reason that you
(40:28) stay with the Instagram thoughts it's it's there's a reason for that is that anybody who knows who has a good grasp
(40:34) on history and philosophy knows that you don't have a much more of a academic
(40:40) background of any kind and your wife doesn't either she wrote a book yes but it's a it's a I had to say it's it's a
(40:47) yeah I I struggle to to call it a book again you you do vual virtual signaling
(40:54) a lot and you do this you know oh I talked to all of these intellectuals but it's not like again you could only name
(41:01) one you don't have a lot of people who have like their own research or who have written their own
(41:07) books or people who have like very longstanding careers or a lot of credentials because I don't I don't
(41:14) think that's your league honestly i think again you said it yourself you're an entertainer you're not an
(41:20) intellectual so I think yeah you should stay with the with the Instagram thoughts and the only fans horse that's
(41:27) your debate everyone it's just the content that goes viral is with him with like only
(41:33) that's the point that it goes viral yeah yeah so because serious can serious
(41:39) research and and intellectual conversations get responded consumers and algorithms
(41:46) fault not Andrews yeah am I allowed to respond to any of this right so first of all you said no
(41:53) intellectuals i just named one off the top of my head but a lot of the 1v1 debates I've done with feminists on the
(41:58) whatever podcast they have written books and have published research you don't know what you're talking about also the
(42:03) same thing with the men that I've debated many of them are authors and many of them are researchers i can get you a compiled list of how many of them
(42:10) have written books or how many of them have published research but everybody from JF Gary uh who was a neuroscientist
(42:16) to many other men that I've debated have in fact at some points were extremely
(42:21) well regarded uh authors in side of fields and subjects like this so again
(42:27) you just don't know what you're talking about and it's not just that but here's the thing if you want to point me to one
(42:33) of these people who you think is an advanced feminist who and she wants to do an Oxford style debate that would be
(42:39) fine too myself or my wife would be happy to do that if they're concerned that there's going to be too much blood
(42:46) sports i excel in those as well and I'm not afraid of any of these [ __ ] people so why don't you tell me who
(42:53) these feminists are who are so great who would just blow me out of the water and I'll set up a debate with them right now
(42:59) what are their names um for example there's Caitlyn Stark she wrote a book
(43:04) called Material Girls there's um Helen Joyce she wrote a book about the whole
(43:11) gender thing it's called Trans okay there's also then contact them and tell
(43:17) them that I want to do an Oxford style debate with them i will tell them i I mean I I have I have talked to Garanski
(43:24) in the past but here's the thing i mean I I think I think they are also familiar
(43:30) with your model and it's not that I want to tone police you Andrew calm down but
(43:36) you have to also recognize that you have a certain style okay style
(43:41) debate style debate but do you see do you see what you're doing but do you see what you're
(43:48) doing thing we're not on YouTube we're not on YouTube calm down can you just can you just tell me what can you just
(43:54) tell me what an awkward But do you see what you do you see what's going on i'm trying to Valerie
(44:01) valerie valerie valerie valerie answer Andrew's question please can you do that in good faith i was
(44:08) giving him names i was not done giving him names i can give more names but the thing is is that I think they're also
(44:15) familiar with his with his style of doing things this is not tone poisoning but again I I I don't think you have
(44:22) earned yourself the fame to I I don't want to be offensive to to be honest but
(44:28) I don't think you have like the reputation to go and ask like good faith debates from these people you have made
(44:36) a face all over the internet i think you have to also take accountability when it
(44:42) comes to this that you have given yourself a certain fame and then because of that there's a a certain people who
(44:47) are way more regarded when it comes to this that are not going to engage with you and that has to do with you because
(44:53) I did bring up I did point out this point to Marte yesterday that and I said
(44:59) why is it that all these people will not engage with him and his answer was that oh just everybody else is the problem is
(45:07) because Andrew is going to expose them and they don't want that it's like it's almost as if Andrew is the only person
(45:13) in the internet who gives uh push back and who gives critique like these people engage with a wide variety of other
(45:21) minds and yet they will not just Valerie I'm going to close are you just
(45:28) going to filibuster he asked I'm going to close with this i think this is this is just a moment of I think this should
(45:35) be a moment of self-reflection for for Andrew and his team and to maybe I don't
(45:40) know if this is giving good results i I guess at some point Andrew has to speak
(45:46) at some point you have to let him speak they don't do that they don't they just
(45:51) filibuster but think about how unfalsifiable this position is she contradicted herself again that's all
(45:57) they ever do is contradict themselves she says,"Wh won't these academics debate with you you don't have enough
(46:02) credibility for these academics to debate with you." It's like "Wait a second what?" So on the one hand she
(46:08) says "You're too afraid to debate with these people." And then on the directly on the other hand she says "No these
(46:14) people just don't think you have the credibility to debate with them." Then she says "Well no you're uh you're not
(46:20) really a net negative you should just stay in the entertainment zone." So like she just contradicts her hey hey my turn
(46:26) my turn my turn same thing my turn same thing when I said what I said Andrew you're
(46:34) doing that thing it is what you said it is what you said you're lying through your teeth we all
(46:40) say I didn't say that you were afraid of engaging with these people i know that you're perfectly willing to send the
(46:48) invitation i am saying that they don't want to entertain you because of you
(46:53) have a certain thing got it likewise got it well how convenient how convenient
(46:58) Valerie that they can avoid a debate with one of the um most super chatted
(47:04) YouTubers dancing monkey Andrew don't don't paint yourself like this grandio
(47:10) image of yourself you're an entertainer you said it yourself yeah so stop true
(47:16) true stop trying to give you all these airs of superiority you don't have Who do you
(47:21) think has you don't have any written books you don't have any background any academic background you don't have any
(47:27) of your own research these people do and they will not entertain you yeah can I ask you a question and you have to
(47:32) address that can I ask you a question you have to address that are you going to deflect the way that you do you did
(47:38) this in the last stage oh my god you got to fill her again because I'm not
(47:44) impressed by your tricks i'm not impressed by your tricks you did it the last filibustering so so Andrew
(47:50) filibuster he also has complex you see how you contradict yourself again Valerie yes exactly contradict yourself
(47:57) constantly but not only that like look here's the thing it's so funny entertainers have way more [ __ ] clout
(48:03) in society than academics do lady who do you think moves trends who do you think stop talking stop talking
(48:11) who do you think moves [ __ ] trends right none of those names that you [ __ ] just cited none of those names
(48:17) nobody in this space knows who these people are making laws they're making laws you're not going to be around in 10
(48:23) years and you're going to be the next law you're not going to be an Orthodox bro in 10 the next 10
(48:31) years okay whatever you say you're not I know I know you're never going to let me
(48:36) finish a [ __ ] thought but anyway so it's the movers the movers and shakers are entertainment i don't know what the
(48:41) [ __ ] you're talking about even newscasters are entertainment tucker Carlson's an entertainer first but I got
(48:47) to tell you something he has moved the political dial in conversation so have many other entertainers you're [ __ ]
(48:52) coping you're saying a bunch of names people have never even [ __ ] heard of make a claim they're authors now they're
(48:58) lawmakers you're full of [ __ ] [ __ ] you know what you're full of [ __ ] you're doing the same thing that your fanboy was doing yesterday where he was citing
(49:05) a bunch of TB tropes as if they had any like widespread knowing and well
(49:11) doumented like social influence this is not what moves social trends Andrew this
(49:17) is not what moves voting this is not anything that has any type of real
(49:22) effect on society you're just coping why did you get Yeah then explain Donald
(49:28) Thex explain Donald Trump hey explain Donald Trump go ahead donald Trump had
(49:33) nothing to do with the internet you got You are one I know you're one of the guys that thinks that 4chan elected
(49:41) Trump you think that forcham elected Trump and here to tell you there's not a
(49:46) lot of people that know what is Donald Trump got to the power because he was he
(49:55) was the personality that he was but 4chan didn't have anything to do with that and I don't think I didn't say
(50:01) 4chan did I didn't say because he was all over all over the news
(50:07) cycle all over the internet you almost said it almost no it's not all over the
(50:13) internet it's in the news cycle 24/7 and the media also does that thing this is
(50:20) very different from naming TV tropes this is very different from naming
(50:25) internet celebrities we're talking about two very different things and you're doing that thing again so no but anyway
(50:32) show me your show me your academic who's ever moved the needle show me the academic that moved the social needle
(50:37) valerie go ahead i don't think academics need to mo move the needle i think academics are pointing out the social
(50:45) trends that are very well documented and that they will exist whether those academics are there to point them out or
(50:52) not thank you oh perfect so then so then the academics themselves aren't pushing
(50:57) the social trends no [ __ ] Valerie i never thought of that there's certain demographic and social trends that are
(51:03) going to exist whether Yeah they're going to behave like constants yeah
(51:10) there's a lot of stuff that you can see all through history that behaves like a constant yeah
(51:15) listen guys that's what we're pushing back i'm
(51:22) glad that you have the feminism comes from academia none i made I made my point i said what
(51:29) I had to say i did my I gave my criticisms and I said that I I did say in the group chat that I have a public
(51:36) half an hour so I kind of have to go yeah go ahead go do your go do your public whatever but anyway so yeah this
(51:42) is yet another contradiction by her she says "No no no." She starts by saying "Show me all the academic research this
(51:47) and that it's not entertainers who move the [ __ ] social post." Then she says "Ah no academics don't actually move the
(51:53) social needle they just investigate and report on it." It's like well that's [ __ ] great Valerie thanks super
(51:59) helpful true Andrew we're trying to battle against feminism is a battle against Academia go ahead no no yeah I'm
(52:06) I was just going to say you're up all right Blend you're up go ahead start from wherever you want to start from
(52:13) well I disagree let me just go on that
(52:20) oh [ __ ] double mute buddy go ahead j's off don't say J off okay so point being is I think academia is what got us in
(52:26) this position where we have this masculinity versus uh feminine uh you know a lot of infiltration through
(52:32) academia um and psychology is why we're in this position influencing courts and
(52:38) that such but what we need is uh why Andrew was in that negative is because we need actually righteous masculinity
(52:44) uh to beat this not this feminine uh cat-like nature you hear him arguing i would never argue with that woman more
(52:49) than two minutes i knew who she was cuz I wouldn't go on and on about Donald Trump with that woman and that's the issue you see with Myron Gaines you see
(52:55) with these so-called uh you know manisphere I'll use the term kind of loosely cuz I don't think he's a grifter
(53:01) but the man's talking about super chats and entertainment like who really gives a [ __ ] that's not true masculinity the guy can't open a pickle jar and I think
(53:07) that's really a net negative on society when you have Andrew well let's face it what you are is you are someone that
(53:12) believes in a sky fairy uh and you've rebranded uh this Christian youth pastor so years ago you would have just had a
(53:18) guitar talking about "Hey dude man you like that new Nirvana album hey come to church." But what you're doing now is
(53:24) you're offering uh this bait and switch of masculinity to push your Christian uh theology nonsense which will you will
(53:31) never debate with anybody like you will debate uh you know like she said these entertainers but you won't debate
(53:36) anybody serious and bring up your little sky fairy nonsense so you want to trip people up on little semantical debates
(53:42) but Mr macro point your whole world view whole worldview that you're pushing is based on this facious uh cucked religion
(53:49) of Christianity which is the opposite of masculinity so my problem with Andrew is uh just this cosplaying of masculinity
(53:56) and this need for masculinity which does come um look IVF Pro you're another guy right you have you might like my
(54:02) testosterone comes from my balls I'm 6'2 uh so these bodybuilders are also this
(54:07) this same same thing like you could open up the pickle jar but you need testosterone uh from a synthetic needle to open up uh that pickle jar I don't so
(54:15) men like me we can't stand guys uh that have to inject steroids in their ass or this guy pretend like he's some
(54:21) masculinity uh you know he's going to fight back for the man while he's meanwhile he's arguing in these little semantical debates uh with you know only
(54:29) fans model so I just don't think it's righteous I think we need righteous masculinity I think it's a disservice to see the gains and people like Andrew
(54:36) that are just these catty men uh going on and you know arguing uh with
(54:41) feminists and they actually look like feminine men to me uh so that's where I'll
(54:50) Hold on i'm going to go ahead and address this real quick because you did mention me um it's pretty obvious so you
(54:57) went ahead and talked about arguing and not lasting too long well you did the same thing you going ahead and going on
(55:04) this long rant monologue and using ad hominemum attacks and everything else she did while saying that I'm not going
(55:11) to go ahead and do this and I'm going to argue for the opposite when you're demonstrating exactly what you're railing against this makes no sense so I
(55:19) mean you're not the arbiter of masculinity here when you're portraying the same thing that you're railing against this makes no sense so I mean
(55:26) I'm going to go ahead and let Andrew defend his point the thing is it's not righteous we
(55:31) need righteous masculinity masculinity doesn't come from a needle it doesn't come from the Bible that's my point hold
(55:36) on hold on hold on i'm not attacking you with anything else as far as like you personally or anything like that you're
(55:43) unable to attack an argument and that's masculine if you can go ahead and attack my worldview and my ideology and
(55:49) feelings towards masculinity and identify what my worldview of masculinity is that would be masculine
(55:55) but you attacking needles and doing all this other stuff that's very feminine your chest and [ __ ] posing for other
(56:01) men oiled up that's what I'm just assuming sorry if I'm making a presumption you're just a strong man in the argument i'm sorry if you're calling
(56:07) people who are the arbiters of bodybuilding i.e arnold Schwarzenegger the governor of California and did all
(56:12) these other things came from Austria promoted all these other things that people don't normally do and excelled at
(56:18) the 2% of something that's very masculine the Terminator actor everything else extraordinary if you're
(56:23) calling him not masculine that's facious on stage it's not he's not masculine if you have to put a needle in your [ __ ]
(56:29) ass and shave your chest to be around other men that is the opposite of masculine men are building things henry
(56:34) Ford the brick layer out there that built the [ __ ] house not this guy shaving his chest and shaving his ass or
(56:39) arguing on the internet with women so that's the problem I have so hold on he's cosplaying in an office wait hold
(56:45) on i'm going to be No this is you and me right now this is you and me where did you see me shave my chest did I ever say
(56:51) this did you ever see me do any of this stuff see I can't even see i can see the oil off your forehead just in a space
(56:57) call dude like I'm not attacking you i'm trying to But that's your sweat i've never once so hold on let me tell you
(57:03) something if you want to know something you can ask me specifically i've not once shaved my chest or back i don't
(57:09) grow hair africanamean individuals don't grow hair on chest and back i'm sure Uncle Tom can go ahead and agree with me
(57:16) on this that doesn't happen it's very rare actually for us to grow chest hair
(57:21) and back hair so that's facious on its face matter of fact I will admit that nobody in the league is natural i'll
(57:28) admit that but before pro I turned pro I won the California uh the whole overall
(57:33) naturally as a bantamweight which has never been [ __ ] done in history and may never been repeated ever again i can
(57:40) get drug tested right now i'm on nothing so when you're making these claims you're making an absolute claim on
(57:46) something that's just an assumptive claim it makes no sense all these are
(57:51) abomin Okay to children the reason I'm saying is because there's kids there's young kids that listen to Andrew that
(57:57) look up to you guys right and you're not giving them the correct view of what masculinity is not you i'm saying you're
(58:02) attacking me as a straw man i'm attacking the people that go on these podcasts Myron Games and be caddyy with women that's not masculinity dude and
(58:09) there is a need for masculinity you just contradicted yourself you brought up my whole profession and
(58:15) everything else I do and then you're saying you're not going to bring that up that makes no sense so I'm going to let Andrew move in and defend his point
(58:22) you guys are not a good role model for young men that need masculine role models if they don't have fathers and
(58:28) such i do i have great you know I have you know Medal of Honor uh Medal of Valor I'm sorry Medal of Valor uh First
(58:34) 101st Airborne in my family like I don't need to look to the guy on the internet but unfortunately there's a lot of
(58:40) people that need to look uh and that's that's a separate issue we need to tackle but you guys need to give them
(58:45) the correct uh and give them the righteous masculinity my last point I'm
(58:52) going to make one last point okay I just want to go ahead and make a bridge with you right now is there anything that I
(58:58) do that's not conducive towards masculinity and a net negative as far as being a pro alete and a bodybuilder mind
(59:04) you I turn professional in two sports at a contract and Nike and I do go do talk to students and kids and I do do public
(59:12) speaking and more is that any negative towards society can you see a ne negative from me doing a profession of
(59:18) bodybuilding on the youth or anybody else i don't like bodybuilding because of the steroids and I think it's
(59:23) horrible for kids to see uh even women the view of you know uh Henry Carll being Superman and he's not Superman
(59:30) he's a little dork that has to take [ __ ] you know testosterone to look like that i think that worldview is very bad it's distorted i think is the same
(59:37) distorted worldview when you have this guy you know arguing with quote unquote feminists that if you were truly
(59:42) masculine you just would ignore these people or you would fight them in academia or the court system because
(59:48) that's where we are losing the war in the battle not in [ __ ] YouTube i mean you enterainment right great great great
(59:54) i hear you conflating me with Andrew do not conflate us too you're dealing with me first so once again you're talking
(1:00:00) about needles and stuff like that do I ever present have you ever had a situation where you were presented with
(1:00:06) me showing needles to the public or kids or anything like this or talking about drugs to kids do you see me doing any of
(1:00:11) this you cheated as an athlete that cheated right like you you know you cheated you cheated your own genetics when you you like like you're going to
(1:00:17) have ramifications long term uh that these kids don't really know about because they just see the influencers
(1:00:22) and that's separate i'm kind of drawing a parallel between these fitness influencers not you personally doing steroids because they're not you know
(1:00:28) having a a natural view of masculinity and what Andrew is doing is not the natural view of masculinity either
(1:00:33) because he is arguing and being patty you heard him arguing with this [ __ ] You know what so I'm going to concede
(1:00:40) this because I'm going to concede this because you're unable to go ahead and tell me how I'm a negative view and able
(1:00:46) to demonstrate this and then show how it's not masculine because you're just doing admin attacks i'm going to let
(1:00:52) Andrew defend his worldview right now and leave it up to you guys
(1:00:58) yeah okay uh hang on i had to grab my charger real quick let me uh plug my
(1:01:04) phone yeah go ahead Andrew uh so just to kind of reset I put in the nest here Andrew a net negative so comment in
(1:01:11) there if you think he's a net negative we're not going to give you a mic if you think he's a net positive
(1:01:18) uh actually just go ahead Andrew oh I was going to say so there was um
(1:01:25) there was a lot of emotion there but I didn't I didn't actually hear much in the way of an argument so when you say
(1:01:31) uh natural masculinity what does that mean it just means you know it's a it's it's
(1:01:38) really a thing you have to be to understand i don't think you understand it like because I don't think you are it i think it's cosplaying yeah you're
(1:01:44) cosplaying so I can't I can't look at you and tell you're cosplaying when you can't open a picture you know not being patty with
(1:01:51) women comforting women would be one you would comfort women in a time of crisis you don't attack women in a time of
(1:01:57) crisis um taking care of your kids i think you probably take care of your kids having a
(1:02:03) logical Yeah yeah so so what well just real
(1:02:08) quick just take a take a breath and just tell me kind of what natural masculinity
(1:02:14) is i haven't heard that term well it's not what I just told you taking care of kids being a protector
(1:02:20) um being an example for other boys having a logical analysis not believing
(1:02:26) uh your emotions i don't take care of my kids or No no I'm not saying that i actually said I believe you do and I
(1:02:32) think you should uh go to that but I would say comforting women so instead of attacking women it's not masculine to argue with a woman i'll say do we agree
(1:02:38) with that do you think it's masculine to argue with a woman uh no no what unfort Unfortunately like I can concede that
(1:02:45) there could be uh some ground that I could give here that if women weren't didn't have the same political
(1:02:50) infranchisement as as men then yeah it probably would uh be a bad idea to argue
(1:02:56) with them but the truth of the matter is is that they're just as politically infranchised as you and I don't see how
(1:03:01) ignoring uh you know the cockami feminist ideas is going to be helpful when they could
(1:03:08) just negate your vote like that that to me makes no sense
(1:03:17) dude can you explain that to me well I mean I wouldn't engage them i think I think kind of ignoring I think a lot of
(1:03:23) this uh nonsense needs to be ignored um and you Yeah but they can vote bro yeah
(1:03:30) they can vote but vote in 20 minutes you're gonna argue with this [ __ ] for 20 minutes about Donald
(1:03:35) Trump you're gonna be if you're gonna be mad sandwich like "Oh oh great great."
(1:03:42) And that and and is she going to be able to retain if if I say that and she goes "Oh look they're a bunch of misogynist."
(1:03:48) And goes to her so sewing cluck [ __ ] circle uh they can all vote dude and I
(1:03:54) don't know if you know this or not but women outnumber men in this country and they're worth an equal vote to you i
(1:03:59) don't know why it is that you think that when women have the same political infranchise men as men that you know
(1:04:06) that you just don't have to contend with their ideas like that's absurd well I'd rather see I'm rather be a
(1:04:12) leader of men that's my point that's kind of my preface of what I was kind of saying so as a leader of men uh no I
(1:04:18) would not be engaging uh these crazy feminists with blue hair um
(1:04:26) yeah but I mean how do you expose that any of that's going on if you don't engage with them then they could you
(1:04:32) know what they did and they spent 100 years basically consolidating power this way they were able to consolidate it
(1:04:38) through academia and the the thing is so [ __ ] crazy about it is that it's
(1:04:44) because a lot of it was unchallenged it just went totally unchallenged and it's it's beside like
(1:04:50) it's beyond me why you think that ignoring that is somehow going to make that's just isn't that just sticking
(1:04:56) your head in the sand and just pretending it's not happening well the issue as a net negative is because what you're seeing
(1:05:02) uh this empowering of men I've seen it all the time is like I said there's there's a real vacuum and a need for
(1:05:08) masculinity in this world and we're not getting that so you do have a lot of men that just naturally do not have it um
(1:05:14) they would you know the incel community really is should be cannon fodder for whatever war or whatever invasion we
(1:05:20) historically have we don't have that right now so that's the reason why we have all these incelss wandering around
(1:05:25) and they see guys like you not you specifically but more Myin um and what their um example of masculinity is is
(1:05:32) completely skewed so that's that's where it's a complete net negative if you think these guys are going to you know
(1:05:38) be quote unquote masculine by arguing uh you know sassy and caddyy with these um
(1:05:43) these women it it's just not the thing because again to to my my ultimate point is that men actually do push culture uh
(1:05:51) we push evolution it's biological right so women yeah they can go knit and they could go talk about
(1:05:58) their recipes historically that's what they would do or maybe they could you know burn their bras and have a supper but bro they're politically they're
(1:06:04) politically infranchised dude what are you talking about they're not knitting in their [ __ ] circle they're [ __ ]
(1:06:11) going to the voting booth and voting away your kids dude what do you mean that's not happening camala's not never
(1:06:16) got in hillary would not vote no no sir what woman is getting in to be the leader of the free
(1:06:22) world that day is over no bro do you think do you think that if you look at
(1:06:28) an electoral map and you take out all female voters what does the electoral map look like is it red or is it blue
(1:06:35) the whole thing it's red if you take out all the women voters right yeah it's Why
(1:06:40) why why is it red because women vote Democrat you know in
(1:06:46) higher rates that's that's a separate because women cuz women are talking about you're talking
(1:06:51) about No they're not they're not these are two separate I'm talking about for future men on what masculinity is and
(1:06:58) yeah I'm explaining Yes but I'm explaining can I at least explain the position let me explain the position okay it is tight
(1:07:05) in the idea there is telling you that men that women are voting against men's interests that's I mean that's proof
(1:07:12) it's 100% proof that women are voting against men's interests so if that's the case right
(1:07:19) you saying that we should be like ostriches and stick our head in the sand because engaging with feminists is going
(1:07:24) to require rhetorical flourish um I think it's silly i think it's very shortsighted i think you're just
(1:07:30) sticking your head in the sand and pretending like the problem isn't there it's definitely there i mean and I wish
(1:07:37) I'm fine with other people coming up first of all I've never tied myself into the manosphere you guys do that i'd
(1:07:44) never called myself an alpha male you guys do that the pushing of masculinity that I talk about is virtue based so I
(1:07:51) tie virtues in with gender roles right what I don't do is argue about uh what a
(1:07:57) real man does or doesn't or this type of thing at least not in the context of some alpha hierarchy like you guys
(1:08:03) conflate me and put me in these categories not me i've always only Hang on hang on hang on i'm almost done i'm
(1:08:09) almost done almost done dude i promise you guys put me in the same categories as these red pill content creators and
(1:08:16) I'm just not that guy i've never been that guy i've always argued from a Christian ethics lens and a conservative
(1:08:22) lens that's it well that was my point is that it's kind of a bait and switch for this Christian skyfairy theology which
(1:08:29) isn't going to move the needle either um but to to the prior point was that I think that if men are leaders women will
(1:08:34) follow um unfortunately there are going to be some of these blue-haired weirdos but you know they're just cat ladies
(1:08:40) they're unhappy you know they're not having children um so they're kind of stuck you know confined in their spaces
(1:08:46) but overall men because we push evolution we push genetics we put culture uh women will will will lead you
(1:08:52) know women are are naturally followers so that's the point of like putting them in a position to argue i I do agree
(1:08:59) politically okay well for let me know naturally when how come they naturally
(1:09:04) not following men's lead politically because men get that brings to my point because men are all cosplaying as
(1:09:10) masculinity but don't have a true um look we got 80-year-old man expect Trump is he's an 80-y old [ __ ] man and he's
(1:09:17) the you know he's more masculine than these 20-y old men that are dependent on an 80-y old man to come save their baby but this con but you contradict but
(1:09:24) listen you're contradicting your own position you're saying that men are are biologically they're going to be leaders
(1:09:30) and by necessity women are going to follow them then I ask you well how come they're not doing that right now politically and you say well because
(1:09:35) they're not being leaders it's like you got to have both you got to have one or the other and I'm saying they don't have the correct example that's my point is
(1:09:41) we need to give them the correct well who who Well the thing is is like there's plenty of people to choose from
(1:09:48) if you want to follow and I also don't believe this uh kind of contorted narrative that I have this massively
(1:09:55) young audience that's not what I ever see in my algorithm when we crunch the numbers most of the people who listen to
(1:10:00) me are married men usually pretty close to my age they usually start in their 30s into their mid-40s that's the bigger
(1:10:07) demographic that I have there are some young men that's true but they account for a very small percentage of my audience dude
(1:10:14) I'll land with this i think I think another criticism and it's constructive criticism i think that again so I don't think these young boys growing up have
(1:10:21) masculine role models and so you see a lot of cosplaying and the second point is I think that you kind of are
(1:10:26) admitting that you're kind of doing it for the bait and switch into this dogmatic Christianic real um you know
(1:10:33) your theology based skyfairy you know which let's face it you can never debate that logically and I think a lot would
(1:10:38) be lost if you did debate it logically that you know the ten commandments are good things but if your whole worldview is based on some sky fairy and this idea
(1:10:45) that Joseph uh you know let's face it Joseph was a cuck it's a cucked religion Mary wasn't a virgin some Roman soldier
(1:10:52) came knocked her up and Joseph uh I hate to explain it to you guys but she was this was not a virgin woman this is a
(1:10:58) woman uh that was actually a teenage um you know I don't want to say you know
(1:11:03) bad things whatever happened in that situation she was a you know a teen mom and uh Joseph had to come along and you
(1:11:09) know he bought the whole cuck nonsense about oh it was God that impregnated you so your whole worldview is based on this
(1:11:15) this this just nonsensical dogmatic theology and that's going to be a house of cards in any
(1:11:20) debate and that's actually the probably the bigger issue I have you're not going to have a foundation based on lies and
(1:11:27) then try to you just can't hide from from the fact that everything that you believe in is based on you know Santa
(1:11:33) Claus for all women and you guys can thumb me down all you want but you know you're going to get thrown down that's
(1:11:38) that's not a problem you're going to get thrown down for sure i mean the stuff you're yapping on about is absurd and ridiculous not only that but you have no
(1:11:46) alternative to provide buddy i mean all we've seen from the red pill I'm not done i'm not
(1:11:54) done i'm not I'm not done i'm not done santa Claus hey hey i don't care if you're
(1:12:01) insecure i'm not done i'm not done yo I'm not I'm not done i'm not done do you
(1:12:09) not understand words he's a certain Yeah i'm just going to reset the space
(1:12:15) real quick in the nest it says "Is Andrew a net negative?" Just comment in there if you want a mic you feel he's a
(1:12:22) net negative we're not really uh bringing up people that think he's a net positive trying to settle this right now
(1:12:29) andrew a net negative hey Rachel nice to see you um so Sarcis by all means you
(1:12:35) can jump in uh Glenn let Sarcus speak andrew you jump in wherever you want uh
(1:12:41) so that's uh what we're doing i do see some hands up so unless you comment in the nest I really don't know who's got a
(1:12:47) net negative i don't want to waste Andrew's time here yeah I'm sorry man i'm just sick of these wannabe wannabe
(1:12:54) red pill hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on real quick yeah real quick um I like I was happy to address
(1:13:01) that guy's criticisms right like I hear this a lot christianity is a cucked religion you
(1:13:06) have no logical basis from which to argue from it even though I do all the time I don't I don't know what he's talking about i'm happy to engage in
(1:13:12) that yeah I'm just 100% yeah absolutely
(1:13:19) that's your prerogative but I was You said you said sarcus yeah let my No no let
(1:13:27) Andrew go so he can respond uh so because when was talking one thing I do want to point out is to this point we've
(1:13:33) only had like two people out of 500 comment in the nest saying he's a net
(1:13:39) negative so that's right that really people don't agree with you if you think
(1:13:45) he's a net negative people actually don't agree with you so just going to put that out there no he's definitely
(1:13:51) not a net negative but go ahead Andrew i apologize buddy do your thing
(1:14:08) andrew you did you plug your phone in are you you there buddy
(1:14:15) yeah you guys keep muting me and so I don't know i'm muted um but any anyway
(1:14:20) yeah I was just saying like in the future I'm happy to respond to those types of things like uh he was he was
(1:14:25) being respectful enough um that even if he's misinformed I'm I'm happy to like
(1:14:30) kind of dive into those things but we can save that for another time that's all I was going to say
(1:14:37) uh whoever there's three people got your hands up any of you have uh think Andrew's a net negative not really i
(1:14:46) just had one thing to say so far this place is Can I say something i waited an
(1:14:51) hour yeah go ahead this space has been [ __ ] gay so far and it ain't Andrew
(1:14:56) so far right before he came in oh shame shaming women is bad the first thing the
(1:15:02) feminist did was shame his wife who wasn't even here to defend herself who's supposed to be an independent woman so
(1:15:08) therefore she should be allowed to defend herself and then I thought "Oh Blend's here blend's finally going to give me a reason for why I should refund
(1:15:15) my sub." Yeah and stop following the man and I had high hopes and then he started with his feminist shaming language i'm
(1:15:22) not a Christian i would rather as a woman who is submissive and a bit of a pick me sometimes I'd rather follow
(1:15:28) Andrew any day than you and I'm not a Christian and the reason is is because he actually is a man of honor he has
(1:15:36) actual things that he talks about that make sense to me that resonate with me i don't need to be a Christian to know
(1:15:41) that the man has faith and I respect that that the man has an actual sense of
(1:15:47) duty to the world all you've done is come up you've attacked an athlete
(1:15:52) calling him "Oh you're not naughty you do injections." I don't give a [ __ ] that is masculine there is a high level of
(1:15:58) suicide right now with men men need athletes to look up to men need other men like that to look up to men that are
(1:16:04) looking after themselves and respecting themselves and honoring themselves there's nothing wrong with that you're
(1:16:11) [ __ ] gay okay you can put me down to listener if you want now thank you
(1:16:18) damn well thanks for the sub no Red Barb OG she's [ __ ] amazing
(1:16:25) she's She's legit i just wanted to say man I'm just sick and tired of Red Pillars coming in man
(1:16:31) they have no alternative other than their [ __ ] fantasies and then they point fingers at everybody else like
(1:16:36) there's one thing to be a man and there's one thing to be a delusional cuck who's pretending to be a man and that's the [ __ ] problem because any
(1:16:43) any That's the funny part is like I debate with those those guys as much as I debate with feminists it's crazy i
(1:16:48) don't know how you do it bro part Kudos to you Andrew like [ __ ] the jar thing kudos to you bro i don't have the
(1:16:55) patience for that [ __ ] man i like [ __ ] my life bro do do your thing i will say it's it's good to actually hear I'm not
(1:17:02) called for this bro i'm not called for this by God bro god bless you dog like straight up so like like I was saying it
(1:17:09) feels good to hear what she was saying especially about athletes that's a very good point um I often get railed against
(1:17:15) and attacked for this and the critics is like long as the the days are long as
(1:17:21) far as me being an athlete and what I've done so I definitely appreciate that because it's very far and few between
(1:17:26) and we do we do prevent a lot of things that happen i think that men's fit fitness needs to go ahead and be
(1:17:33) promoted in America i think the greatest disease in America is inactivity and that's literally what I promote so our
(1:17:39) essay rates and you know selfdeion rates are increasing so men are taking themselves out by I mean the numbers
(1:17:46) you're talking about like it it's the numbers are just astronomical at this point it's actually climbing as far as
(1:17:51) men's depression rates what I'm doing is actually against that being an athlete an advocate for health and fitness this
(1:17:58) is also towards good mental health and fitness and nutrition everything else so there's much more that is encompassing
(1:18:05) in this it's a very comprehensive approach i just don't say "Hey just shoot a needle do all this other stuff."
(1:18:10) You'll never hear any of this so I'm an advocate for good mental health through physical activity and just good
(1:18:16) oldfashioned stuff that dad used to do on the field and then show you as a kid that's it
(1:18:22) well who cares anyway where are bodybuilders destroying society nowhere so who gives a [ __ ] i don't give
(1:18:28) a flying [ __ ] about about [ __ ] bodybuilders who might juice something i could give I give no [ __ ] show me where
(1:18:35) they're where they're a destructive force in society and then until then I don't give about it it means that it
(1:18:41) means it means you need to pump yourself up you need to pump yourself up with needles and you need to pump yourself up with the Bible so that's the point I was
(1:18:47) trying to make so to sus your point was how the alternative is just tell the
(1:18:52) truth right the sky fairy that's goat herders that [ __ ] car up you have nothing to correspond
(1:18:59) with there's nothing in history go stupid yeah because you're offended because I'm the truth everybody hates
(1:19:05) the truth no one's offended i'm not I'm not offended i'm
(1:19:11) willing to engage with you right like I'm willing to engage with you on this topic you say that this is the truth
(1:19:17) okay how do you account for truth in your worldview what is truth well I know not what's not truth you know like
(1:19:24) something that Well then that would mean then that would mean that you know what truth is so how do you account for it i
(1:19:29) mean how do you account for truth well the burden of proof you listen you if you think Jesus died and came back and he's God like the burden of proof is not
(1:19:35) on me uh to to to play king then give me that's why I'm bro bro bro bro bro
(1:19:42) bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro bro that's what I'm asking you I'm literally asking you for a standard that you would accept for evidence by
(1:19:48) ask even ask the question are you going to let me ask the question okay so the
(1:19:54) question is how do you account for truth you say well you're making extraordinary claim yeah I'll be up there in a second
(1:20:00) You're making an extraordinary claim you need to provide extraordinary evidence well actually this is baked into what I'm asking you i'm asking you how you
(1:20:06) account for truth how do you actually do that what is the standard for truth for you what is
(1:20:13) that well it's what I can observe right and what's what I can quantify and if somebody makes an extraordinary claim I
(1:20:19) don't have the burden of proof you know logically I don't have the burden of proof to to prove that uh in in history we've never had a woman that was never
(1:20:27) had sexual i mean maybe potentially you know she's in a hot tub or something in terms you know travels in the hot tub
(1:20:33) but you know without sexual intercourse it's very rare that a human being is going to be consumed so when you make that claim that there's a human being
(1:20:40) consumed because a sky fairy and not a Roman soldier then I'm sorry sir that
(1:20:45) burden is not uh that that that's your burden to bear not mine yeah yeah so so
(1:20:50) so just so you understand I agree with you that a person making a claim has a burden however the burden of proof has
(1:20:57) to be comparable to the worldview itself so if you say "Look I need you to prove something to me." That's fair i'm not
(1:21:05) disputing that that's a fair claim for you to make what I am disputing is what your burden of proof standard is that's
(1:21:11) what I need to know what is it it's extraordinary extraordinary how do you know what's true extraordinary claims actually they take some bit of evidence
(1:21:16) like I could say Harry Potter uh you know or the Lord of the Rings there's some special ring out there and Goyam's
(1:21:23) holding it and if and if you if I use the same standard that you use and apply uh to critically think we could say true
(1:21:29) because it's in a book and I have faith that that's true i don't this doesn't this doesn't have anything to do with
(1:21:35) what I'm asking you i'm asking you what is your standards for truth sure it does but you've been indoctrinated and and
(1:21:41) you have this some quote unquote faith so you can't accept what is your standard for truth dude I told you what
(1:21:48) is your standard quantifiable truth is so if you so if you observe so
(1:21:53) if you observe something on the TV it's true dude listen sir this is the thing this is why you're catty like we know
(1:21:59) deep down answer my answer my question answer my question there's a macro point being made and you want to get in the
(1:22:05) weeds and try to do this caddy [ __ ] nonsense we're not getting in the weeds we're not getting in the weeds you make
(1:22:12) I'm literally just trying to Yeah I'm what I'm saying to you is that I don't
(1:22:17) believe that you can ground truth absence uh some sort of higher power in this case I would say God but I'm
(1:22:24) willing to hear you out if you can establish truth claims outside of that i just want to know what your standard is
(1:22:31) because when you ask me and say "Andrew provide me evidence for X thing." How the [ __ ] could I do that if I don't even know what your standard for truth is
(1:22:37) well you know you can't do it anyways because you know you don't you you know you're just going to rely on faith in a and a Are you going to give me your
(1:22:42) standard are you going to give me your standard for truth can't do it so you're trying to wiggle that's what I'm saying you're deflecting and then this is your
(1:22:48) debate tactic let me wiggle out away something that I cannot prove so let me put the burden on him i don't have the burden sir it doesn't matter what the
(1:22:54) [ __ ] I think truth is i'm not putting any burden bro i'm not putting any It doesn't matter not a romantic it doesn't
(1:23:00) matter what you I see so it doesn't matter what it doesn't matter what what
(1:23:05) you think the truth is but I'm supposed to provide proof for you brilliant [ __ ] analysis dude what's your truth
(1:23:12) based on faith in this uh you know goat hurting book 2,000 years ago well is my truth the truth listen you my
(1:23:20) truth the truth or is your truth the truth you come into the manuscer to do a bait and switch to push your [ __ ] religious woo woo nonsense and what it
(1:23:27) is is a bait and switch that's why I said I'm not in the [ __ ] manosphere sure you aren't literally not listen sir
(1:23:33) okay I'll give you that whatever you do you admitted like all you are is a rebranded youth pastor that's what I look at you the guy you'd have a guitar
(1:23:39) like I said 30 years ago you'd be saying "Hey man yeah let's go play some guitar hey did you hear about Jesus?" And now
(1:23:44) what you're doing is you're saying "Hey yeah man these feminists." Well actually guess what i'm actually someone you know in the court system going in got to you
(1:23:51) know got Bro I don't preach bro i don't preach
(1:23:56) it's all oh yeah this is comes to my Christian and blah blah my worldview this is what that's what your worldview is and it's it's disastrous yeah that's
(1:24:02) called logical that's logical if you think you're there's no logic in Christianity how can you you
(1:24:08) can give me your standard for truth and you're going to get murdered give me your standard for truth because you don't have a feminist whenever that you
(1:24:15) can play games when am I going to get murdered okay bro when am I going to get murdered in the debate you can't answer a single
(1:24:21) question you cannot listen the burner proofs on you how can I How can I [ __ ] How can I prove something to you
(1:24:28) if I don't know what dude listen you got to listen i don't have to listen i can't prove a thing to the first time you've
(1:24:34) been around this is pointless this is pointless mood at this point because the the guy just refuses to
(1:24:42) accept you know I got for you bro yeah yeah yeah if we're going to go in a
(1:24:47) circle with Andrew it's just kind of a waste of his time i audience yeah protect protect the slaughter and his
(1:24:54) logical fallacy what you got to protect bro you're circular you're circular it's not circular dude he knows he can't
(1:25:00) prove his work let me just say get [ __ ] blown up so you have to put the on
(1:25:10) my protect holy [ __ ] bro andrew's been respectful enough to give you some of
(1:25:15) his time um so there's no other opportunity you would had to like speak
(1:25:20) to him um I mean might as well be respectful andrew I the only thing I'll
(1:25:26) ask I know you probably got to go but like there are probably a couple people that want to say some nice things about you some testimonies if you would just
(1:25:33) maybe allow like one or two people to like thank you and stuff i'll be one of them actually i appreciate you man uh
(1:25:40) yeah you can it's safe to say you've kind of changed my life and so I appreciate that uh appreciate you also
(1:25:47) uh Marte as well um so I'll let Jacith go he's been waiting uh some time if
(1:25:53) Andrew approves Jacith and Selena uh and Sarcis uh you can say your last thing
(1:25:59) but you got to land your plane though but you got to you can say if Andrew allows
(1:26:06) yeah i mean that's not a problem i'm just I'll just real quick reiterate this um if if you ask me to demonstrate for
(1:26:13) you proof for a thing then me asking or requesting what your standard for truth
(1:26:18) or for proof is would be the opposite of illogical you say that I keep on putting a burden on you but I'm not putting a
(1:26:25) burden on you i'm not even all I'm I'm not even making an argument yet i'm just asking a question so that we can even
(1:26:31) talk to each other that's no you're you're you're obscating the point and you're going to say it's faith i already
(1:26:37) know I've had these conversations you know you know this isn't my first uh pony uh you're going to say faith and
(1:26:42) faith is not good enough for me the book is not good enough for me you actually have to have some type of evidence something that's quantifiable like I
(1:26:47) said you asked you asked me what my truth is i said something that's evident and quantifiable what can you give me
(1:26:53) that's evident and quantifiable that a woman was conceived without having sexual intercourse go ahead please
(1:27:02) yeah so do you do you understand though that when you say that your your theory of truth which it sounds like it's maybe
(1:27:08) a correspondence theory um when you say it relies on empiricism or things in
(1:27:14) which you observe then what are the standards for the things that you currently believe that you observe in an
(1:27:20) empirical which you would claim are true can you give me a couple of examples of those yeah my refrigerator right now uh
(1:27:25) it's making my water cool and I'm going to go drink a little water from my refrigerator i can open the door um I
(1:27:31) was actually born you know my father had sex with my mom uh I wasn't there well actually I was there so I know that's
(1:27:36) true i've had sex with women and a child has came out i don't know anyone that a woman that's actually had a baby
(1:27:44) uh without having sex so if you can give me another example besides um this gold herder uh children's fantasy uh Santa
(1:27:51) Claus [ __ ] I'm all for it but you can't and you know you can't so you have to
(1:27:57) okay well look it's it's at this point there's nothing more I can do if you if you don't understand what I'm asking
(1:28:03) nothing you ever could do and you know that that's why you're deflecting because I'm asking you for quantifiable evidence that a woman has ever had a
(1:28:10) baby without having sex and you can't do it and you know you can't do it and so this is why you have yo blender let's drop this we can address this ourselves
(1:28:16) bro this isn't something Andrew needs to worry about honestly but you're I got low you know we've had a lot of good
(1:28:22) positive talks together man so so let's approach this in good good faith Blender you and I but we could do this in
(1:28:27) another space or after Andrew leaves let's not waste his time for nothing but this is something I could I could I
(1:28:33) could Listen let me finish you're not letting me finish a single [ __ ] sentence dude like you can't be like this you can't be like this i could
(1:28:40) dissect your argument like 105 different ways i could dissect your argument 105 different ways and provide so many
(1:28:47) different ways of proving you wrong to Yeah it's not even a problem i'm not even a [ __ ] apologist but this is so
(1:28:53) easy this is like elementary school level and you know you can't either i'm not going to do it now bro like this is
(1:28:59) not what this space is about what's wrong with you you have such a problem with God bro that you can't even like
(1:29:04) you you just can't like you can't control yourself right now that is not a masculine trait at all dude come on man
(1:29:11) get get with the program andrew do your thing brother like nothing but love dog like [ __ ] my life yeah
(1:29:18) let we'll talk blender blender we'll talk we'll I'll take care of
(1:29:23) uh Andrew's agreed to like uh if you want to say some things to him real quick before he's got to go selena go
(1:29:29) ahead yes hi thank you thank you you know um I just want to say I think what Andrew is
(1:29:35) doing is actually great and I watched the show and I'm laughing plenty because what people um don't understand is that
(1:29:43) shaming can be corrective not cruel right and spec specifically in our
(1:29:49) western culture we need that because as he said right feminist vote and they usually vote for degeneracy and if you
(1:29:56) don't correct that right uh the society is going to kind of collapse into moral
(1:30:03) idotropy and it's it is what it is right and uh for us orthodox people women have
(1:30:09) a very special place and there is some sort of a modesty that is associated with the faith right and yeah I think
(1:30:15) whatever he's doing is Great i enjoy it and um for you I don't remember who it was but whoever the guy you shouldn't be
(1:30:22) so triggered because he is calling out the feminist you should be actually supporting that because this is what
(1:30:28) makes your country degenerate precisely the freedom that they don't deserve
(1:30:34) thank you that's all uh Jake go
(1:30:41) yeah I was just gonna briefly touch on uh Blended's uh address uh not
(1:30:49) addressing Myin uh Myin doesn't uh advocate for arguing with women he only
(1:30:54) does that to demonstrate what he teaches on his day shows to the guys and it's
(1:31:01) not for he's not advocating for guys to argue with women he actually advocates for guys to not argue with women and and
(1:31:09) I completely love what Andrew does and Andrew is a great uh voice for the
(1:31:14) Christian community and he's an excellent debater i was uh watching his
(1:31:19) debate with uh that creature he did on the whatever podcast and like it the way
(1:31:28) he uh was able to formulate his arguments
(1:31:34) is spoton and the way she wasn't even able Oh sorry to mute you Jith but yeah
(1:31:42) yeah Andrew's a beast man totally uh Zora you're next
(1:31:47) uh God bless brother thank you um I actually had a kind of a neutral comment and thank you because I didn't want to
(1:31:53) disrespect your space thank you for having me up here uh to the host and co-host guys god bless you all and um I
(1:31:58) was just going to say this whole issue with people calling each other names it just comes from an area of of
(1:32:06) ill-informed emotions that seem to just uh destroy a person's rationality and
(1:32:11) like uh logic altogether it it I've come up with this saying that wisdom can be
(1:32:16) the cause to pause before you react and someone who is not acting in wisdom will just lash out in their emotions and not
(1:32:23) have any correct form or means of getting their their communication out so
(1:32:28) that's what I keep seeing i don't know what it is about this man that triggers everybody so much if you can just
(1:32:34) separate what he is saying from whatever it is that they're taking as a point of
(1:32:40) contention you'll realize he's not being combative he's uh acting against what
(1:32:45) they are throwing towards him and I just can't see the problem there guys uh but
(1:32:50) I'll add that one thing coming from a single father who takes care of his disabled mother uh going back to school
(1:32:56) to get my degree in education Andrew's logic has helped me write my thesis and it's been probably the best help I've
(1:33:02) received uh during my process so with that my dear friends thank you again for letting me share god bless you Andrew
(1:33:07) and Rachel everyone I hope you have a great day awesome Zor thank you uh take
(1:33:12) one more and uh I also want to add that
(1:33:17) uh well let's just go ahead let's go with uh Jumb Jambala
(1:33:23) come on Uncle Thomas jumbalaya you know what jumba oh I I can't see I can't see the whole I can't see the whole thing i
(1:33:30) did want to say uh Sorry i did want to say that anybody who didn't get to um speak to Andrew about him being net
(1:33:37) negative you're more than welcome to stay in the space for a little bit i'm happy to debate you on how he's a net
(1:33:43) positive i don't even think you can get through me in a debate so it doesn't even matter if you talk to Andrew or not
(1:33:49) you got to even try to get through me so happy stick around um if you want to
(1:33:57) yeah so I just want to uh double mute i think I go
(1:34:07) okay yeah i just want to say thanks for teaching me uh what uh spurting out is i didn't know what that meant and I had to
(1:34:13) look it up and I love it every time I hear it um and I watch you guys quite often um and because you do have a
(1:34:20) biblical worldview it actually gives you the authority to speak to all of these things because you're not starting with
(1:34:26) you know I isms and me isms you're you're appealing to a higher authority which in this case makes sense you
(1:34:32) cannot determine what masculinity is from evolution because we're watching a devolution happening in real time you
(1:34:39) have to start with something that created what a man even is to know how to argue what masculinity is so thanks
(1:34:45) guys i appreciate you great supporter god bless
(1:34:50) hey thank you i appreciate that very kind words always very humbling for me to hear them so I appreciate that rachel
(1:34:57) you came up you grabbed a mic did you have anything you wanted to add yeah hey thanks for bringing me up i
(1:35:04) just wanted to say um it's always hilarious to me you always know who
(1:35:09) Andrew's dumbest critics are because they're always the people that all they've ever seen is a few of the viral
(1:35:16) clips from whatever which I keep trying to explain to people and I think they know this they're just ragebait clips
(1:35:23) they're always going to be the most shocking the most outlandish the most crazy clips right none of these people
(1:35:31) sat down and watched his 2-hour long you know formal debate with Rid Van Idmir on
(1:35:37) you know Zionism they didn't sit down and watch his 2-hour plus long debate with Dave Smith on libertarianism they
(1:35:45) didn't watch his you know debates with Bosch and Destiny on things like the J6 insurrection or immigration you know uh
(1:35:53) they he's done way more and all the actual fans know this that he's done way
(1:35:58) way more than just argue with girls on whatever that's a small small portion of what he does it just tends to go viral
(1:36:06) pretty often so it's just a total straw man it's a totally false fake critique
(1:36:11) and all it does is prove that you really don't watch Andrew you really don't know what he's talking about and you have no
(1:36:16) idea what he actually does for a living you just saw a clip and now you think you know um the only other thing I
(1:36:22) wanted to say was that Nutty Khalifa chick she's been super obsessed with me for like two years now don't know why
(1:36:29) have other than the fact that she's obsessed with this Peter guy and she got this idea in her head that he and I know
(1:36:36) each other i think I've had five DMs with the man and it was only because of
(1:36:41) her it was I when she started pedalling this conspiracy theory I looked him up
(1:36:47) and found him and was like "Do you know this person she thinks that you're my mentor uh it's really bizarre right and
(1:36:53) he was like "Oh yeah she she and I used to work together be friends and we had a big falling out and now this is what she
(1:36:59) does." Um in regards to some Patreon thing I went and listened to the space
(1:37:04) that she alleges this Dean guy says that he could see this public discussion between me and Peter on Patreon i did
(1:37:12) not even hear that and it's like a 4 and a half hour long space i skimmed through it as much as I could did not even hear
(1:37:18) the guy say that if I spoke with Peter on Patreon I don't remember it i
(1:37:24) probably didn't know who he was and finally my book was published in 2021 when I certainly had never heard of
(1:37:32) Peter Wright didn't know any i really didn't know anything about the red pill the manosphere none of that which is
(1:37:37) great because I got to form my opinions like totally outside of that i wasn't even in that part of the internet whatsoever so unless she can prove that
(1:37:44) in the two and a half years of research I was doing between 2019 and 2021 that I
(1:37:50) was like frequently corresponding with this guy or something it's just silly i
(1:37:55) mean not that anyone cares nobody knows who the [ __ ] this natty nutty nutty Khalifa is um but she's just like
(1:38:02) mentally deranged so don't don't worry about her that's all I was going to say don't worry nutty is our community
(1:38:08) retort u but he's okay yeah and we've never called her nutty i
(1:38:14) know I haven't i've always called her nattty and why I'll call her nutty it's definitely nutty it's 100% good
(1:38:21) call on that this happens all the time where like people I have no idea why they'll become completely obsessed with
(1:38:28) me and just like make up whole entire story it's just wild but I guess that's the internet's full of crazy people but
(1:38:35) thanks for not only not only that but here's what's funny right if if I knew
(1:38:40) anything about this guy and he had good views that I liked I would just tell you
(1:38:46) i would just be like "Yeah I totally agree with this or that or whatever the thing was." You know what I mean oh yeah
(1:38:53) i don't even have an like I don't even have enough understanding of what this guy [ __ ] does to even tell you if I
(1:39:00) agree with a single view he has well in my in my few DMs with him about her
(1:39:06) again this is like I don't know 6 months or a year ago when she was running around spreading this conspiracy theory
(1:39:13) that's the only reason we ever even got in communication was because of her and she I was like she thinks that I like
(1:39:20) borrowed something about chivalry from you and we actually disagree me and Peter disagree about the role of
(1:39:27) chivalry and history and stuff like that if you read my book and the chapter on it I actually take an opposite view from
(1:39:33) his view on chivalry and how it works and he sent me his essay on it and was like "Yeah we actually totally disagree
(1:39:39) but you should read my opinion and see what you think." So she's just literally making up crazy stuff
(1:39:49) all right well that's all I had guys i'm going to go eat some breakfast thanks for uh thanks for letting me come in and defend myself in this space i really
(1:39:54) appreciate it thanks for showing up Andrew absolutely thanks Andrew thanks Rachel
(1:40:02) thank you Rachel i just wanted to assert Rachel too that uh I have read your book and that is a and I've read Peter
(1:40:08) Wright's essay on it you're completely accurate there's there's a complete differation in opinion
(1:40:22) yeah thanks again we're keeping it open a little bit longer anybody who thinks Andrew's a net negative grab a mic i'll
(1:40:29) be happy to uh you know take the side of him being a net positive more than happy yeah i
(1:40:35) don't even know why this was required but I'm going be honest with you like I don't think anyone who has a brain can
(1:40:40) say that he's net negative like we could we could punk on dude for the jar thing which I I have
(1:40:47) done but we're men but uh uh uh other than that it's really only a net
(1:40:52) negative if your worldview is degeneracy right yeah exactly there's no like
(1:40:58) there's no approach where you could justify him as a net negative like there's none whatso whether you like him
(1:41:03) or not you just cannot do that you know well you might you might have also you
(1:41:09) might have noticed that the people who had the criticisms they actually weren't criticizing Andrew so one guy came up
(1:41:15) and was like I actually hate Christianity and that's why I hate Andrew and then another and then Natty
(1:41:22) was like "Well I hate Peter Wright and that's why I hate Andrew." It's always like some topic or person i don't think
(1:41:27) we could ever take Natty seriously like whatever wherever she comes from like honestly I don't think we Rachel nobody
(1:41:36) I listened to in the space actually attacked any of Andrew's ideas any of
(1:41:41) his arguments at all that it was always something adjacent to Andrew that they I hate the red pills so I hate Andrew or I
(1:41:48) don't like bodybuilding and that's why Andrew doesn't even do bodybuilding so it's like they don't actually ever they
(1:41:56) don't address Andrew or Andrew's arguments at all it's always something adjacent to him that they're associating
(1:42:02) with him and it's just his haters are dumb honestly they're just dumb that's what makes it comedy and and this is
(1:42:09) exactly why Naan hosted this space because she loves comedy and uh yeah yeah and I'm gonna or it
(1:42:16) leads to an attack personally or some sort of tone policing or oh your debate tactics it's like who gives a [ __ ] about
(1:42:23) their debate tactics if and what matters is the content of what they're saying i don't care how the person debates well
(1:42:29) their tactic is about what the person's actually saying to me their tactic is always to talk over right so um and
(1:42:36) that's what happened virtually with everyone um I'm going to stir the pot a little bit since Rachel stuck around so
(1:42:43) Zoe um actually guys I do have to get going i got a doctor appointment I got to run to i'm sorry but thanks for
(1:42:50) having me you're good you're good i actually have to go too so I'd like to say some last words before I take off so
(1:42:56) Rachel can I tell you something before you leave i agree with you completely your husband was right he was attacked i
(1:43:02) I've heard him from the very beginning the stuff that he says is fundamentally true with like the morals and the ethics
(1:43:07) right and I understand that he argues with all these red pill people and he gets associated with them wrongly
(1:43:13) obviously however the whole debate people attack religion they attacked
(1:43:18) everything but him and they didn't even attack any of his points and they made themselves look like fools and let
(1:43:24) Andrew know that I said that okay we'll do thank you very much yeah have a good one thank you thank you boi
(1:43:34) uh Gabriel hey can I can I say something before I I bounce oh oh yeah sorry Marte
(1:43:40) yeah Marte okay so I I just want to make it clear that the reason why um Andrew was
(1:43:46) brought up and why I tagged him in this whole discussion um he and I'm going to go ahead and just uh give you an example
(1:43:54) if ever I tag him I I don't abuse this and it's like I don't actually to
(1:43:59) believe it or not I don't want to bring him up the reason why I don't want to bring him up is because um it's like if
(1:44:05) I cry wolf all the time and it's for some measly stuff the only time I'll ever bring him up and the reason why I
(1:44:11) originally brought him up just to make it clear is because I can defend Andrew
(1:44:16) to a certain point but when it comes to things that he might have said in
(1:44:21) accuracy out of my presence and things that were said in other rooms I can defend him but I can't defend absolute
(1:44:28) claims as far as like did he say this i don't know you know so we can only defend our friends uh to a certain point
(1:44:36) but when it comes to him defending things that he he may have said from third parties and things like that I
(1:44:42) it's hard for me and somebody else to defend that because it's just hearsay so I will bring him in just like I'll bring
(1:44:48) Uncle Tom in or anybody else in if they're being talked about behind their back and I'm like "Okay I want them to
(1:44:54) defend themselves because I I consider myself a good friend of him if he's going to defend himself I'm going to say
(1:45:00) "Hey look this is being said be behind your back whatever." Or this discussion
(1:45:05) is being said I don't want to put words in your mouth this type of thing i think that if you're a good friend you would do this but once again um he's like uh I
(1:45:13) told Uncle Tom this it's like using a Thanos snap i only want to do this like a couple times if I have to in case of
(1:45:19) emergency break glass type of thing but I'm glad he did show up i said that he has like a 100% show rate if I ever tag
(1:45:26) him uh up to this date but I love talking and defending defending him and all this other stuff but when it comes
(1:45:32) to people putting words in his mouth um I will let him know and uh that's the
(1:45:38) only reason why I brought him up so that's it
(1:45:45) thanks babe yeah thank you so much for bringing him in i mean I think it was uh productive i mean all the people that
(1:45:51) were in here got to see the literally only three critics and
(1:45:57) then those three critics were batshit crazy most of it so didn't you know another W for Andrew
(1:46:04) i mean it was it was the the natty person the nutty person was insufferable like we could barely get a word in
(1:46:11) edge-wise for me to even be uh also the the other person that did serve in the military i wanted to at least say "Hey
(1:46:18) you know what i appreciate your service something like that so um it's funny one last note before I leave he was
(1:46:24) conflating bodybuilding and and juicing and all this other stuff and Andrew is completely right about that you know
(1:46:30) what have bodybuilders done to destroy society or cause any harm we're almost in the shadow realm we're obscure from
(1:46:37) society we're almost like a shadow sport that's not even rarely on ESPN or anything else we don't even get
(1:46:43) recognition we're barely could martialize or anything like that but so I I think it was definitely felacious so
(1:46:48) I had to defend that and kept redirecting it to me because like Rachel said he doesn't do bodybuilding he was
(1:46:54) conflating the two and all this so of course I'm going to defend bodybuilding i'm a professional athlete in two pro
(1:46:59) sports so um I'm also Andrew's coach and trainer he's eating probably a breakfast
(1:47:04) I've prescribed him to eat but that's the thing though is like I think that u that's been exposed here the three
(1:47:11) facious arguments that we've heard from the three people um it's been highlighted and magnified by Andrew and
(1:47:17) um themselves as well too does that mean if Andrew gains weight it's your fault yeah I have to take the
(1:47:25) L on that yeah you heard it here you heard it here also I I can't
(1:47:30) Oh just just go ahead just remember that the pickle jar thing happened i
(1:47:36) Everybody knows about me after pickle jar so that's now not my fault because of that too
(1:47:43) yes no I was going to use No I mean that's a technicality i'm going to use it so you should you definitely I I
(1:47:50) wouldn't blame you for it uh personally but uh no I just I just feel interesting because most people argue based off
(1:47:56) their own ignorance like they have no concept of what bodybuilding actually is they don't have the experience of it
(1:48:01) they don't know what it takes to be in the gym they don't know how to they don't know what it means to actually uh like build your body to that level
(1:48:08) whether you're using um you know well here here's the thing
(1:48:14) or not but I just want to say like it's it's still a [ __ ] ton of work is my point and you cannot right deny that i'm
(1:48:21) going to expound upon that point that you made and this rarely gets talked about let's say I do a boatload of drugs
(1:48:28) and a [ __ ] ton of things and I give somebody else that do you think we would grow at the same rate because we don't
(1:48:33) have the same genetics probably not right you know genetics uh in somebody else may be different to somebody else
(1:48:39) and somebody else and also there's a [ __ ] ton of work i to be honest with you I almost died turning pro and I turned
(1:48:45) pro damn near natural because I grew up with a fear of needles they used to give me these little tetanis shots what are
(1:48:51) those little tiny baby needles those little TV shots you get i passed out you know and the nurses staff used to make
(1:48:56) fun of me doing this stuff cuz I worked for law enforcement at the time and they were like "No because we had these mandatory dumbass [ __ ] shots we had
(1:49:02) to take." I passed out so before nationals uh before I took first in the nation be out 50 people who won Mr
(1:49:08) chicago Mr washington i had to beat 50 of the best in the nation including Mr white just to turn pro the odds of
(1:49:15) turning pro are like [ __ ] insane so I almost died turning pro because
(1:49:20) hypoglycemia i had like a a lung infection all this other [ __ ] still turned pro and then after that I was
(1:49:26) like "Fuck I might as well start doing something because it's an unequal playing field even though I turned pro naturally." So I can then say that so
(1:49:34) nobody ever knows the background but if that guy had asked the question and said "Hey do you use steroids do you do
(1:49:40) anything like this?" I would have been blatantly honest with them because I have nothing to lose for doing this in
(1:49:46) fact it actually promotes anti-substances if I tell people I turn pro naturally it was only after I turned
(1:49:51) pro but even then to your point I have to [ __ ] eat every 3 hours 2 hours i
(1:49:56) have to train hard as [ __ ] like and my bo my skin has to be onion thin to where I'm a human muscle chart when people see
(1:50:03) me and that's not a comfortable condition to be like this is [ __ ] insane right i'm going against my body's
(1:50:08) natural need to be [ __ ] alive and do all this i'm my body fat's going so low that you need body fat to cushion organs
(1:50:15) and joints right all that's being [ __ ] scrapped and now it's like you're living in a state that you would
(1:50:21) not survive in at like over 2 weeks right so yeah to your point it is tough even if a boatload of steroids do happen
(1:50:28) to be ejected in my body I would get my ass beat by anybody else who's doing all the natural work so you're totally right
(1:50:35) about that exactly and that's my premise you know it's like I don't think people should be
(1:50:41) arguing based on things they don't know anything about because like people often
(1:50:46) pretend that they know something but they haven't actually experienced it or even being adjacent to it like I had I
(1:50:52) had a bodybuilder buddy in in college that humbled the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of me like the guy was incredible the the
(1:50:59) discipline the the work effort and a lot of people don't understand it's not like you just take [ __ ] steroids and peeds
(1:51:06) and magically like grow like you still got to put in the [ __ ] effort this is what people don't also there's also the
(1:51:13) risk assessment too you you have to understand though like let's say I did prescribe to a [ __ ] ton of drugs which I
(1:51:19) don't um the top bodybuilders the reason why it's assumed that we take a shitload of stuff is because we don't talk to
(1:51:25) anybody about this [ __ ] because it's a class 4 substance and first of all it's illegal and we can't [ __ ] outright do
(1:51:31) this if they legalize this [ __ ] then we can have a a real legalized uh [ __ ]
(1:51:36) dose system to where doctors can look over us and all this other [ __ ] but because they don't do this it's now a black market sport unfortunately I'm
(1:51:43) just going to be honest with you all there's no such thing as a natural uh pro bodybuilder it doesn't exist in the IBB or in Super League the other pro
(1:51:50) that I turn uh sport I turned pro in which is equivalent to strong world strongman so that's the thing though is
(1:51:56) there's also risk too if you're going to be Formula 1 racer you're going to lighten your tires you're going to lighten the body the chassis everything
(1:52:02) else and you're going to increase the speed what else increases the risk of death right bodybuilding I hate to tell
(1:52:08) you it's the it's not the healthiest sport in the world but also we're taking big risk too here right dehydrating
(1:52:15) ourselves to the point to where it just costs a heart all this other stuff right so it's like they they don't understand
(1:52:21) the sacrifices we're making even though it's dumb as [ __ ] as it sounds even if I didn't do bodybuilding that I'm doing
(1:52:27) this and pushing my bodies to extreme doing all this other stuff but when I look at kids I used to manage group
(1:52:32) homes and I go in front of them they're like "Wow a superhero i get to meet." So kids want to see something that's
(1:52:38) superhuman they don't want to see the next door neighbor or what you could see down the park at your football field stadium or something like that they want
(1:52:44) to see freaks and to push your body to this status it's like it takes [ __ ]
(1:52:50) almost losing your life to the point to where or going to some extreme it's [ __ ] hard like I can have a thousand
(1:52:57) people and not one person turn bodybuilding it's [ __ ] insane so it it takes a [ __ ] ton of [ __ ] work i
(1:53:03) would actually tell if anybody in this group chat listened to me I would say don't do [ __ ] bodybuilding do something more fun baseball basketball
(1:53:09) or something like that because bodybuilding is tough as [ __ ] it's harder than all those things put combined I think in my opinion well the
(1:53:17) funny I don't understand baseball is less fun than that but there there's something I've always um you bring up a courier's point
(1:53:24) because people always uh they always mention like the the steroids and um all
(1:53:30) the the uh the juicing and oh are you natty and stuff and like I always wonder like how like like is this is it like
(1:53:36) legal now like because they're always it's so common now like everyone it's
(1:53:41) not It's not legal like let's say if I got a shipment to my door if I got a shipment to my door police can pick it
(1:53:47) up and then they can like do the undercover thing and they can legit take me in and arrest me it's not legal but
(1:53:53) the only way it is legal is like for right now I'm having TRT a doctor can say well and and here's the thing though
(1:53:59) I'll be honest with you about my health um if you take testosterone or anything like this you could say well people can
(1:54:05) say well cuz I have an argument against this too they could say well you're taking illegal substances it's not natural well what does your body produce
(1:54:11) it produces copious amounts of testosterone from like 13 to to maybe even 20 right your body's legit
(1:54:17) producing a steroid in your body you're not putting anything that's foreign the only thing foreign about it is that it's
(1:54:23) synthetic it's a synthetic version of something your body already produces right the problem with this is is if you
(1:54:28) start taking testosterone in copious amounts at a young age your body then becomes dependent on it and stops
(1:54:33) producing its own which case it happened to me now do you see grown adults that are on TRT like myself they have to take
(1:54:39) it because we've wrecked our own [ __ ] production so I have an anti- uh drug approach to this if anybody starts they
(1:54:46) should do it like me and not take anything and [ __ ] win a show naturally before and do all this so it's
(1:54:53) not na it's not legal per se unless you can get it from a doctor so well it's
(1:54:58) not even that complicated like whenever somebody challenges that sport I just tell them like "Hey try eating 5,000
(1:55:04) 6,000 calories a day for a week and let's see how you do." They usually That's actually the toughest part of the
(1:55:09) sport is is actually fixing that dealing with that plate that's it they can't even handle that bro they can't even
(1:55:16) handle that and um Marcus I actually have a question so like someone who's like I used to be a bit Wait guys i'm so
(1:55:22) sorry but I need to go to bed thank you for coming you guys can go to Uncle Tom's place naan is like Naan is like
(1:55:29) I'm not it's not exciting anymore i'm just going to end the space now
(1:55:34) i don't know what Marte did to you Naan i don't know what Marte did to you but I don't think he deserves it i'm just Hey we'll we'll we'll actually continue the
(1:55:41) space in the next space some other time because I got to bounce so and I know Nan probably has to go to sleep so if
(1:55:47) you guys have any questions we can start a space on bodybuilding and I can be an open book on questions and training and all that other [ __ ] i don't mind i'm
(1:55:54) going to be an open book raw and real and unfiltered on all this [ __ ] if you guys want to know all the secrets and
(1:55:59) [ __ ] like that in the industry I'll tell you
