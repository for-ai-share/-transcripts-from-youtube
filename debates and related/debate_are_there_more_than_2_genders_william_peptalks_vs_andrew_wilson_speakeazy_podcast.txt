(11:47) Newark New Jersey is where our next debate conference debate con 5 is happening starting on February
(11:53) 5th all right good evening everybody thank you for the your patience there we're going to get right to it I'm your
(11:59) host Ryan and tonight we're going to be debating are there more than two genders and to get us started we have pep talks
(12:04) so thank you so much for your debut on modern day debate pep talks and the floor is all yours hey thank you for
(12:10) having me I really appreciate it um also shout out to Andrew for helping me take care of my little problem here um I am
(12:16) Pepto I am a political streamer um I have more leftist views than uh some
(12:23) care to share with me but I am very open to other people's opinions um especially
(12:28) on my channel I try to uh engage in the best faith that I possibly can and I
(12:35) kind of I'm a little too uh nice sometimes uh for my own good with my Chatters um my main Chatters are
(12:43) obviously you know they're awesome but uh realistically uh let's see trans
(12:50) issues are pretty much my my main uh issue as far as if you come into my chat
(12:55) and you think you know trans rights are not human rights I just kind of go yeah
(13:00) I really don't want to engage past that much further but um outside of these kind of debates
(13:07) obviously um and yeah that's really it man and uh I yeah 420 friendly that's what I
(13:16) could say so sorry my brain is cooked Co so I appreciate the uh welcome no worries we might do better when we get
(13:22) to the uh open discussion because we did just have all that uh all that teeking
(13:27) uh but yes big thank you to to Andrew for uh helping us through that it uh is much better to be able to see the
(13:33) speakers so uh going to hand over the rest of the time to will so you have up to 10 minutes on the floor thanks for
(13:41) share my share my screen sure
(13:46) thing all right and that is up and running so I'll start the timer right
(13:53) now how much time do I have 10 minutes uh you have 10 minutes yes really we're
(13:58) there okay all right so are there more than two genders my answer is obviously
(14:03) yes and spoiler alert gender is a spectrum let's go ahead and get
(14:09) started so first the first thing I want to address is that gender and sex is
(14:16) extremely easy to oversimplify because we really want to make the world simple
(14:21) so we easily understand it but some things in the world are not as simple as we want them to be and gender and sex
(14:27) are one of those things um gender and these characteristics that people have is much more nuanced and complex than
(14:34) just pick one of two options so the graphic I have on the screen here is a
(14:39) very effective tool to understand the complexity and Nuance of gender and sex and how they relate to people so there's
(14:46) three different options on this three different categories on the screen and we're going to go through each one so the first one is gender identity gender
(14:53) identity the most important part about it is that is purely psychological gender identity is something that exists
(14:59) in the mind of the individual and it is the person's inner opinion about thems
(15:05) it is their opinion and their opinion about thems could be more on the woman's side more on the man's side on both
(15:11) sides as androgynous or on neither sides or on something completely different there is no wrong answer when they
(15:17) choose one because it is a personal opinion about how they identify themselves and that's simple enough for
(15:24) gender identity gender expression is in fact the outward expression and manifestation of a specific kind of
(15:32) gender and this can include things like how they dress What accessories they have the way they talk the way they
(15:39) their mannerisms and and others and the a key Point here is that gender
(15:44) expression does not need to match gender identity they don't have to have the same one you can have masculine women
(15:50) and vice versa and then we have anatomical sex anatomical sex is the
(15:55) physical characteristics of the person and those physical characteristics are
(16:01) usually associated with a sex those physical characteristics can include things like genital structure and
(16:07) chromosomes and hormonal makeup and bone structure and these are not binary
(16:12) either they are also on a spectrum you can have more female physical characteristics or male or both or
(16:19) neither or something completely different there is no one anatomical sex
(16:25) now where there does come in rigid rules is sex assigned at Birth you don't have
(16:30) a lot of options here you got three you got female male or interex and this is where transgenderism comes into play
(16:37) transgenderism well first let's talk about the dsm5 the dsm5 is the diagnostic and statistical Manual of
(16:43) mental disorders and it is the gold standard of psychological medicine in
(16:49) modern day so it's very reliable resource here and the dsm5 recognizes
(16:55) transgenderism as a person who has gender dysphoria and gender dysphoria is
(17:01) when an individual's sex assigned at Birth does not match their gender identity that's all it is and the dsm5
(17:09) does not recognize gender dysphoria as a mental disorder or a mental illness right it is
(17:17) just a psychological characteristic of an individual now that being said there are
(17:24) times where gender dysphoria can cause stress and and can cause
(17:30) uncomfortableness in the individual and when we face that situation we need to
(17:36) look at these individuals as what they are and they are people in our society
(17:41) members of our community and they deserve being members of our community they deserve respect and empathy and
(17:48) support when they need it right so the question is how do we support a
(17:54) transgender person when they're going through a stressful situation related to
(17:59) their to their transgenderism on the screen I have six individual articles all upto-date um
(18:06) modern articles that are peer- reviewed that all are pointing towards gender
(18:13) affirmation surgeries helping transgenders be more healthy mentally
(18:19) and be further away from depression and suicidal ideation and things like that
(18:25) this is evidence that gender affirming surgeries does help them it does support them and makes them stronger for it and
(18:31) we want to build people up in our society right golden rle now I know some
(18:37) people are very afraid of gender affirming surgeries for change genders
(18:42) and there's good news for those people there's actually a much more effective way to support these people and help
(18:48) them avoid suicidal ideation and depression that other method has to do with supporting them socially and
(18:56) through empathy and vocally advocating for their support and telling them that
(19:01) their opinions are valid because they it is their opinion and it's and you want
(19:06) to help them because they are valid and you want to recognize them as whose they are and that you respect them openly
(19:13) that is the number one way to help transgender individuals and in fact suicidal ideation depression isn't a
(19:20) symptom of gender dysphoria right gender dysphoria isn't what causes those things suicidal adiation and depression is the
(19:27) result of your community rejecting you that is what causes these
(19:32) mental issues in people who are transgender when your community isolate you and tells you your opinions and your
(19:39) thoughts and your feelings are wrong that is what causes the mental illness and the depression and the suicidal
(19:45) ideation that is the problem not the transgenderism themselves not the gender
(19:52) dysphoria so that's a quick summary of my of my argument um and I think uh I
(19:58) think I can wrap it up here I hope we get into um who can use the bathroom I
(20:03) hope we get into sports I who can play what sports I hope we can get into all the Gambit of different topics related
(20:10) to this and uh I think I'll wrap it up for my time here appreciate you guys all right you got it so we're gonna hand it
(20:16) over to the other side and uh have six minutes on the floor per speaker but uh if you haven't noticed the big giant
(20:24) white billboard beside me here debate con 5 is fast approaching we're only two weeks away uh as you can see featuring
(20:31) Andrew Wilson he's going to be doing two debates on that uh uh for the event I should say possibly three oo possibly
(20:39) three well yes keep uh keep an eye out for that we'll keep uh keep you guys in the loop uh it's going to be exciting
(20:44) but um yeah it sounds like you're going to be our MVP this time this going to be in new Yark New Jersey so if you haven't
(20:51) already check the link for the tickets below we are are fast selling out those tickets uh if you know that you can't
(20:57) make it but you want to help us out I do have the Indiegogo Linked In the description there uh let's see if we can
(21:03) get past that 75% and I'm going to share that in our chat and uh see if anybody
(21:08) else is willing to share that since I know some of our people are live right now I think Pep's live maybe Andrew I'm
(21:13) not sure but uh let's get going uh who would like to go first Andrew or Speak Easy six
(21:20) minutes yeah what do you think speaky do you want to go then I go uh yeah sure I got a real short one be honest yeah so
(21:28) uh just want to start off thank you to modern day debates for the opportunity I appreciate it my name is Speak Easy I go
(21:35) by Speak Easy on my channel I'm a conservative commentator a debator a musician and I run an open panel blood
(21:43) sport every Friday on my channel it's uh it's different than this but a lot of
(21:49) blood sport uh debates going on over there uh the straightforward answer to
(21:55) the prompt is no it's a completely barbaric and it doesn't make any logical sense to
(22:01) even consider more than two genders there's only two genders based off the biological facts and that are
(22:08) always uh sorry that are and always have been linked to sex and used
(22:14) interchangeably humans being classified into male and female or men and women
(22:20) categories according to their reproductive anatomy and chromosomal
(22:25) patterns uh men typically have XY chromosome while women typically have XX
(22:30) chromosomes these chromosomal distinctions are crucial for biological processes reproduction
(22:37) hormone production sex secondary sexual characteristics uh regardless of whether
(22:45) the individuals have XX or XY or there's some I know they're going to point out
(22:50) the individuals with xxy or the reverse there's only ever two paths a human
(22:56) being can form a and there's some genetic mutations I'm sure the opponents
(23:01) are going to love to bring up uh without this binary understanding of the
(23:07) definition uh the the definition of man and woman just becomes ambiguous and it
(23:12) leads to a world where these terms mean absolutely nothing like I can literally just say my opponents are women and I'm
(23:20) right in this chaotic world view they can't say no they have to say yes uh in
(23:26) modernity and historically societies all around the world predominantly only
(23:32) recognize two genders uh it's it's shaped all the legal and medical fields
(23:37) that we stand on today it's the framework and foundation for all societal organization so to wrap my part
(23:44) up to recognize only two genders is deeply rooted in biological science
(23:50) offering a clear and practical approach approach to understanding human
(23:55) identity all right you got it and uh we'll give give the other 9 and 1 half minutes over to Andrew so yeah you have
(24:02) up to 9 and a half minutes to uh make your case and uh thanks again Speak Easy for your introduction H we appreciate
(24:08) you being here as well uh but with that we'll hand it over to you Andrew thanks for coming on back to modern day debate
(24:13) you know you can always tell when it's going to probably be a spicy debate is when everybody has a very wrapped up
(24:19) tight opening statement because they just want to get at each other and get right in the meat of things I always like that right I should bloviate for 9
(24:27) minutes and waste everybody time though just to be a dick uh but I'm not but I'm not going to I'm not going to uh I will
(24:33) say to pep talks TV it does seem like uh you are paying attention trying to be good faith just remember that because we
(24:40) have a differing view than you uh that doesn't mean that we hate trans trans people or what you know what I mean
(24:47) that's not actually what that means this is uh this is the rhetoric of the Democrats that if you don't believe that
(24:54) you hate so uh my opener again very brief the they them we us Zer zers want
(25:02) us to believe the dumbest thing on earth that is that the zyper Zer is a category
(25:08) which conveys something that isn't complete gibberish you see in order to be a zizer you must simply feel as a Zer
(25:15) Zer would feel what does that feel like who knows because even if you have the exact same behavior pattern as every Zer
(25:21) Zyer on planet Earth if you identify as a they them or we us the zers or zers have to admit you are one one of the
(25:28) they thems or we Us's and not aiser per d right here is what this means it just
(25:35) means that the category of gender doesn't really tell us any information that we can follow
(25:41) coherently imagine if we had a chart like a genderbread chart uh and this
(25:46) chart had every category behavior of what is female and what is male which of course that genderbread chart couldn't
(25:51) have and it couldn't have it because you can't actually make a chart like that uh
(25:57) if but if such a thing could exist let's say theoretically um then I would I would just kind of
(26:04) like to know what would it be pointing at what's it pointing at on either end of the
(26:11) spectrum it's going to be pointing to male it's going to be pointing to female when you say there's a spectrum what's on either end of this spectrum right
(26:17) it's a binary and so what they do is they put a decimal point inside the binary and try to pretend like this
(26:23) creates some sort of spectrum where there isn't one okay imagine if we had
(26:28) this chart uh and this could exist this technically could
(26:33) exist uh it can't it can't exist and I'll explain why this gentleman who's
(26:39) you can see him doing like the destiny triangles he can't really tell you what's going to belong inside of this
(26:46) list like if a man wears a dress does that make him more of a woman he would say well well yeah sure if he feels like
(26:54) it if a man has a purse does that make him more of a woman
(26:59) well sure if he if he if he feels like that if a woman is wearing uh you know
(27:04) pants does that make her more of a man well sure if she feels like that meaning that you can have somebody who has every
(27:10) single one of these categories right and says I don't feel like that and they aren't or a person
(27:16) who has every single one of those categories and says I do feel like that and they aren't that's why it makes no
(27:22) sense it's complete gibberish imagine uh for instance they say trans rights right he uh pep talks
(27:29) TV says trans rights aren't human rights when somebody says that it makes pep talks upset but Ry why you're talking
(27:36) about a a fictitious category not people so like your opponents aren't talking to you about a category that they believe
(27:43) is even real when we say so this is where you live in what's called equivocation right you both of you live
(27:49) in equivocation because you believe that this categorization is real you say that that's a proper human category and we
(27:55) just basically say but wait that's not a proper human category we still see these people as human we
(28:01) just don't see that category as being valid that's where the great equivocation comes in uh they say gender
(28:08) is a spectrum uh gender and sex is an oversimplification or shouldn't be an oversimplification that's what the
(28:14) genderbread which by the way they don't even use the genderbread anymore because it's outdated and here's some of the reasons why it's
(28:21) outdated he says an oversimplification or can't be an oversimplification remember inside the Nuance what he
(28:26) really is claiming here is that it's just a feeling gender is a feeling
(28:31) that's it what but then he goes on to say but it's very nuanced and complex well no the [ __ ] it isn't it's just how
(28:38) I feel now but if you say that it opens you up to all sorts of ridicule right
(28:44) for instance if I say oh well I don't feel I don't feel that you're that thing you feel like you are why am I wrong
(28:52) well because I don't feel like you should feel like I shouldn't feel that way right it leaves you open into all
(28:58) sorts of criticisms that uh that make zero sense right uh they say a a
(29:04) person's inner opinion about themselves is what he says for the gender bred Theory there is no wrong answer he says
(29:11) so there can't be a wrong answer then about how I identify them that can't be wrong do you understand like if you say
(29:18) there's no wrong way remember in his opening statement quote it's a person's interfering
(29:25) opinion about themselves there's no wrong answer then there can't be a wrong answer about
(29:31) how I feel about their identity do you understand it's the same
(29:37) thing gender doesn't have to match sex he says well yes it does because these
(29:44) are the two ends we're using for actually making these categorizations to begin with they say sex is a spectrum
(29:51) but then he goes on and he makes a massive mistake and this is one of the reasons why the genderbread theory should be thrown out he says that
(29:58) there's three Sexes no there isn't there's no and he'll never find a credible scientific Source anywhere that
(30:05) I ever call interx a third sex that's Insanity there is no third sex interex
(30:10) isn't aex it refers to variations into sex that and it isn't a sex category in
(30:16) and of itself it never has been it's never been classified as one and it still isn't it's an umbrella term like
(30:24) for instance men who have their testicles shrivel due to to external condition can be considered interex
(30:29) they're still men right they you can't say it's a third sex and by the way that would bring up all sorts of problems for
(30:35) you if you even thought thought that right could the third sex only breed with the third sex can the third sex
(30:41) breed with both of the other Sexes who can the third sex have kids with can the third sex oh you know what I mean like
(30:48) that makes no sense they would still fall under a sex binary category for
(30:53) reproduction that's why it can't be a third sex classification that is the stupidest [ __ ] thing that I've heard
(30:59) in weeks postulated by Will who didn't take 5 Seconds to look into whether or
(31:05) not interex was a sex I want credible scientific
(31:10) biological classifications for interex which make it an actual third sex because to my knowledge there's OVA and
(31:19) there is uh sperm meaning there's small gametes and there's large GTS that's it
(31:25) if is there like a medium Gam is there a medium gamet somewhere in there that we could classify as the third sexual G
(31:32) that's like what the [ __ ] are you talking about will uh by the way this is why they stopped using that gender bred
(31:39) man in mainstream trans apologetics you've been you must have be like out of date by a couple of years on your trans
(31:46) apologia will because they don't even use this anymore bro because of these
(31:51) various problems you should get like the gender bred man 3.0 update version for
(31:56) Trans trans apology so just pointing that out uh with that I do think it is
(32:02) important to be completely Fair these guys haven't been [ __ ] yet we're not going to be [ __ ] to them yet as long as they stay not being [ __ ] but I do
(32:09) think it's fair if they want to move outside even the domain of this debate of are there only two genders and get into things like transports and and
(32:15) things like this but we better clear up some of this stuff first to just make sure we're not even talking past each
(32:21) other because when somebody says there's a third sex that to me sounds like the equivalent of aliens just landed on
(32:28) planet Earth I mean that is real serious breaking [ __ ] news ladies and gentlemen that is something which is
(32:34) like an outlandishly crazy claim to say there's a third human sex and I can't wait to
(32:41) hear all about it so with that I will yield my time over appreciate it all
(32:47) right one minute left on the floor so we'll end the timer there we're going to go into an open discussion uh but do
(32:52) want to remind the audience who's watching right now if you haven't had an opportunity to uh you know cuz it's very
(32:58) difficult smash the like button you know it's just waiting for you I also put up a poll in the live chat uh you know are
(33:04) there more than two genders so let's see where that's at 17 to 83 right now for
(33:11) no so 83% on the no side so keep your votes coming in let us know what you think about our debate topic tonight and
(33:18) uh yeah also uh we are going to do super chats at the end so if you want to ask a question to one of our speakers like
(33:24) many of the people have already put it into a Super Chat and we will ask them out at the end of the debate uh with
(33:29) that I'm going to set a 15-minute timer and I'll check in with you guys as long as things are moving along cogently I'm
(33:36) going to hand it back over to pep talks to respond to some of what you just heard and uh also will and then uh feel
(33:42) free to jump in there Andrew and Speak Easy well can I can I just ask an opening clarifier right to will will who
(33:49) can a third sex who can the third sex reproduce with like who can it because I would think that if you say the sex can
(33:56) reproduce with the opposite sex then that infers a binary so who can the third sex have sex with and have
(34:03) kids all right so appreciate the question so intersex is a term that is
(34:10) used to describe someone whose sexual and reproductive autonomy does not fit into the typical definitions of female
(34:16) or manale that is what interex means yeah that's an umbrella term it's not a third sex though that is what if you don't want to called a sex no no no I
(34:23) want no you called it a third sex I want to know how perhaps you didn't like the way I used that term that's fine how do
(34:29) you use that term or means something other than sex that's not male or
(34:34) female it it means your genitalia or your chromosomes do not match what you typically associate with male or female
(34:41) that's what it means yeah so so a deformity would be intersect if you want
(34:46) to call it a deformity I'm not going to like if you were born if you were born
(34:52) okay so if a horse kicks you in the balls and rips off your penis in your balls are you now a third sex or not
(34:58) will well that depends on what you want to Define sex as what the [ __ ] do you mean it depends I mean if you were in
(35:04) game if you were in Game of Thrones technically technically they did I do want to let pep in here as well
(35:12) so over to you pep just say it again the ones that had their dick and
(35:17) balls ripped off as like a third sex like what they call uh God I forgot what they call them a unic a unic yeah yeah
(35:23) but techically thir is not a third sex so kind of putting think about it it's putting them
(35:30) in their own category at that point and it's like it's not its own category it's now a man it's now a man who has lost
(35:37) his penis and balls yeah but he says it himself that he doesn't consider himself a man anymore in that way they don't say
(35:44) that they don't consider themselves men anymore no he did he did the spider did and
(35:50) youan hang on listen will one second let us have our exchange I promise we can get we can get back into it but um I'm
(35:57) not going to interrupt you with your cross talk with Speak Easy either so um just real quick on this do you agree
(36:03) with me pep talks that if a dude gets kicked in the balls by a horse and it rips off his penis and his balls he does
(36:09) not become a third sex no I don't agree with that that's I mean that's thing agree with it if well no what I'm saying
(36:15) is I don't agree that they all auto that automatically makes them a third sex I think that not having your dick and
(36:22) balls that doesn't mean anything so what makes you a third sex uh well
(36:28) have like her mafic tendon uh stuff do is that not classified as a third sex
(36:35) nope no not even chimeras no not even Chim I'm not so let me so so I'll
(36:41) explain hang on hang on I'll explain it to you well it's not Obsession to just know what the [ __ ] you're talking about when you take a position on something
(36:47) fair enough fair enough so even even when it comes to like chimerism or or um
(36:54) uh you know things like this uh it is true that this would be ambiguous but you only have two with Developmental
(37:00) Pathways reproductive Pathways only two and let me explain how I know that that's true because nobody on planet
(37:06) Earth can impregnate themselves if you had two viable reproductive Pathways you could impregnate yourself and nobody I
(37:12) heard a story about this when I was like years old and there's there's all sorts hang on there's all sorts of tales out there about people who possibly could
(37:20) have or things like this it can't be done you cannot have because because the human body only has so much space for so
(37:26) many organs and you only have two reproductive Pathways you can go down only one of the two is ever going to be viable that's why sex is a binary it has
(37:33) to be wa so I'll answer answer hold on let's let
(37:39) Andrew put a bow on have let them respond as well so so really simple okay
(37:45) there's only two Developmental Pathways for sex there's no third pathway for sex if there was I would agree with you if
(37:51) there was a third developmental pathway for sex I would say there could be three Sexes but because there's only two
(37:56) developmental Pathways there can only be two Sexes you can have ambiguity inside of those two Deval Pathways and I keeps
(38:03) saying like thinking you know well they're I mean you can only you can only ever only ever impregnate the opposite
(38:12) sex you can't ever impregnate somebody who's not that yeah but goes into basic
(38:17) sex and gender thing so again this is based on like the like identity part of it where it's kind of like see I'm all
(38:24) about I just respecting people whatever they want to be called like I go back to when I was like in kindergarten and the
(38:30) first time that somebody said hi my name's Timmy and I didn't call them Jimmy you know kind of thing I'm just
(38:37) it's kind of a simple respect issue yeah but you can't okay okay and I think that's fair to say but it's it's unfair
(38:43) to say um well I'm here to to talk about the identity basis of this which is fine
(38:49) but then don't make claims about sex don't make claims about there being a third sex like again this is where I I
(38:55) wasn't trying to like be bad faith in my joke I was actually being kind of a little serious you guys are more focused
(39:01) on this way more than like any leftist content creators I could tell you that [ __ ] give me a break you would no you
(39:07) may you may de Desy demon m i mean dude I can literally name so
(39:14) many you're using three people that have literally been ostracized by the leftist community they haven't been ostracized
(39:20) by the leftist community Destiny was your [ __ ] rockar until he until he didd the wrong p and sent out the wrong
(39:26) video he was your [ __ ] rockar last just one second there guys let's uh
(39:33) wheel it back in So Speak Easy you were trying to jump in there uh on the point so go oh no it's just when he said about
(39:39) like oh I just want to respect people so like if people want you to call them master or King you're gonna do this too
(39:44) is that what you're saying no no dude it's not very respectful why don't you respect call me
(39:51) King baby rest of the debate I would like to call me hold on hold on actually if that's your name Speak Easy then
(39:57) maybe I mean I have met some people that have some weird ass
(40:02) names I want you to call me master all right hold on hold on I'll I'll say this I'll just tell I'll just ask you at that
(40:08) point just because I want to be consistent in my values I'll just be like all right show me your legal ID that now says that your name is master I
(40:14) will call you master no it's it's my identity it's my identity show me on your identity where it says Zer ah see I
(40:21) thought I did you that's where I was muted no I always thought the Zer stuff was always ridiculous and I thought it
(40:26) was like that's how they want to be identified bro that's how they want to be identified yeah but it's nothing that is ever really brought up like outside
(40:33) of these little debates I got to be complet like dude I'm coming from a perspective of Liv experiences like I
(40:39) have a lot of like I have one friend specifically that is one of my best friends I'm literally going through this
(40:45) with her where I see the hate I see the blatant hatred and I see how she's treated differently I see exactly what
(40:52) she's worried about right now and it's not fair man like I don't like second class cry that's why second class
(40:59) citizenry like if you let me ask you this like if if if you said to me listen
(41:05) affirm I'm the queen of France or I'm gonna I'm going to kill myself right should I affirm that you're the queen of
(41:13) France how how convicted is this person they're very convicted well I mean does
(41:19) it hurt you to say it can you answer my question without asking me one well I mean I'm no then because honestly no
(41:28) why because it costs you nothing to say that to save somebody's life so you
(41:33) should affirm the delusion of somebody re affirm the untr save their life yeah
(41:39) absolutely so hang on so in this case would you roll out a red carpet put a robe on them every
(41:45) morning why do you think that's what's happening see you guys do this can you answer can you answer my question
(41:51) William I'll let you take over after no no William let's not let you take over we're done with our inquir talking and
(41:57) he's handing it over to me okay got it so so we can't Andre Andrew Andrew so it
(42:02) is not a I'm sorry I can't answer any of your questions I'm going have to turn it over to gender is I'm
(42:11) sorry call please I'm not I can't answer any of your questions speaky has to take
(42:16) over unfortunately yeah all right so gender is purely psychological gendra is
(42:22) purely psychological is something that exists in the mind it is not a delusion it is an opinion it is just as real as
(42:28) your favorite color and you can be wrong about your favorite color right okay what's a delusion a delusion is
(42:34) something that doesn't exist that you believe does exist now your opinions wait wait that's what you just said you
(42:40) wait your opinions opinions exist okay so if it's your opinion you're the queen of France it's true Queens are real
(42:47) measurable constructs in how do you measure a queen it's an it is a inter subjective aspect of our society we know
(42:54) what that's not telling me how you measure what a queen is how okay you know what a queen is I'm not going to explain to you what queen is no I need
(42:59) you to explain to me what is a specifically an identity something that stop running away in your mind you're
(43:06) running just hold on point a title back and forth a queen is a title how do you
(43:12) objectively measure what a queen is OB objectively you don't because it's an inter subjective reality it's an inter
(43:17) subjective reality that we all agree upon it is very different than a gender identity it is very different than a
(43:23) gender identity we don't we don't always all agree about what gender identity we don't always all agree on what a queen
(43:29) is that's why it's inter subjective yes right so then this would also be inter subjective yes yeah it's part so then
(43:37) you just defeated your own argument that makes no sense you inter subjectivity is something that you cannot me steal man
(43:42) I'll steal man it I'll steal man it so you know I don't get it wrong he says ladies and gentlemen the reason that this is different than if you affirm
(43:48) that you're a queen is first he says because you can measure it right I say you can how do you measure what a queen
(43:53) is he says well you can't because it's in subjective and I say well wait a second this also sounds inner subjective he
(43:59) says no it's not then 5 seconds later says no you're right it is in subjective can't be measured either so it's just an
(44:04) affirming opinion so when he says it's not delusional he would have to admit because it's inter subjective that if
(44:11) you claimed you were a queen that wasn't delusional okay why would that be delus a gender no so a gender identity is
(44:17) about your own perception about yourself it cannot be wrong like I'm a queen be wrong why am I not a queen well you can
(44:23) believe you're a queen that's what makes it wrong it it's not wrong because you're not using the legal just real
(44:30) quick I want to ask do you like tell hang on hang on do you understand that that then you're giving me the same
(44:35) criteria twice and saying one is a delusion one is not but not the threshold breaker for what makes one the
(44:40) delusion and one not one is so hold on an inter subjective reality is something we all
(44:46) agree upon that we have an existence we don't all agree on inter subjective reality or wouldn't be inter
(44:51) subjective no it it can be inter subjective and us all agree upon it yeah it can be inter objective and we all
(44:57) agree but you said be inter subjective means we all agree that's not the case right right okay okay the main
(45:05) point I'm making is gender identity is the way you app the way you think about yourself on the inside that is real that
(45:11) is your identity that is how you feel right yeah I'm a queen that's how I feel okay you can feel that way it doesn't
(45:17) mean you have the power of a queen okay well wait a wait a second what would make that a delusion
(45:23) though doesn't mean you are a woman because you feel like a woman let Define a queen right a queen is someone who has
(45:29) power a queen is someone who rules over no you could be a queen the Emperor Napoleon was in Alba had no power he was
(45:35) still an emperor he Napoleon from France yeah Napoleon bonapart he had a lot of power
(45:41) he didn't have any power when he was in Exile on an island okay he wasn't a wasn't yes you can have Kings you can
(45:48) also have Kings who have no power who are prisoners you can have Kings who have no power who are just born and have no power how can somebody who's a
(45:54) crowned King is just born have power how do they exercise power sir this is a silly argument no what's silly
(46:00) about what's silly about it if que Kings have power the fact that you're trying to stretch the argument to genetics is
(46:07) is really how much am I the king of my house dude you're no you're just going off your own argument because you're
(46:12) making up you're so far off base yeah you're trying to make an ass that's an assertion here's my argument when
(46:18) literally you're off if I say that I'm the queen if I say I'm a queen you say that's delusional I want the metrics for
(46:24) what what makes that delusional but if I identify as a sex that I'm not that's not no I'm serious do you think that
(46:29) when kids say they're Spider-Man that they're delusional no like seriously no then
(46:35) what is your problem queen queen has a welled imination
(46:41) right jump off the roof I wouldn't tell the kid yeah you're Spider-Man but they're wrong I would I would tell the
(46:47) kid they're wrong Queen is a defined term that has specific attributes right
(46:53) it has to do with either if you really want to bring it down to genetics then but the attributes can be whatever you want them to be because Inter
(47:00) subjective that's true but in our in our in our world in our definition we have all agreed upon General we haven't all
(47:06) agreed about Queen yeah okay so you don't know what a queen is I don't know
(47:12) what you call a queen and what why why I could be one if I wanted to you can't think of what a queen is what any
(47:18) attribute a queen has you can't do that what does that have to do with anything that's the difference I can
(47:24) think of all sorts of attributes a woman has and that's how you could tell you're not one that's no no no no a a queen
(47:30) that's the same argument bro que Queens have physical rule yeah so so do females
(47:36) yeah that's correct females also have in fact I would say there's more agreement on what a woman is than what a queen
(47:42) is inter subjectively a an identity is how you think about yourself a queen is
(47:48) not something you think about yourself because Queens have physical manifestations in reality other than just it being in your mind right Queen
(47:54) is not a identity that you have in your mind neither is your sex that's not just an identity you have in your mind so do any
(48:01) identities just exist in your mind Andrew are they just constructs of the mind yes some okay so they can exist but
(48:10) that's not what's in dispute yeah of course it is that's disp what's in dispute is what makes a what makes an
(48:15) identity delusional or not no no no but we agree that some identities can exist
(48:20) solely in the mind and not in the physical world around us right yeah I would say that there's all sorts of things we could identify or classify
(48:26) things is called gender identity but what makes a thing which you classify as an identity in your mind delusional what
(48:34) would make it that it's not delusional it's your I didn't ask you what is delusional I said what would make a
(48:40) thing in your mind a delusion okay it's when you believe something that that
(48:45) doesn't correspond with reality yes okay great you if you're a
(48:51) male and you claim that you're a woman and the way that I categorized these
(48:57) things along with the rest of most of humanity inter subjectively is that a woman means adult female then you have
(49:03) just refuted your own argument sir because what you're stating what you're stating is very simply that hey this
(49:10) doesn't correspond with reality if indeed you hang on if I grant your
(49:15) argument though you still destroy it and here's how because even if I grant that what you're saying is true then that
(49:20) would mean that a queen then does correspond with reality just as much as gender does as long as it's your own
(49:28) self-identification no queen queen has physical manifestations outside of their own mental so does woman so does woman
(49:35) incorrect when you're talking about the context when you're talking about the context of a gender identity you're incorrect if you're talking about the
(49:41) context of a gender expression you might be more on the correct side of things and if you're talking about anatomical
(49:47) sex then you are very much well well help me out here then uh I'm sorry what's what's a gender expression
(49:52) pointing at a cultural exception of a certain type of gender and that type of
(49:59) gender is utilizing the attributes of one of two Sexes is that right no it's
(50:05) not no it doesn't have to correspond with a sex no then how do we know whether or not or uh which is male or
(50:11) which are female attribute it's a cultural accepted feeling it's a cultural accepted opinion it's an what
(50:17) are those cultures pointing at though an inter subjective reality yeah but what are they pointing at they're pointing at man and woman right like if you P like
(50:24) if if you play with dolls right the stereotyp and that's considered that's considered feminine right it is okay and
(50:30) so when I say it's considered feminine what am I pointing at the inter subjective reality that what I'm
(50:36) pointing at the behavior this sex has it is inter subjective reality that you're pointing at an inter subjective reality
(50:42) that we have constructed as a society that's what you're pointing at's stereotypical not what's in dispute why
(50:47) are you arguing things we're not disputing here let me explain what's in dispute what's in dispute here is just
(50:53) this G I'm I'm going to concede a whole bunch of your points because are relevant okay so let's get through the
(50:59) concessions very quickly first so that we can get back to the topic I will concede the point that inter subjective
(51:05) realities not only are possible but happen all the time there's no doubt about it what we're talking about is
(51:11) what makes one delusional an inter subjective reality it can't just be agreement because if that's the case
(51:17) then the only thing that makes you delusional is that most of us agree you are but you said no that's not the case
(51:23) it has to actually be something which just doesn't correspond with reality what I'm saying to you is that any of
(51:28) the things that you consider to be gender attributes or conditionals for gender are actually pointing at sex and
(51:34) that's where they get the feminine masculine portion to associate gender to begin with so we are pointing at
(51:41) something you see what I'm saying because we're pointing at those things uh that's not inter subjective now now
(51:47) we're talking about biological correspondence with reality so that's how I can make the same determination
(51:53) you can about delusion you would have to agree that's true so I think I think I see maybe some disconnection here there
(52:00) I think it' be helpful if you were more persistent on labeling what you're talking about as gender identity versus
(52:05) gender expression gender expression points to a inter subjective reality we have constructed gender identity does
(52:13) not point to an inter subjective reality so you don't have to have any expression for gender no then it's just then so
(52:20) it's just uh I am this so I am in your mind yes for gender identity so how
(52:26) would that correspond with reality gender identity does not correspond with reality outside of what is your in your
(52:32) own mind there we go outside what your own it doesn't if it doesn't correspond
(52:37) with reality exit whatever you decide in your own mind right then you've just
(52:42) determined it's a delusion it's not a delusion at all it's a psychological manif a psychological attribute of your
(52:48) mind what it's like you're it's like you're saying the me liking the color red is a delusion because yeah or it's
(52:55) my favorite color is a delusion because favorite colors don't exist in reality favorite colors don't exist you can't
(53:01) measure favorite colors point for me okay sorry you guys
(53:07) were riffing uh it might be a good idea though if you guys want to like give some final thoughts on this and then we
(53:13) can move into some of those social issues that you guys were uh discussing uh earlier such as uh uh bathrooms and
(53:20) sports so uh you guys can pick your poison but uh maybe if you want to play hard to get past this if you I can um
(53:26) this is really important you guys can keep riffing if you'd like to I'm just uh I'm just I'm just kind of Wheeling it out there for our audience but uh yeah
(53:33) you want variety let us know in the like talking while they smack that like button I have a quick question I just
(53:39) want to make sure I'm understanding what will is saying here so you're saying with my identity I could be a woman and
(53:46) still look exactly like I do right now and and you should respect me and say I'm a woman is that what you're saying
(53:52) and and I'm also a man so my gender expression is a man and I'm a woman woman so I'm a woman man yeah it's just
(53:58) a mind State your gender expression be masculine your gender expression can be
(54:03) masculine and your gender identity can be a woman that is correct you can be a masculine woman you can be a no I said I
(54:09) said you can be a masculine woman listen to what I'm saying I'm just wondering then then I I listen I'll I'll even I'll
(54:17) even for the sake of argument Grant this just to wreck this too if that is the case will if it is the case that it it's
(54:24) just an idea of a mind state and so there can't be any untruth to it it's just my mind State it's just my mind
(54:30) state of identity MH would you agree then that something like Christianity would be that as
(54:36) well yes okay and the Christian mind state is to make determinations about
(54:41) what are men and women that is our mind States part of our ethos so if that's the case hang on hang on will will hang
(54:49) on will so if that's the case will that this is just a mind State then this also
(54:55) is true Christianity is true just like this is true because of the Mind state so if that is the case and Christians
(55:02) say well you're not a woman they can't be [ __ ] wrong they can't so you can't be wrong because in
(55:09) your mind that is what you've constructed you're right just how a gender identity cannot be wrong so tell me why Christians are supposed to call
(55:16) call these people men and women if they if they can't be wrong about hold on I will step in on this one no because no
(55:23) no no Andrew hold on how come Christians Christians expect us to respect their
(55:28) religious views especially like widely in this country because it's a mind State and you got to do what we say no
(55:35) no I mean I know you're being cheeky here but no come on no I'm not being cheeky either you respect me being a Christian or I'm G to kill myself Andrew
(55:41) I don't think you understand I want I want God is don't understand respect I want God on the dollar bill or I'm going
(55:48) to kill myself I want prayer in school or I'm going to kill myself I want the affirmation of my religion or I'm going
(55:54) to [ __ ] kill myself
(55:59) your I can discuss anything can I finish my com resp while can I finish my combo
(56:05) a 2v2 bud yeah I know and can we atast get that one V one part of the you've been talking like guys I'm just The
(56:12) Spectator here I do I do want to give them a chance to have there back and forth I'm sorry to put you on mute their will it's just too much cross talk so I
(56:18) do want Andrew to have a chance to engage with what pep had asked there just CU pep hasn't had a lot of time on
(56:23) the no actually I did I did I do mean that though because I came from religion and I can tell you right now in my
(56:28) religion in in the Evangelical sect that I came from we definitely pressed like dude missionaries all of it it was the
(56:35) entire mission was about going and converting people and it was because we viewed them as oh you're Sinners you're
(56:41) not saved so we were putting our belief system on them I turned around and said okay that's that's just inherently wrong
(56:48) so I understand kind of where you're coming from like if this was being shoved down your throat the way that you claim it is it just is well hang on pep
(56:56) let me let me respond I'm going to pass it over Speak Easy Will's right me and him had most of the engagement I agree with that um so but the thing is the
(57:03) thing is bro it's like this is really simple just think about what you've actually stated here you said if
(57:09) somebody said that they were a queen and he didn't believe them right you would still treat him as a queen right because
(57:17) if you didn't they'd kill themselves that's what pep talk said no it is you can rewind the tape will bet do you want
(57:22) to bet me 100 CLI it all you want dude but standing on a bridge saying that they're
(57:28) going to off themselves and I just happen to be walking by and they're just like call me the Queen of England now
(57:34) but and they literally they have like well even worse then they they have a gun to their so then what you're saying hang on pet talks then what you're
(57:40) saying is this if there's a school right or where 13 Christian kids all put guns
(57:46) to their head and say we want prayer in school or else are you going to do it pep talks are you going to are you going to give them prayer in school well I
(57:52) can't give them prayer in school you're asking me you're asking me something no hold on and this is the [ __ ]
(57:58) argument that I'm going to call out real quick like you just did there is you pivoted to something that's so unrealistic in a from a situation that
(58:05) is totally realistic you can totally you can run into somebody that
(58:12) is going through something like that and then you can just make a capitulation even if it is you know giving into their
(58:19) delusion at that time I don't care what it is if it's saving their that one person's life at that time I don't see
(58:25) the problem with that okay so then here's the thing first of all a hypothetical doesn't need to be realistic it only needs to all
(58:32) understand that you're playing it bro I didn't interrupt you just let you talk sorry you're right so the idea here is
(58:37) if it is the case that 13 Christian students said prayer in the school or
(58:42) else and you are the unilateral dictator of the United States are they gonna get if I have that kind of power then yeah
(58:48) sure they can SCH school no but all schools no all schools yeah great or
(58:54) good buddy bye oh so so then you would they would all go for the greater
(59:00) good so then I got to ask you something if more than half of the world's well
(59:05) actually is far more 70% of the world's population is religious in I'm engaging in this yeah if 70% of the world's
(59:12) population is religious right then if by your very harm definition there that it
(59:17) causes them harm by affirming this then you shouldn't actually push for it because you're causing harm do you
(59:23) understand that okay okay I kind of get where you're going with that but no I I
(59:29) disagree entirely on based on I disagree that the harm is being done uh By Us
(59:35) propagating like their identity I don't think that like them wanting to be
(59:40) identified as something else is actually causing any harm yeah but what if what if 70% of the planet right followed a
(59:48) various like or let's just say uh you know roughly 4 billion people or 5 billion or six billion people followed a
(59:55) certain set of religious ethical values and part of that identity which you affirm is a legitimate identity is to
(1:00:03) not call these people by these preferred pronouns there's very few of these people who demand to be called by the
(1:00:08) preferred pronouns you would actually be affecting billions of people based on the few and when I test your logic the
(1:00:15) other direction and say well what if this few was going to un alive themselves who happen to be Christians you'd say for the greater good we would
(1:00:22) have to let them do it so tell me something sir in the reverse why would it not be the case that that Christians
(1:00:29) and Muslims and things like this shouldn't say well for the greater good if you're GNA alive yourself all
(1:00:36) right Andrew why is it lying to call use their pronouns why is it lying uh well whether it objectively is lying or not
(1:00:43) you would have to agree with me that the idea from from the idea from Christians
(1:00:50) and Muslims Etc is that it is yeah why whether or not whether or not it is or not it's irrelevant
(1:00:56) think it's lying why tell me why that's relevant because it's not lying and I can explain to you why it's not and you
(1:01:02) might be convinced yeah but what who are you arguing at that point what are you arguing I'm arguing what's the point of the
(1:01:08) principle of the argument let's just say I'm wrong and I just believe it's lying so what I I can tell you why it's not
(1:01:15) why does it matter even if you were because it wouldn't be Haring you if you're even if you proved it to me if I
(1:01:20) still believe it's a lie it doesn't matter I'm trying to convince you it's not a lie it's nice I'm not here to be
(1:01:26) convinced whether it's lie or truth I'm here I'm here to make the determination of whether or not it's a greater harm or
(1:01:34) lesser harm if this many people believe it's a lie and you're concerned about the harm it's going to bring to
(1:01:39) Christians you're you're concerned about the harm it's going to bring to Christians chrans Muslims too whatever they're they're going to lie and that
(1:01:44) would harm them because they're they are going to be lying in their brain right yeah I can talk to you and tell you why
(1:01:50) you're not lying so you would not be harming this person how would that contend with the argument though Haring
(1:01:57) you're just assuming that you can convince all these people what if you can't yeah like it that doesn't contend
(1:02:02) with the argument perfect that is that is that is a that is a next step in the
(1:02:07) argument like to explain just for the purpose of good faith here we go you ready I'll show you
(1:02:15) I grant your argument just grant for the sake of argument I grant it that I was wrong now can you contend with my
(1:02:21) argument then then now you agree it's not harming yourself to by using their pronoun doesn't matter it doesn't
(1:02:26) contend with my argument no but your whole argument is it's harming you so you shouldn't use people's no no no it
(1:02:31) didn't it's not me it didn't say me specifically The Entity which is Andrew Wilson so even if I grant this even if I
(1:02:38) were to just grant it for the sake of granting it it does not contend with the argument would you please contend with the argument please will I I'm I guess
(1:02:46) I'm Ling what you're arguing my AR part here's my argument right uh there's way
(1:02:51) way way way way way way way way more religious people on plan planet Earth then there are uh people who are trans
(1:02:59) who want to be called by certain pronouns because that is the case if all of those people are if you're asking
(1:03:05) every single one of them to respect and affirm a thing they believe is a lie whether it is or not will they just
(1:03:10) believe it is they just believe it is will then can you show me how it is that
(1:03:17) under the harm threshold those people aren't being more harmed they believe it's a lie because they don't understand what gender identity is who cares that's
(1:03:24) the if they it matter why that's not how the whole
(1:03:29) princip works let's give will it wouldn't matter Ry said I had the floor we're
(1:03:37) we're gon to just give him a chance sorry put you on I believe the topic of this debate is is there two genders not
(1:03:42) does everyone think there's two genders not what's everyone's opinion on if there's two G is there two genders in
(1:03:47) reality not in the mindset of certain religious based off your argument that's what matters is if everyone thinks
(1:03:53) that's what absolutely not that is not what I said if you listen to any of my argument you listen to any of my
(1:03:59) argument gender identity exists in here in your mind it doesn't matter if anyone agrees with you or disagrees with you it
(1:04:05) exists here and you cannot take that away from me you cannot take that away from anybody but why can you take away
(1:04:11) from me how I feel about yours I'm I'm not taking away from you at all you can
(1:04:17) believe anything you want about me because actually to your point speaky I think you would have a problem if somebody tried to do that to you though
(1:04:23) wouldn't you we do they're called transp people are trying to do it right now you can't take someone's identity away it's
(1:04:29) imposs theying matter what you do you cannot take someone's identity away you can force them to change their gender
(1:04:34) expression that would be horri that'd be horribly that would be horribly inate you can force them to align with what
(1:04:40) atomical sex they like and that's also very in unkind but you can't take away their gender identity that's untake away
(1:04:47) can you take away their religion no you can do it in your bedroom okay so so here's the thing so
(1:04:53) here's the thing if this is a category of the Mind yes is lying a category of the mind oh my
(1:04:59) God can you get to your point is lying a category of the mind it's an interesting
(1:05:07) question no okay an interesting question that makes it sound like he's got the
(1:05:12) one up in this debate but it's has nothing to do with this so it's not well actually no it does and I'll tie it in
(1:05:17) in just a few seconds and and and you're going to feel dumb even though you should feel dumb anyway because you
(1:05:23) haven't made a cohesion point but anyway what makes it not a category of the mind
(1:05:28) because you can say things that are false objectively okay but objective means uh
(1:05:33) not dependent on mind yeah yeah so that's why I said it's not a feature of the mind okay so so
(1:05:42) when you say lie you're saying that there's objective truth there's truth which is not mind
(1:05:47) dependent yeah there's subjective truth how would you determine that objective truth option of mind you don't know
(1:05:53) what's objective truth so so so you couldn't determine what is objective truth no but you can tell what's more
(1:05:58) likely so then that wouldn't be objective thoughs aren't objective no no well they
(1:06:06) they are if you're saying objective would mean mind independent so statistics would be subjects are mind
(1:06:12) independent Andrew they are yes they don't need to be interpreted by a mind
(1:06:17) statistics are statistics they exist independent of Minds how math exists
(1:06:22) independent of Minds right does logic does logic exist independent of Minds no that's different well what I'm sorry I'm
(1:06:29) sorry isn't isn't logic a mathematical expression no mathematical expressions are a subcategory of logic right and Ma
(1:06:38) math math quantities exist independent of humans right so if quantities exist
(1:06:45) then you can then things can be grouped together without a human being there to
(1:06:50) group them together right so math is mind independent but not logic
(1:06:56) you changed my mind Mind Math is mind dependent okay math is mind dependent yes I'll give you it oh okay so so then
(1:07:05) how do you know what's objectively true then because of measurements that are
(1:07:10) external but that's that's that would be independent of mind yeah that's you just said math is
(1:07:18) mind dependent that would be subjective wait measurements doesn't mean math did
(1:07:24) you how do you measure something without math you ever heard of a ruler what do a
(1:07:30) ruler use numbers aren't math numbers isn't two plus two numbers is counting
(1:07:35) right there's a different wa wait I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry are numbers of representation used mathematically to
(1:07:40) express something numbers numbers are measuring a distance isn't the same as calculating
(1:07:47) a distance right those are two different concepts how do you measure something without math sir dud I feel like we need
(1:07:53) way more joints in this for this convers I'm I'm Ser now I'm seriously conf how do you measure a thing without
(1:08:00) math you measure math bro I think I think a child can count without understanding math right yeah but that's
(1:08:07) they're not doing math ex they're not measuring something perfect perfect what are they you count You Can Count without
(1:08:13) needing to understand math you can count the number of apples
(1:08:19) on my table wait no you're not can't no no no you can't count the number of apples on
(1:08:24) the table right unless that's dependent on a mind
(1:08:30) right yeah okay so then when we're talking about mind independent concept subjectivity you think truth itself is
(1:08:36) sub do you think vegetables actually have an objective wait hang on here here's why
(1:08:42) this for real though Andrew I'm gonna answer the question let's finish our engagement real quick the reason that this is so important is because if you
(1:08:48) say these are all categories of the Mind including lying right that you can't even say that Christians are lying like
(1:08:55) couldn't even say that they were lying or that trans were telling the truth because these are just subjective categories based on your internal like
(1:09:01) your internal mindset like there's no objective real objective truth anyway right so so fundamentally speaking
(1:09:08) Andrew if we really want to fundamentally question the reality of the universe yeah we could be in The Matrix I'm not trying to do that though
(1:09:15) that's not what I'm trying to do exactly what you're doing I'm not even trying to get into meta ethics I'm just trying to say no it is if it is the case that well
(1:09:22) then you're then the meta ethics are starting with you by saying because it's a State it's true you would be the one
(1:09:27) making the first meta ethical claim not me so if that's or metaphysical claim that that would be you you would be
(1:09:32) getting into the meta first not me so all what you're saying is this is true that's a truth claim right so if that's
(1:09:39) the case is it subjective are lies a product of the mind or are they not uh
(1:09:45) lies are product of the mind yes but okay well then you can't say that we're li My response you let me you gave me go
(1:09:51) ahead go ahead go ahead okay okay so does objective truth exist yes are we going to be able to comprehend it with
(1:09:57) absolute certainty no those are two different categories so although I can be very confident about something is
(1:10:03) true can I say it's true with 100% certainty no does that help like truth AP you mean I don't know what that is
(1:10:10) truth like not that it is you can't you can't make the determination that something's 100% true or 100% false but
(1:10:17) it's truth apt like true enough maybe something like that right that's not exactly what truth app means but but
(1:10:23) like close enough for what it is you're trying to Express I would like to jum what what I'm trying to say is just this right and I'll finish I'll finish it
(1:10:30) here so that you can move it move it along and I'll let you respond to it what I'm saying is is that if it is the case that you just believe Christianity
(1:10:36) is a mind State and you believe transness whatever that is or gender is just a mind State and you agree both are
(1:10:42) equally True by that categorization which you've agreed both are equally true if lies are dependent on the same
(1:10:48) mind which grants that these things are true these can't be lies these people can't be telling lies they can't be
(1:10:53) telling a lie because based on their own mind state it has to be true I agree
(1:10:58) with you on that well then what the [ __ ] then from the harm principle side I would have to be right because we just
(1:11:04) significantly outnumbered trans people bro so they would be doing more more of you so there's more no to yes more more
(1:11:13) yes I would say the harm is part less all right let's let's try to push into one of the social topics there fellas uh
(1:11:19) you know I could flip a coin on it but let's just uh I'm going to hand it over to Speak Easy he said objectively the least floor time here so without
(1:11:25) interruption I'm going to hand it over to speak easy to uh talk about some of the social uh subjects that we usually
(1:11:31) get into such as the bathrooms the sports issues stuff like that and uh see if we uh can unpack a little bit there
(1:11:37) so go ahead when you're ready to Speak Easy well like this just touches on what
(1:11:42) I I said with my with my opening statement is that the binary of gender has literally formed everything with
(1:11:50) legal with medicine with sports like th this is the there's no again if if we
(1:11:58) have an ambiguous definition of uh gender we can just allow anyone like
(1:12:04) they want to do put anyone into sports so why should anyone even have to take the certain hrts and all these uh or why
(1:12:11) should a man have to take um the HRT for a certain amount of time before he goes
(1:12:17) into the women's sports why don't we just make every sport neutral that way and just have dudes boxing out women all
(1:12:23) the time like is that what you want to see is that the world you want to live in like I I all right so why do you want
(1:12:30) to divide Sports up by gender it's because of fairness I'm not even going to exp that you want it to be fair right
(1:12:36) the thing is gender is not going to always tell you what is or is not fair
(1:12:41) in a sport right if you want to gauge fairness there are better metrics to use other than gender right there are some
(1:12:48) adult women who are much stronger than me much faster than me I can kick my ass in some sports and that's not fair right
(1:12:53) they're they're better than me but they're woman so it's disagreeing with your mind with with your Paradigm right
(1:12:59) if you want Fair Sports there are other metrics that can you that you can use that are better apt to gauge fairness
(1:13:06) such as strength that can be measured speed that can be measured even skill could be measured muscle mass BMI
(1:13:13) there's many metrics that can be measured that can better suit a fairness fairness in sport than just gender
(1:13:19) gender is a non consistent way to G can I just ask a single question very briefly please if men only compete with
(1:13:25) men and women with women how's it unfair it's unfair because some Not all
(1:13:30) men are equal to each other and not all women are equal to each other it's not not fair always right so the what you're
(1:13:38) saying is that Sports themselves the idea of sports themselves isn't fair to begin with fundamentally they can never
(1:13:44) be perfectly Fair the goal is to make it more fair but if I challenge mikeful Phelps and swimming that's not a fair
(1:13:50) match just because we're both men he's physically way more adapt to than I am
(1:13:56) not fair just because we're both men yeah but this the point of sports is to compete right yes and you want it as Fair as possible that's why you have to
(1:14:02) use met what would be a more what would be a more fair system strength you can measure strength speed you can measure
(1:14:09) speed you can measure BMI you can measure skill level even in certain Sports these are metrics that are much
(1:14:14) more apt for fairness in a sport that you can gauge is this person fairly
(1:14:20) gauging against this person that is the best way to measure fairness right okay so here's here's what do on this
(1:14:25) particular argument I'm going to seed a bunch of ground to you again in this case um though I'm not even going to
(1:14:31) destroy you like I did last time I seated this time I'm just going to seed the ground and say uh me I'm perfectly
(1:14:38) happy with women beating the absolute [ __ ] out or men beating the absolute [ __ ] out of women in all categorizations
(1:14:45) of women's sports like I'm totally fine with that I'm content with it I don't care if they kick their faces in I don't care if they beat their brains out I
(1:14:51) don't give a [ __ ] if they throw them into walls I don't care if they [ __ ] I don't care what they do to like my so my idea is here's what I'll say my
(1:14:58) counter is the reason you always see it's the mtfs who want to do all the competing and not the FTM especially in
(1:15:06) contact Sports there's basically none uh is because of this reason because
(1:15:11) obviously the mtfs feel like they have a statistic a a an advantage right and
(1:15:17) often they do and so the thing is is like because of that I find it to be that men are invading women's sports and
(1:15:24) I'm totally fine with that right I'm not fine with that what do you mean you're not fine with that you're not fine with
(1:15:30) it NBA is a gender neutral sport I don't know if you know that right the reason they made a woman's NBA is because no
(1:15:37) women could compete right so like this is like this is what Andrew saying I don't understand why he's not fine with
(1:15:43) that why aren't you fine with that are pretty boring anyway so let's just make sure we take them all out by putting them in with the men did you just get
(1:15:50) Bugs Bunny boy I said duck season you said rabbit season then we just reversed it now you're arguing that being women sports bro so so I maybe I
(1:15:58) was not representing what I thought when I said that what I meant was I'm not fair I'm not okay with unfair Sports I
(1:16:05) want Sports to be fair and using gender as a distinguishing fact because that makes Sports fun no I think it makes way
(1:16:11) more fun when they're not fair well that's cuz you're a sa this um but wait I'm sorry wait a second wait a second
(1:16:16) when you go and you watch somebody get completely brutalized in a sport you
(1:16:21) think that that shit's not fun for people it's fun for one team people have a
(1:16:27) weird Tendencies towards yeah so what do you mean of course it's more fun but it's at a certain point it's not
(1:16:34) fun right it's it's unpleasant to experience true cruelty is not fun for me personally but in in I want a sport
(1:16:41) that's fair I want a sports where two people are evenly matched and gender is not the way to address that and I don't
(1:16:47) know if you heard what I was saying speaky but there's better metrics that can be used to gauge fairness other than
(1:16:52) gender that's the point I'm making yeah those metrics you we already do these in certain Sports yeah we should throw out
(1:17:00) gender then using those we keep the certain weight classes of men together
(1:17:05) yeah we do example again all you're all you're going to do is just eliminate all women from Sports and it'll be a bunch
(1:17:11) of you know the only women in your worldview that you'll see in sports as dudes wearing dresses not at all
(1:17:17) speaking in all have plenty of women who could compete any much better and much
(1:17:22) more fair actually because
(1:17:28) honestly he's missing the point that there's inter murals there you guys are also missing that there could be other
(1:17:34) leagues that could be developed through this like dude I've played in a gay uh men's hockey league I'm not gay myself
(1:17:41) they needed a backup goenda in Chicago actually I kind of
(1:17:46) notice your background there um that's you not recognize the Sears
(1:17:51) Tower why don't you guys let the lesbians play with y'all they they do it's it's coed I was just getting to
(1:17:58) that oh you didn't say that you said the thing is outside of the coed
(1:18:03) outside of playing for the game the gay men's hockey league which is all coed all these other I can tell you right now
(1:18:10) every other men's league pretty much in the entire tri-state area of Chicago also has women on their hockey
(1:18:16) teams and I can also tell you that most of them are certifiably badass so it's not a men's hockey league then if has
(1:18:22) women it's considered men's hockey it's literally called men's hockey leag look my my listen my position on this like I
(1:18:28) don't even know why speak is just going to freak out over that I don't even know why speak you don't even need to to to
(1:18:34) fight him on it the truth is is that uh the feminist fought for 75 straight
(1:18:40) years in order to have their own sports divisions and sports leagues and prove that they were just as good as the men
(1:18:46) and all of this [ __ ] now the radical turfs the uh trans exclusionary [ __ ] feminists are out here saying hey hey
(1:18:54) you can't have M our sport I think it's [ __ ] great I love the fact that they're getting their [ __ ] brains bashed in because they vote for this
(1:19:00) [ __ ] I don't give a [ __ ] like I say more men and women sports more [ __ ] men and women sports do it now do it fast as
(1:19:08) many of them as want to go in that's fine that's my actual position what's the problem here sadistic so Speak Easy
(1:19:15) can I explain to you why they would not eliminate all women out of sports if you did approach this way no let me explain
(1:19:22) I agree where it would make Sports you know all fun instead of you know you have to wait for the women's sports
(1:19:28) channel part you know so let's say you instead of using gender as the metric of fairness women UFC fights are boring I
(1:19:36) always those oh my God all right just one second jump in here I'll kill you your mic there Andrew as well go ahead
(1:19:43) will instead of using gender as the metric to distinguish what is and isn't a fair fight you instead use strength
(1:19:49) right and if a woman comes in and they have AEL myself Ryan sorry I'm sorry he just he just said something I was just
(1:19:55) responding I'm I'm actually muting myself oh yeah no worries I if I I was just hitting the unmute just so that uh
(1:20:00) when you're ready to come off mute it's available just because I I took away the uh ability to unmute oneself I can undo
(1:20:07) that though because you guys uh you guys are doing quite well yeah I'm just trying not to interrupt as these guys are doing their their back and forth no
(1:20:13) worries all right all right so if someone comes into the sport and they have a low-level strength they do not
(1:20:18) have to depend on their gender to hope they're going to be matched with a fair person because instead you could be
(1:20:24) matched with someone with a similar level strength right there are some women who have very low level strength and they could be matched with women who
(1:20:29) have lowle strength or men who have low level strength in fact it would be more inclusive more people would have opportunities because it would make
(1:20:36) things more fair you could have weaker people join Sports when they wouldn't have before because they're only divided
(1:20:41) by gender that is a much less Fair metric to use to gauge fairness it would be more inclusive more people could join
(1:20:47) in have fun it'd be a more better system overall yeah like I don't care about it
(1:20:54) being Fair amongst the men again I like watching I like watching the the better
(1:21:00) fighter take out the less better fighter like I don't well then we can bring back the Coliseum if you just want to have
(1:21:06) people kill each other like that's not how modern sports are tackled modern sports is about competition and about
(1:21:11) who's better than the other one and about who trained better than the other one it's about trying to be the best you
(1:21:16) can be about getting they should let they should let the UFC fighters do steroids too so that they can really
(1:21:22) [ __ ] give us that is an irrelevant that's not even close to what we're talking about well I mean wouldn't it be more fair if I mean like what is even
(1:21:30) the objection to steroids in sports if all of them take steroids that's more fair it's an IR it's not relevant to the
(1:21:36) thing we're talking about if you want points steroids are not that's I'm explaining to I don't care about the the
(1:21:42) fair part where you're you're making it so let's let let's make the hold ony
(1:21:48) hold on Speak Easy the rightwing the main rightwing talking points are though that's the that's the problem there you
(1:21:55) may not be making if if you don't care about fairness then why do you want to separate Sports based on
(1:22:00) gender again I prefer not to watch the the men beat up the women but as to
(1:22:06) Andrew's point this would just eliminate women's sports in general and that would be probably better do you think what I'm
(1:22:12) describing would eliminate women 100% but you could still have the whole reason we made a second B league and all
(1:22:19) these other leagues is so that women could have their own leagues to play in but women could still participate sure
(1:22:24) I'm with it bro but women could still participate in the system that I'm describing right speak they can try sure
(1:22:31) no they no no it's not try you would actually be more competitive they would have better competition because they would have people closer to their match
(1:22:37) level rather than just oh you're a woman being the woman you have this opinion
(1:22:42) and my opinion is they would just get eliminated from Sports and and we have proof to show that that's what happens
(1:22:49) when you don't allow a different League between men and women we we have proof that this is what happens can't get in
(1:22:55) but why would why can't they get in Speak Easy why please explain because they can't compete with men why can't they compete why can't they compete
(1:23:02) Speak Easy why can't they compete Speak Easy men are better at sports okay so
(1:23:09) it's a skill level differently right it's about strength no all different types of things there's strength there's
(1:23:15) twitch muscles there's the way their hips are formed live right now mass is
(1:23:20) that that's perfect are you live Speak Easy yes okay sorry guys can unmute yourselves Again by the way so just let
(1:23:27) you guys know okay so those things you just described speakz mass muscle strength speed all those things those
(1:23:32) are metrics that can be used to gauge better fairer fights right if you really
(1:23:39) want Fair fights then that's the reason you're dividing it by gender you can do that without talking about gender you
(1:23:44) can do that with the actual attributes themselves and that would make a much more productive competitive environment
(1:23:50) for everybody again my reason to divide it by gender right is with my moral world viiew is men
(1:23:59) beating up women would be pretty bad but if it's going to eliminate women's
(1:24:04) sports I'm I'm kind of for it not a serious person I well I don't
(1:24:10) understand why that's an unserious position it seems like our enemies are destroying themselves so if the idea here is that uh radical feminists are
(1:24:18) becoming trans exclusionary because and literally they're called trans exclusionary radical feminists I say ret
(1:24:24) Ed feminist uh I think that the reasoning that we would have of the enemy of my enemy is destroying itself
(1:24:30) what's the problem here why does that make us not serious people well let me let me try to track what you're saying so you are happy you're destroying
(1:24:37) feminists is that the idea you want them to die is that it die why did you why did you make the die you like them being
(1:24:44) beat up in matches I'm trying to understand you said you like them getting beaten up to like really bad can
(1:24:51) be correlated with death if you consent to um to the idea that men can be women
(1:24:58) you can't then make the argument that you can't compete in your sports teams bro do Have you listened to what I've
(1:25:03) been saying I'm not saying that yeah I know but they're saying that they're saying that they're saying not only did
(1:25:09) we vote I'm not defending them why are you defending understand but this is what our argument is about when when I
(1:25:14) say irrelevant when it's not irrelevant because you just asked why should we take you seriously if this is your belief and I'm giving you the
(1:25:21) rationalization for it so you can be upset about that but the rationalization is fine the rationalization is just
(1:25:27) these women vote and have pushed for Trans ideology you cannot make both the
(1:25:33) dualistic claim that men can be women but if they are women you're affirming they're women they can't compete in
(1:25:39) women's sports or you're saying they're not women you agree with me right so I really appreciate you arguing against a
(1:25:46) argument that I did not make and I'm not going to defend that because said he's not a serious person yes because he
(1:25:53) likes getting women beat that's why though what's the rationale behind it though I there's no real rationale I'm
(1:26:00) going to I just gave you the [ __ ] rationale bro can you repeat it to me that you like them suffering their own
(1:26:05) the consequences that they s and what's wrong with that what's the pro no the argument is that if you a say say men
(1:26:12) can be women and then B when they they declare they are women you cannot then exclude them from things which are women
(1:26:19) otherwise you contradict yourself that makes no sense so our rationale on this is consistent
(1:26:25) their rationale is not consistent so again I I will say what I've been continu to say that is not my stance I
(1:26:31) don't believe there should be gendered separated Sports I think Common Ground fantastic yeah and
(1:26:39) the reason is is because you create a contradiction uh if you say that men can
(1:26:44) be women but they cannot compete in women's sports that creates a contradiction and you have to St the consequences of your own contradiction
(1:26:51) I'm not arguing against something I didn't argue for I'm giving you our position that's not an argument that's a
(1:26:59) [ __ ] position I gave you my position as well yeah so I think we can move past this we're heavily in agreement here let them go in let them kick the [ __ ] out of
(1:27:05) them I don't care I don't think that so I'm gonna head it back over to speak easy then and we can discuss the other
(1:27:12) uh Hot Topic uh hot button topic that usually comes up in these debates since we didn't get to uh discuss it too much
(1:27:18) which is uh usually the bathroom so uh you know if you guys got something else that you think is more pressing right
(1:27:23) now you know feel free to uh to correct me but I think that's still something that
(1:27:29) a lot of people are talking about so uh go ahead there Speak Easy when you're ready yeah sorry uh it cut out a minute
(1:27:37) did you say the the the bathroom bathroom what you said yes that was what
(1:27:42) was brought up in the intro so we uh if you want to go down into that Avenue I I'll give you the floor to intro us up
(1:27:49) queue us up and then uh we can get into it for a little bit um my timer did go
(1:27:54) off uh for the 50 minutes so if you guys want to maybe give that one about 10 minutes and then we can move into Q&A if
(1:28:01) that sounds good by y'all I'm here to be as long as possible
(1:28:06) sorry guys I'm here for the long game sick break yeah yeah I I have I have enough time or whatever yeah okay well
(1:28:13) then let's let's do 15 minutes then and then we'll go to Q&A so yeah if you're hanging out in the live chat right now make sure uh once again that you poke
(1:28:21) the like button uh you know it really helps boost us up in the algorithm and also on top of that uh yeah we are going
(1:28:27) to take Q&A in a few seconds here so not a few seconds sry 15 minutes we're going to do it uh the Q&A so if you have
(1:28:34) questions for any of the speakers on screen right now get them into a question are you feeling all right over
(1:28:39) there Pap um surving I not feeling good p no dude I am struggling D I think he
(1:28:47) said he has Co before I got real bad man that's well you're a trooper for coming
(1:28:52) out to modern day debate we appre apprciate you still holding to the obligations that we set while you were
(1:28:58) still sick but no this has been good you guys have had a good discussion so yeah we're going to hit uh this new topic for
(1:29:04) about 15 and then get into the Q&A so once again if you're watching live right now get those questions in and um yeah
(1:29:11) I'll hand it over to you speak easy uh so is the is the argument from
(1:29:19) the other side just simply we should can I frame the question so
(1:29:24) what is why is it dangerous to have men in women's bathroom why is that dangerous by
(1:29:30) itself why is it dangerous yeah well uh if you're just
(1:29:36) going to say inherently obviously you can't just say any action is inherently dangerous but you open the Avenues to a
(1:29:44) lot of potential risks when you're like what involing pardon like what dude dude
(1:29:50) he's answering you in good faith what's this [ __ ] like let him answer
(1:29:55) yeah it's uh simply I I like I'm saying you're opening the risks to when you
(1:30:02) involve um people in or sorry two different genders in the same washroom
(1:30:08) you're you're you're opening the risks to Predators uh pedos a lot of different
(1:30:14) Avenues you're going down when you allow this in society plus you normalize the
(1:30:20) sexualization between the the genders to the public for no reason so is it the
(1:30:26) concerning because men are more likely to be involved in sexual violence is
(1:30:32) that the concern no the concern the so let me here well I'll let you finish
(1:30:37) your inquiry but then I have a question for you go ahead I'm sorry I didn't mean to cut in go
(1:30:42) ahead yeah I I didn't say that though that's a so I don't know where you well I'm just saying you you're saying it's
(1:30:49) opening up doors to sexual issues P pedophilia and violence and things like that why do you think men being in a
(1:30:55) woman's bathroom is going to open those doors well are you only talking about men's and women's bathrooms or women and
(1:31:02) men I mean usually that's the that usually that's the steel man I'm trying to make if if you want to talk about something else so you only want to allow
(1:31:08) men's and women's bathrooms is that just to be clear that's Che no usually the
(1:31:13) argument against trans being in the bathroom is you don't want to have the right but I gave you my argument so I
(1:31:19) don't care what you well here's here let me ask you a question will yes why why are there stalls in
(1:31:25) bathrooms uh for privacy oh but but I I don't understand if we didn't have
(1:31:31) stalls in bathroom so single stalls bro stop stop wait wait wait wait no sing
(1:31:36) stop can you stop can you stop for 5 seconds so I can that single stalls yeah so so if you have a stalls in bathroom
(1:31:43) if we eliminate the Stalls how does that increase danger for people how do that elim it doesn't make it more dangerous
(1:31:50) it doesn't uncomfortable yeah it just makes it uncomfortable m so we this is
(1:31:55) the same exact argument right so the thing is is that if we eliminated all of the Stalls you shouldn't actually have a
(1:32:01) problem with that I mean so so I want people to feel comfortable right and I
(1:32:07) want people to feel comfortable in the back and they don't feel comfortable if somebody's not their sex going into their bathroom that's the end of the
(1:32:13) argument right that's it go ahead calm down calm down go ahead go ahead bro so so you may not feel comfortable with that but there are other people who will
(1:32:20) feel comfortable with it right and there are some okay can I share my screen real quick go ahead all right yep sure thing
(1:32:27) all right I am ready when you are where's the share
(1:32:32) button will say when I go out and play shows I do appreciate having a private
(1:32:40) stall who doesn't like that right all right so if we want to talk about Comfort level do you think women
(1:32:47) generally would be comfortable with having the people on the left side of the screen in the women's bathroom do you think women generally would feel
(1:32:53) comfortable with these people in the bathroom probably not you're about to tell me that they're trans right obviously I am and then the people on
(1:32:59) the right side of the screen do you think they would feel comfortable in the men's bathroom where men can look at them be near them you know this whole
(1:33:07) ideology right they would obviously not feel comfortable either the goal is for people to feel comfortable can you can I
(1:33:12) can I ask you just very quickly I've seen this argument a hundred times before uh just a very uh brief uh
(1:33:18) question do you think that most trans people when they're affirming their gender look look like this that these
(1:33:24) are exceptions oh that is irrelevant okay can you answer my question are these exceptions to how most trans
(1:33:30) people actually look exceptions it's an irrelevant Point can you answer my question please they except what do you
(1:33:36) mean people all look well because I'll explain I'll explain hang on I'll explain the entire argument so the
(1:33:41) argument that you're trying to make is because there's a few exceptional cases of where the ambiguity is such that
(1:33:48) these people look so much like men you're saying essentially really ugly women should be able to use the men's room that's what your actual argument is
(1:33:55) my argument back to you is that these exceptions these are exceptional cases of ambiguity when it comes to sex and if
(1:34:02) it is the case that most people don't follow this then by your own metric you would be increasing discomfort even if
(1:34:08) these very few exceptions who by the way are so exceptionally looking that they
(1:34:14) could use these bathrooms without anybody ever bothering them anyway why would you need to change policy that
(1:34:19) makes no sense well the thing is for these people to follow the law they would have to use
(1:34:26) pull this down now by the way we don't we don't still need it up okay sure for these people to follow the law they
(1:34:32) would need to use the bathroom that would make people in the bathroom possibly uncomfortable so for me to
(1:34:38) follow the law I can't take a piss off the side of the highway either so whole purpose is to make people comfortable if you want to make people comfortable be
(1:34:44) consistent with your argument then this this it this I have the most consistent argument you have the least consistent so I'll explain so it's against the law
(1:34:50) for me to pull off on a roadway and take leak I do it all the time I don't give a [ __ ] and going to say we still do it
(1:34:56) don't we and you and you don't give a [ __ ] either you do it all the time and he doesn't give a [ __ ] and he doesn't give a [ __ ] all of you [ __ ] have done
(1:35:01) it you don't [ __ ] care if you got a pee bad enough you're gonna get off the roadway you're gonna take a Le yeah okay okay but you don't care you
(1:35:07) just ignore them if you take a few exceptional cases of gender ambiguity all you're saying is really [ __ ] ugly
(1:35:12) people where you cannot tell the difference which are Rarity right uh can can you use whatever bathroom they want
(1:35:18) but they already can because nobody can [ __ ] tell but because the vast majority of cases you can tell you can
(1:35:25) for instance I can give you a similar set piece that you just gave me of like oh I don't know the health secretary the
(1:35:31) former Biden Health SEC secretary there's no ambiguity there we know that that's a dude so the thing is is like if
(1:35:38) you wanted maximum comfort you would base it on the maximum of the cases and the maximum of the cases is that you can
(1:35:43) tell so them using the bathroom which is associated with their sex would actually increase maximum comfort that is the
(1:35:50) argument you fail at your own logic not me right stop trumping yourself up
(1:35:57) so by your definition even by your definition you said I could say I'm a
(1:36:02) woman so I would be able to go in those washrooms too you understand what you're saying right so you would increase the
(1:36:09) uncomfortability right the goal of a comfortable bathroom is to be in an
(1:36:14) environment where you feel safe is that an agree do we all agree with that and safeness doesn't depend on if someone is
(1:36:21) ugly or yucky or gross I do I do dis is the concern but I think you would even
(1:36:27) agree with me in my dispute here so I know I know that this is kind of petty semantic but I think it's important for
(1:36:32) clarity I don't think that pure comfort in a bathroom stall has to just do with
(1:36:38) safety I think it also has to do with like things like judgment uh things you know things like that that you can have
(1:36:44) uncomfortability even if it's not because you feel unsafe we've all been at we've all been at the stall where
(1:36:50) we're the only one in there and another guy walks in and he walks to the one right next to us it's happened to all of us that makes my that makes my point so
(1:36:58) I I I don't know why you even said that but anyway the point is here making your point a little clearer yeah but I mean
(1:37:03) nobody nobody will nobody was unclear about it but
(1:37:08) anyway yeah the point the point I forgot that you're the only one that can make jokes here got it well just funny ones
(1:37:15) so the point here is zing it was good the point here being before I was so
(1:37:20) rudely interrupted by our by our socially ambiguous friend over there uh is that I don't actually understand how
(1:37:26) this would increase Comfort if all you can do is point to the exceptions to the rule and say these people who already
(1:37:32) could use the bathrooms of their choice nobody would ever dispute it because they couldn't tell the difference anyway uh somehow we need to now let all the
(1:37:39) people the vast majority of which you can tell the difference now go into the various bathrooms that increases the
(1:37:46) uncomfort level it doesn't increase it so can you explain that to me all right so I think it's very important to try to
(1:37:52) unify comfort and safety into one cohesive unit right that is the most
(1:37:57) important part safety I re that you might not like being next to another man who's really figuratively in a way you
(1:38:04) don't appreciate you feel like they're yucky or something even though they're a man that would make you uncomfortable
(1:38:09) but that doesn't mean they get to use a separate bathroom for ugly people that is not your argument you're making right
(1:38:14) that doesn't make any sense no I'm giving you the extension of your of of your logic you're just saying that really ugly people who are so ambiguous
(1:38:20) you can't tell that their sex would be able to right this second use the bathroom of their choice cuz nobody know
(1:38:26) the difference if it were in fact the case as you say that nobody can tell the difference between these people being
(1:38:31) male or female then there's no problem anyway it's only if people could tell that they become uncomfortable the fact
(1:38:38) of the matter is is that you can tell the vast major hang on the vast majority of times you can tell so so by your
(1:38:45) assessment of uncomfortable you would increase discomfort not decrease it I I
(1:38:51) think you're advocating for Trans going into trans to women's bathrooms Andrew
(1:38:56) can you explain how because you just said these these men these men who identify as men and were born as women
(1:39:03) would be socially looked upon as men and if they're socially looked upon as men
(1:39:09) then they should be using the men's bathroom no well wait a second so you're conflating two different things it's not
(1:39:14) that they're socially looked upon as men it's that you can be fooled or tricked in at a glance you could think one thing
(1:39:21) which is true which is not true that doesn't mean that it's socially acceptable it just means that if it is the case that it's so ambiguous as to
(1:39:29) not be able to draw distinction they should already be able to use the bathroom of their choice anyway you do
(1:39:34) you think use the men's bathroom or women's bathroom if it is the case that
(1:39:39) all of those people can already use the bathroom of their choice because nobody can tell the difference what the [ __ ] is
(1:39:46) the problem unless you're saying people where you can tell the difference can't can you expl because they're breaking
(1:39:51) the law so what what so what they're break breaking the
(1:39:57) law isn't an issue from your perspective no well what law are they breaking they're breaking gender bathroom laws
(1:40:03) yeah if nobody can tell if nobody can tell right then nobody cares no the law
(1:40:09) cares and if you ever get found out that you were using a bathroom that you weren't supposed to be using you go to go to jail Andrew do you not see that as
(1:40:15) an issue understand they're not going they're not going to go to jail one and two and two here's the other the other
(1:40:22) big problem that you have is that we don't dictate public policy on exceptions to rules we don't do that law
(1:40:28) is always a trade-off it's always going to be a trade-off for for some uh based on the many for instance I could make
(1:40:35) great Arguments for why it is you should be allowed according to the Constitution to own a bazooka however we have public
(1:40:42) policy statements where we say look we have to limit that for the purposes of social cohesion or whatever else you
(1:40:48) know other types of arguments that you want to make for this the point being is is that there's always a trade-off when
(1:40:54) it comes to law in this particular case we're not going to uplift the entire social order because there's a few
(1:41:01) people out there who are really ugly women or men who you can't tell the difference already could use the
(1:41:06) bathroom so that the vast vast majority of them where you can can use that
(1:41:12) bathroom because that actually does increase discomfort and discomfort does increase safety risk to both by the way
(1:41:18) to both would you would you advocate for more um gender neutral stalls where
(1:41:24) you're not even sharing a general bathroom with people like like a a room that no one else here mcor Place in
(1:41:31) Chicago in mccormic place in Chicago they have nothing but non-gendered bathrooms okay is and it's safe you're
(1:41:38) not uncomfortable this is the most optimal possible environment that a bathroom
(1:41:44) could be it's always funny too because there's always lines to the uh like the Stalls but the urinals are always open
(1:41:49) so right these are the kind of things that we that's that's because men are just very
(1:41:54) so so would you advocate for things like that Andrew do you think that's a but but why not because again I would not
(1:42:01) not it wouldn't maximize Comfort all it would do so at that point you would be putting an expense on both taxpayers and
(1:42:07) private business owners a massive expense they don't actually need to comply with in order to compensate a
(1:42:14) very very very tiny minority of people for no particularly good reason when you
(1:42:19) consider stop bro stop bro I'm just trying to respond let me let me respond okay I'll let you ask your question its
(1:42:25) entirety can you give me give me a chance to give me my answer in its entirety so we would not draft public
(1:42:32) policy creating expenses uh necessary expenses for people like in rural
(1:42:37) Georgia they might not have any [ __ ] trans people they're going to put in a trans neutral bathroom it's [ __ ]
(1:42:43) stupid that doesn't make any sense all that that does is put an expense on a business owner for no good reason with
(1:42:49) the potential that maybe one day there might be one somewhere that's [ __ ] DB what you could do what you could do
(1:42:55) instead is say because there's such a drastic minority of people here and if they're already that ugly at what you
(1:43:01) call passing they can already use those bathrooms all you're doing is saying we're going to maximally increase the
(1:43:08) discomfort immediately of people uh by allowing people you can tell the difference to go into their bathrooms
(1:43:13) that's stupid policy it doesn't even make sense let's let in here as well there guys I think pep hon I'm good I'm
(1:43:21) about to like I kind of feel like I'm going guys so just uh yeah make your point no worries all right go ahead
(1:43:27) There Will and Speak Easy also feel free to jump in as well I know that you've been having a chance to Stew a little
(1:43:32) bit actually maybe let's uh let's ask Speak Easy what he's thinking about what's uh what we're talking about here
(1:43:37) we still got about five minutes or so so uh Let's Speak Easy in and then uh we'll
(1:43:42) I'm sure you'll still remember where you well there there's not really much more I I can add on to this is It's again he
(1:43:50) he will is not uh saying that we want to do it for the people that are
(1:43:56) extremely passing and able to trick everyone because that nobody would say
(1:44:01) anything to begin with they wouldn't know right there's nobody that like and
(1:44:07) you this complaint about oh they would they would go to jail like fathers and mothers bring their kids into the
(1:44:14) opposite gender washroom all the time so that they don't have to go into a washroom by themselves they they bring
(1:44:19) them with them so that they can supervise what's going on nobody called the police on these parents and said yo
(1:44:25) you better take them to jail because they're bringing an opposite gender kid in the washroom like it just the
(1:44:30) difference is that that's what would go on the difference is that you want people like me that look exactly like me
(1:44:38) to be able to say I'm a woman and go into the washroom that that's it's ridiculous and you you don't have
(1:44:44) anything good for it Speak Easy why should genders why
(1:44:50) should bathrooms be separated at all you want it because it's uncomfortable you want to be comfortable right is that the
(1:44:55) core argument speaky realistically that's what this all comes down to you want to be comfortable in your bathroom right you want to feel comfortable with
(1:45:01) the people around you want that's the reason you want trans people to be able because you're saying it makes them more
(1:45:07) comfortable minority population so why you want the minority to be more
(1:45:12) comfortable than the majority of people I don't understand you're misunderstanding me speaky that is not my argument no you're about to give your
(1:45:19) argument that's going to be your argument I promise actually hold on you could apply this to disabled bathrooms if he wants to use that hold on if he
(1:45:24) wants to use that argument about minorities then we shouldn't have disabled bathrooms either then we don't
(1:45:30) there any places you don't have disabled bathrooms bro that's actually BS I can tell you right now in my city in my city
(1:45:36) it is actually what did I just say there's many places where you don't have disabled bathrooms there's many places where it's completely up to the the
(1:45:42) proprietor the owner no wheelchair ramps no no uh no bathroom for the hand cap
(1:45:48) many many places where that is the case Andrew let me ask you a question right here real quick how do you determine who
(1:45:53) uses which bathroom uh based on whether they have a vagina or a penis so trans people can
(1:46:01) use the bathroom of their choice when they have anatomical sex changes can't they Andrew well no they can use the
(1:46:07) bathroom that they're as shine to their sex birth that's a different answer yeah dude that's a different answer than you
(1:46:14) just gave man I thought you were GNA own me and all this stuff I'm sorry I don't I don't understand consistent answer
(1:46:20) wait what's what what did I say that was correct oh Please Speak Easy can you try to because you're using Des topics
(1:46:27) doesn't mean you're what did you what did I say that was incorrect all right let's break this down really simply so
(1:46:33) you really simply so you said it has to depend on the genitalia of the individual going into the bathroom
(1:46:40) that's what dictates who goes into the bathroom yeah right yeah when you have a trans when you have a gender
(1:46:45) reassignment surgery that changes the genitalia you have uh no it doesn't oh
(1:46:51) well doctors and the entire medic Community says it does so you are more intelligent doctors they don't say that
(1:46:58) fantastic they don't say it changes the genitalia so in other words all all you're doing is dis so let
(1:47:05) me let me get this right you're saying that if I chop off my arm I'm not a
(1:47:11) man oh my God can you just are you circumcised can you answer my question
(1:47:17) ridiculous question that's my point that's my point you saying that there's a dismember ing which happens does not
(1:47:24) change the categorization of man woman no but it changes your genitalia yeah but you're talking about a disfigurement
(1:47:30) not a changing of sex AR of course it's a changing of sex what is genitalia hold
(1:47:36) on better question then is circumcision like is that deforming yeah that's
(1:47:42) mutilation yeah okay not a big fan of Mutilation so Andrew what is genitalia
(1:47:47) let's really get down to this what is a penis how are you not a fan of genital
(1:47:52) mutil when you want people to yeah that's the stupidest thing I ever heard I'm not a fan of genital mutilation but
(1:47:58) kids getting their penises cut off that's that's not genital mutilation what children don't get their penises
(1:48:03) cut off that's a red herring yeah that's literally what is a penis Andrew because you said that's the thing that decides
(1:48:10) what goes into a bathroom or not what is I was being fous I was saying based on sex oh you're changing gold post no
(1:48:17) there was no gold post change I transphobic strategy so what dictates
(1:48:22) into a bathroom the sex of the person okay and you're saying the sex is how is
(1:48:28) that determined Andrew uh well generally it's determined at Birth and there's three different categorizations in which
(1:48:34) you can make sex determination you can do it based on the prod production of small gametes you can do it based around
(1:48:41) uh the genetics of an XY or XX chromosome or the Third Way when it's very ambiguous is you can use a
(1:48:46) reproductive pathway system this would include ovaries or things like this gotcha so there's multiple ways you can
(1:48:52) dent determine what someone's sex is from that yeah that's correct fantastic is
(1:48:58) there anything else you wanted to add to that yes yeah I was going to ask more questions and could a little bit if you
(1:49:04) could change all if you could change all those things uh would you be changing your sex you can't change a reproductive
(1:49:11) pathway but what if you could you can let's just let's just experiment in our brains for a second a thought experiment
(1:49:17) what if we had really fantastic technology what if you could grow a be grow wings that make Birdy I'm not
(1:49:22) talking to you Andrew what if you could change what you're talking about I so what you're talking about is the robot
(1:49:28) brain argument that's a better one you should use that one instead what if we took your brain and we put you in a
(1:49:34) female body can you address yeah whatever whatever your question is go ahead okay
(1:49:40) I guess I'm just going to make the point because I'm not really going to ask you for your factious answers so if you could at change all of those forms of
(1:49:48) identifying if someone is or is not a specific sex change somebody's sex of
(1:49:54) yes that's what I'm saying if you could change reproductive pathway the Gen which we're getting closer to and then
(1:49:59) the genitalia you would then be changing somebody's sex by your they wouldn't be the same sex I agree you wouldn't be
(1:50:05) that would be a sex change and then that person could use the different bathroom you would agree yeah so if you were able
(1:50:10) so it's a technical issue no no no no no it's not a technical issue liit of Technology it's not a limit of Technology either you are not able
(1:50:18) because sex is a binary to change a reproductive pathway it's not it's not the case there's only two viable reproductive Pathways period that's
(1:50:25) always going to be unchanging technology is not going to be able to do anything about that of course it can okay tell me how what well I'm not saying I'm going
(1:50:32) to tell you how but you can things like that with technology you can't tell take someone's DNA and make form it into a
(1:50:39) certain a certain way that it can be impregnated in a different form than you would before this is science fiction
(1:50:47) Andrew we're talking about right now we're talking about far far in the future but it is not there's aot physics
(1:50:53) there a of phys and I'll just and again I'll concede if you change the ontology
(1:50:58) meaning the very being of a person somehow you were able to intersect or interject to change a reproductive
(1:51:05) pathway from birth as an egg they actually would just be that sex then so
(1:51:10) you're just making my argument I no that I don't understand what you just said okay well let's I'll
(1:51:16) break it down for you please there's two reproductive Pathways you say Andrew if we could change the reproductive pathway
(1:51:23) would your opinion change well no because you would still it would still be the same problem you're still one of two sex's dummy do you get it now no no
(1:51:30) no no no that that you the thing is we're using your definition of sex Andrew I'm using mine
(1:51:36) too I'm using mine too I know but your definition is wrong it's the problem Oh My definition of sex is wrong thir
(1:51:44) SE psychologists who understand gender and sex much better than you agree with
(1:51:49) you yeah people who studied it for decades yeah and know it way better than you do they would never agree with you
(1:51:54) the guys who the guys who study John money the guys who study John money the exercise of what I've been doing is
(1:51:59) trying to prove logicalness in let's H into the Q&A uh it's been a

(1:55:31) if you have concerns questions complaints style and rail woodworking
(1:55:36) says the answer is no two hours saved then Bassel problem says modern day
(1:55:44) debate is a platform for misinformation and bigotry congrats you are true heroes
(1:55:51) a you had your moment okay Richie says if transgenders suicidal ideations is a
(1:55:59) symptom of the community rejecting and isolating them and not a mental illness why is the rate higher than the Jews
(1:56:07) during the Holocaust or slaves in the USA I'm not sure about the stats there
(1:56:12) but uh do you want to make uh do you want to stir your out on that one well might actually be better to move off on
(1:56:18) this one I don't know if that was an appropriate question it might be better to move off on this one for the MDD side
(1:56:24) I would just let that one you might be right I mean I thought maybe we could Pat our way around it but
(1:56:29) you know I said it I said it real sussy you know all right made by Jim Bob says if sex and gender are
(1:56:36) distinct can a biological female be a trans woman if no why
(1:56:45) not so so this is just a categorical error when you're talking I really don't
(1:56:50) like it when people use the word biolog iCal female or male because it's arbitrary right it's very much up to
(1:56:56) interpretation of what they mean by biological so is gender no I gender is very arbitrary bro
(1:57:04) come on I described to you very specifically what it was there's gender identity is expression hold on Andrew
(1:57:10) can I just say like I one thing that I like see in like your assessments here is that you really take the humanity
(1:57:16) like you actually you're great at seeing this as like whatever talking points or like having your charts or any of that
(1:57:22) but you don't I don't see you applying to this to like somebody you know that is going through something like this and
(1:57:27) you're just kind of like yeah this is kind of shitty listen I understand what you're saying here when it when it when
(1:57:33) it comes to emotion right you're saying it's not even just emotion well it is it is you're saying you know like kind of
(1:57:39) like Andrew where's the empathy but I want you to think of it from my perspective from from my vision I'm
(1:57:45) actually asking you the same question no what I'm what I'm saying is is that where's your empathy for the billions
(1:57:52) and billions more people than the ones hang on Bill yes billions billions bill
(1:57:59) with a B so you may not you may not know this but if if you just look up the population of Christianity I think it's
(1:58:04) 3.3 billion if you look up the PO population of Muslims I think it's like I I think it's pretty close to that
(1:58:10) you're talking about it's way larger I know dude okay so hang hang on hang on bro chill just chill this one I know
(1:58:17) you're wrong on I don't know I don't know why you won't chill out and just let me make the argument now maybe maybe I'm incorrect about don't do that chill
(1:58:23) out [ __ ] to me dude seriously I I'm always graceful enough to let you answer you're just never graceful enough to let me where's your
(1:58:31) empathy yeah so anyway so back to this I'm just saying that even if I'm wrong on these particular stats and I could be
(1:58:38) I could I could be totally wrong I it's irrelevant the amount of people who
(1:58:43) religiously are opposed to this versus the amount of people who demand it be affirmed is so one-dimensional it makes
(1:58:50) me think you're the moral monster that you're basically dismissing billions of people's feelings based on a few hundred
(1:58:57) people's feelings or a few thousand like do you understand that
(1:59:03) it's not disregarding it is absolutely not disregarding those feelings of those people those people's feelings are very
(1:59:08) valid just like how the people's feelings of transgenders are very valid because they are feelings and those feelings are real to the individual and
(1:59:15) gender your harm principle so then via your harm principle we have billions more than the few who make these
(1:59:22) requirements and for the billions more there's more utility in saying man woman distinction based on sex you really need
(1:59:29) to concede that point I don't know why you guys won't it makes you look so foolish so the there's a difference
(1:59:35) right gender identity is a part of the mind it's the way you perceive yourself in your own mind this is not going to
(1:59:42) infringe on anyone any human being around you's rights any human beings around you actions this does not inflict
(1:59:48) anybody to do anything if you want to call a transgender if you want want to call people by their misgenders that's
(1:59:54) your choice okay you can be a jerk if you want to yeah but that's not being a jerk I think it's being a jerk let talk
(2:00:00) Andrew jerk the other way you're allowed to misgender people well our exchanges are a little different than your and my
(2:00:06) exchanges there pept I'm allowing you're you're not being forced to do anything you don't want to do if you want to be
(2:00:12) disrespectful to people and make people feel little and make people feel worse than they really are than you are
(2:00:17) allowed to but Christianity and other religions who want to for their Dogma onto people say your gender identity is
(2:00:25) incorrect that's like saying your favorite color is incorrect the problem on everyone else consistency can
(2:00:32) you just help me out here though can you help me out here though I don't understand this yes from from the
(2:00:39) purpose of utility or harm reduction utils is going to be an an affording of
(2:00:46) xaction which has positive some type of like positive reinforcement on a society
(2:00:51) and some and I admit that this is somewhat arbitrary and you would too for the harm principle creates utils if six
(2:00:59) if six billion people believe that this is incorrect address hang on hang on stop bro let me finish the question then
(2:01:05) I I'll let I'll let you answer it you already know I will if it is the case that billions more people believe this
(2:01:11) than billions who or you know thousands who don't in this case thousands who are making the Demand versus billions who
(2:01:17) don't make the demand you have to concede its maximum utility to not give
(2:01:22) in or concede to the demand you have to okay let me tell you the distinction the reason why it's different Andrew do you
(2:01:29) think your religion is purely psychological do I personally believe
(2:01:35) that he doesn't personally believe it but we know it is I know you don't believe it's personally psychological I
(2:01:41) know you believe it's a part of reality yeah gender identity is purely psychological and transgender people
(2:01:48) understand that they understand it is something in their own mind that they used to identify thems TOS it is their
(2:01:54) own opinion abouts I don't disp that also not that but that but wait that
(2:01:59) makes my argument though discrimination so that makes my argument though but no the distinction is that you believe your
(2:02:06) religious Dogma is going to impact the world in a way that is not scientifically going to right yeah but
(2:02:13) well even if that did his relit says to accept everybody wait that's a red is
(2:02:19) that's a red hearing if you want pep talk if you want on and debate with you on religious dogma of Jesus Christ I'm
(2:02:26) happy to do it all day buddy can you explain real quick then pep talked when you call somebody a whitewashed tomb in
(2:02:32) the age of Jesus Christ is that a death sentence a white I don't know what that I haven't heard yeah you don't know [ __ ] [ __ ] just shut up so anyway back
(2:02:38) to you will very quickly um you're actually affirming you're actually affirming so you're saying that because
(2:02:44) I don't so anyway back to your no okay let's get back I get it
(2:02:50) dude I get what you're doing here and honestly like you were saying about matching energy well I'm matching yours
(2:02:56) you're being kind of a dick right now so I'm okay well so here's the thing when you make these kind of bold claims that
(2:03:02) you understand the theological position of Christians when clearly you don't I do understand when you say the affirmations
(2:03:08) Jesus like the majority of my life does Jesus Christ send people to hell no he
(2:03:15) doesn't he do actually so there's no hell no there's no Heaven There Is
(2:03:21) Heaven according to the Christian doct so everyone goes to heaven so everyone goes to heaven everyone goes to heaven
(2:03:26) that that was created afterwards Bud does everyone go to heaven uh no actually you guys all go to Purgatory
(2:03:32) until uh Jesus decides to make that wonderful day and then what happens after that we I mean according to them
(2:03:40) hold on to re according to Revelation you guys do actually go to you guys go
(2:03:45) to heaven but you guys already debate whether Revelation might have we might
(2:03:50) have to let that one go a little I was a little did did Jesus descend into Hades did he descend into Hades yeah uh
(2:03:59) Which chapter which verse I'm asking you a question did he that one I don't know don't [ __ ] know nothing so anyway so
(2:04:05) back to will very quickly Jesus say on the sermon of the mount to to actually love thy neighbor to to not have borders
(2:04:13) to pay your taxes did he did he say that he loves all thy children did you also say like if you guys do not practice
(2:04:20) what I preach and live in my way then all of us then you are a hypocrite and he has a very special place for you
(2:04:26) guys where's that oh where's that where is it where's that special
(2:04:33) place the not the not heaven Oh I thought that that didn't exist 5 seconds ago so anyway back to will real quick I
(2:04:40) I would like I'd like to I'd like to dive into this with you real quick so um
(2:04:45) I still I haven't actually heard a response to this argument talkity you're talking it has to be an entailment it
(2:04:52) has to be an entailment of M well he's giving arguments it has to be a a metric of actual utility here if you say
(2:05:00) maximum Social cohesion things like this the vast vast majority of planet Earth agrees with me that when we say gender
(2:05:06) we mean sex and there's only two Sexes the vast majority how does it give us maximum utility even if it were the case
(2:05:13) these people weren't lying they were telling the truth this and that there's so few of them to uph to upheave the
(2:05:20) entire social order based around that that's not maximum utility how could you ever demonstrate that utility is
(2:05:27) important but what's also important is important is truth right and only if it has
(2:05:33) utility I don't know I agree with that okay wait a say so if somebody shows up
(2:05:39) to your house and says where's your wife I'm going to sexually assault her would you
(2:05:45) lie yeah why I see point is oh yeah yeah I see
(2:05:52) your point I see your point I see your point I think I think it's an interesting
(2:05:58) point it's good for you to think about this [ __ ] will it's good for you to think about like I I have hope for you bro we're gonna we're gonna bring you to
(2:06:05) the duck all would I say but I I definitely think that
(2:06:11) the St Wars thank the major difference that I really want to push forward is that one is founded in reality one is
(2:06:19) not one is founded in a psychological phenomenon in the mind one is a religious Dogma that is not founded in
(2:06:26) any scientific facts at all that is a very large difference just because a lot of people think that these people are
(2:06:32) wrong that doesn't mean they're right and I would definitely go to argue that the people who are blaming okay here
(2:06:40) here's a here's a good question if those people are so harmed by me calling
(2:06:45) myself or yeah sure let's just say me calling myself a gender that's different from the sex I was assigned at Birth do
(2:06:52) you think that the harm that is being inflicted on those people is similar to the harm that they are all inflicting on
(2:06:57) me by saying my own opinion is wrong about the way I think I don't see how it how it wouldn't be the case well it I
(2:07:04) would say it's very vastly different because I have something in my mind that I am think so do they the difference is
(2:07:11) they aren't going to be harmed by me saying yeah but that's a subjective metric you this is the problem is like
(2:07:18) you keep saying control myself I just let you go through it yes the the the
(2:07:23) problem you have here is like this actually doesn't make any sense bro even from your view like just think about this objectively for a few a few minutes
(2:07:29) or a few seconds if it is the case that it's just a subjective metric for who's telling the truth who isn't telling the
(2:07:35) truth right and that perhaps both are lying or perhaps both are telling the truth I guess you know perhaps we we
(2:07:41) will never completely know but from your view I'll just say that they are it's still a relevant from a utilitarian
(2:07:46) standpoint the maximum utility here would still be in the lot it would still
(2:07:53) be in the idea of the social order being continued at not the expense of the
(2:07:58) entirety for the very very tiny minutia even rule utilitarianism would have to
(2:08:03) agree that that's true and you still have not actually refuted that you actually have not still addressed that
(2:08:11) and I think the reason you haven't bro is because you know that even if it's a lie as long as there's utility and a lie
(2:08:17) they're fine okay do you recognize that if don't ask me a question respond to the argument first please I've done that
(2:08:25) for you do that for me okay okay so you're saying the utility of believing
(2:08:30) in the way religious people believe in in gender is more utility there's more
(2:08:36) value in that for those people well no no hang on but I know you're trying in good faith I know you're trying in good
(2:08:41) faith to steal man I'll just reiterate the argument very briefly it is the case that vastly more people more people
(2:08:49) believe that that gender is interchangeable with sex they believe that when you say gender it means sex we
(2:08:54) agree on that and when they say sex they just mean a binary too and if the vast
(2:09:00) vast majority of people believe this and gain from that the maximum utility in
(2:09:05) their life with this binary if you uproot that from the or try to uproot
(2:09:12) that from the ground up in order to benefit a very few that would be massive negative utils that's what I want you to
(2:09:19) address okay I think the core disagreement here is the utility is is I
(2:09:25) think there's more utility in addressing gender the way it is in reality versus
(2:09:30) the way a religious person decides what gender is I think there it's not a reality though by your own metric it's
(2:09:35) an inter subjective thing thoughts are part of reality inter subjective reality
(2:09:42) psychology is a part of reality inter subjectively so I mean you can't avoid
(2:09:48) this right yeah yeah no sure sure but the the definitions that we use in
(2:09:54) flexible gender is more utility there's more utility in this one yeah that's an assertion I need the demonstration I'm
(2:10:00) going to going to so that is because I now have autonomy over my own thoughts
(2:10:05) that's the difference right the religious people want to make me think something that I don't think I am not
(2:10:12) forcing them to think anything that they don't want to think they can think they can think gender is a binary I'm not
(2:10:17) forcing it on them it's not true but I'm not gonna force them to do that the religious people want to force us to
(2:10:24) think a certain way about you still haven't you still haven't engaged with theity portion bro you Haven engag P the
(2:10:31) push on making me think a certain way is much strongly utility negative than me telling you I'm going to live my life a
(2:10:38) certain way and you can live your life any way you want that doesn't harm them the same can't be true if lies are okay
(2:10:44) based on utility will it can't be the case not all of equal you just said that next question coming in guys plastic
(2:10:50) stiz that was a great super chat before before we do the the next question we
(2:10:56) have to break in Speak Easy first time on modern day debate speak easyy out to you uh shot for you I know

(2:11:10) off to you sir let's go let's go you can have a shot if you want to have a shot I mean we appreciate all our speakers here
(2:11:16) at modern day debate thank you so much for Speak Easy and pep talks for being here my rule taking a hit why not oh you
(2:11:23) breaking your rule I was going to say you're like uh Craig who's going to be debating Andrew for the debate con uh I
(2:11:30) I I I I don't recall a moment where he didn't have that Vape break it my rule because it hurts guys and then he said
(2:11:37) he was micro doing I I just lost don't [ __ ] don't don't [ __ ] yourself up with it we're that you know like you don't
(2:11:43) you don't have to do that this poor guy's like cooking himself over he's like there's a lot of pressure right
(2:11:49) now little bit you know I'll give you that peer pressure all right haven't had
(2:11:54) that happen since like high school damn no worries all right so we got a couple
(2:12:00) more well quite a few super chats we'll try to get through them but uh this has been great guys and uh yeah no it's
(2:12:07) going to be it's going to be a great time at the debate con so uh as speak e he was saying he's checking out the link in the description we have our tickets
(2:12:13) there uh if you can't make it hit the notification Bell for all the events that are coming up on modern day debate they're all posted right now um and yeah
(2:12:20) if you do want want to help us out super chats are great uh they help us in the here and now but YouTube takes a lot of
(2:12:26) that so it is best if you can help us out through the Indie goo link uh and contribute to the fund there uh that
(2:12:32) would be super appreciated uh yeah let's get back to those questions thank you everybody Richie says uh yeah we read
(2:12:39) that one sorry uh made by Jim Bob all right says if made by Jim Bob he was on
(2:12:45) the other night with Craig yeah like I was just saying going to be debating against Andrew so uh we had some fun
(2:12:51) with made by Jim Bob the other night great debate go back and check it out if you have six hours to yourself if sex
(2:12:58) and gender are distinct can a biological female be a transom if not if no why
(2:13:05) not I think we might have asked this one last time I think that was the one you just read I was talking about how
(2:13:10) biological is a very arbitrary word answer it though oh my bad I continue it if you'd like but I think we're trying
(2:13:17) to push on see I didn't I I I must have read it without doing the call out because I did want to make sure that I I
(2:13:23) made a point that made by Jim Bob was on the other night and we had a lot of fun so uh I must have forgot to do my call
(2:13:28) out but did read the question you know how things go Richie says I am a white
(2:13:34) male can I identify as a black female or just a female and not black why or why
(2:13:39) not and what if I really feel like I am black all right so did you want to start
(2:13:45) us off there pep God it's the Rachel dos all I didn't think I'd have to think about her to
(2:13:52) uh you went right to Rachel doz all that's interesting I mean that's like the first one that I think of every time
(2:13:59) I think is Rachel is Rachel well hang on actually this a this a good segue is Rachel does all black huh no but but
(2:14:07) Rachel doel definitely Rachel dozel definitely thinks she's black I know so
(2:14:13) is she no no okay well then that's the end of that
(2:14:18) argument all right well you heard it there uh I think these guys had a moment of agreement so uh plastic sciss it
(2:14:25) happened look oh wow yeah and the oh my goodness isn't that crazy uh
(2:14:32) pep talk still here it's crazy h no oh hey just picking no no no this is this
(2:14:38) is an inside thing now kind of only everybody knows but I appreciate you
(2:14:44) guys bearing with me honestly man like I I was surprised I was even able to make this today so yeah wor I appreciate you being here
(2:14:51) pep you did you did fine man even the energy matching when you said I was being a dick even that was fair it was all good it was all it's all good I'm
(2:14:57) not upset you hung in there man I appreciate it oh that was that was that was that was fun honestly I see I see a
(2:15:03) great Avenue for you guys to have a conversation about the Bible in the future about maybe some things I would
(2:15:08) love nothing more I was talking to pep because he was the one that was but maybe could be
(2:15:15) another two on two it's okay bro it's okay bro they were the ones that were getting into it so anyways plastic says
(2:15:22) uh have xxy chromosomes and was born with malformed genitals of both sexes
(2:15:28) has surgery has an infant where a doctor assigned me as a male so then what am
(2:15:35) I that is a fantastic question and these are perfect because these are what my
(2:15:42) whole argument is founded upon is the fact that sex gender identity and gender
(2:15:47) expression are not are not binary right there's multiple different
(2:15:53) attributes for each one if you want to talk about chromosomes hormones um uh genitalia
(2:16:01) these are all things that add up together to paint a picture sex as a binary is just an overy simplification
(2:16:07) of looking at many many different factors that's all it is so so you're still standing by the
(2:16:15) third sex thing so I I addressed this in the beginning intersex is a label we give
(2:16:22) individuals who do not it's not a third sex though you agreed that that's true right I wouldn't use that word you did
(2:16:28) use that word though you said it's a third sex it's not that important it's the point I'm trying to make super it's
(2:16:34) super important it's absolutely not because I've already told you sex is a spectrum so to say there's a third sex
(2:16:39) isn't that crazy I said it's a spectrum so I'm not saying I didn't say it was crazy I said it's wrong it's incorrect
(2:16:46) you would not stand by that right that that was an incorrect statement look there's no harm you you notice how when
(2:16:52) I make concessions to you all the time and I make concessions for you all the time because it doesn't hurt my position it helps it in this case making this
(2:16:59) concession will it doesn't actually hurt your position it just clarifies it told I told you I wouldn't use the word third
(2:17:04) sex I I wouldn't use that and if I did use you WR and perhaps I should concede that okay yeah there we go thir sex
(2:17:10) interx it's it's a label it's the more important concept it's an umbrella term it's an umbrella term to talk about
(2:17:16) things uh with for biological ambiguity but there's no actual third sex you
(2:17:22) agree with me there right all right you're putting too much emphasis on this third sex I will EMP I will give you I
(2:17:27) would not use I would not call it a third sex okay I do want I do want to jump in here guys we got so many questions and uh pep looks like he's uh
(2:17:34) not having a great time over there here okay did you want me just to ask a few
(2:17:40) questions for you the camera close the stream go it's
(2:17:45) good bro don't feel like you run marathon here yeah no it's all good ride the Str
(2:17:51) well I was going to say I got a couple questions for you so if you want to knock him out of the park just by yourself the other fellas can just hang
(2:17:56) out uh and and listen for a few have a drink uh you know do what you like to do in your own space yeah if you want to
(2:18:03) interject you can yeah all right so let's see Vigo said question for pep talks do Souls
(2:18:08) exist do Souls exist I don't believe so no how can it be argued that somebody
(2:18:14) can be born in the wrong body without POS POS positing that a soul exists that's well kind of goes back to the
(2:18:22) original question I don't believe Soul sucess okay pep talk I just believe I believe literally like lights out gone
(2:18:30) uh that's it I I know no worries uh I'll try to push it along just uh well I mean
(2:18:36) yeah it's up to you so we'll just try to get through them there's only a few here that are specifically F keep going uh no
(2:18:41) I I need this guys I need to go no worries thank you so appreciate you being here buddy it was nice to it was
(2:18:46) nice to meet you uh and you have a great night yeah Nick had said pep talk if you
(2:18:52) don't call that person on the bridge what they demanded to be called and they jumped should you be held responsible
(2:18:57) for their death oh no although I could see the problematic aspect of somebody
(2:19:04) saw that happen and then they just saw the me and them there and they're just like I just witnessed
(2:19:09) something okay I'm gonna let will handle this one because it's to both of you and
(2:19:15) let's just see to quote Craig pep talk has impulse control issues I don't think
(2:19:20) so even Lord I don't think anybody does here I think we all do here actually this my first debate ever I think you I
(2:19:28) think you're all doing just fine uh this has been you did really good for your first debate man but I I I do want to
(2:19:34) let you know that that I did way better my first debate I just want to point that out make sure to go watch it so I can do
(2:19:40) my homework yeah that's right that's fair enough this is a skill that develops over time though I will admit
(2:19:46) knocked it out of the park already from day one yeah all right so FB says pep talk is far less moral than Andrew
(2:19:53) Andrew actually wants to help people pet talk is a spoiled brat who only cares about himself that was really of him
(2:20:00) Jesus that was really of him he doesn't believe in Hell okay uh were you an
(2:20:06) Orthodox Christian pep talks please don't act like you know Orthodox if you were not ever Orthodox I say that didn't
(2:20:13) say I was Orthodox I didn't say I was Orthodox we will close out uh pep here because yeah Pep's not feeling too well
(2:20:20) uh really apprciate was good meeting you man stay strong yeah um before I do let
(2:20:25) you go did you want to take a minute and just let everybody know well I got your link in the description so pep talks is linked in the description if you enjoy
(2:20:32) uh long streams I think you do uh I think I just checked your YouTube a little bit ago and it was like six hour
(2:20:37) streams that you're generally doing over there so if you want to take a minute my average yeah uh yeah no I uh stream from
(2:20:43) Monday uh through Friday uh four o four o'clock to usually about midnight and then um Wednesdays and Thursdays little
(2:20:51) bit more tentative and then I do uh Saturday streams so come check me out uh pep pep talks TV at YouTube and pep
(2:20:57) talks TV on Twitch all right well it was a pleasure thanks for staying and answering those questions we will see you next time pep talk I really do
(2:21:04) appreciate it guys thank you for the debate solidar brother till next time
(2:21:10) all right well we'll flick on over to this screen here so I can get things
(2:21:15) sorted out we'll keep asking those uh super chats so yes Pep top talks is gone
(2:21:20) so uh if you have questions for any of the other speakers on screen that's preferable uh just cuz pep talks is not
(2:21:27) here to defend the things that they said earlier and I'm pretty sure that I hit all the ones that you did ask uh forgive
(2:21:33) me if I didn't so uh Nick Bron says trans daddy chill not sure what that's
(2:21:41) about uh I think that's me but no I won't chill okay bro bro calm down bro calm
(2:21:49) down calm down calm down calm down you chill chill
(2:21:55) out just just calm down just calm down the stereotypical no man should say this
(2:22:00) to his wife he is an instant like no no every man should always say that to
(2:22:06) their wife that's that's that's how that's supposed to go I know I was just say it The Stereotype is that like you
(2:22:12) say it anyway uh anyway JH GF DF GH J K
(2:22:19) says you got quite the name there there is biological sex then there is gender
(2:22:25) which is what you feel can feelings be deceptive and be socially constructive
(2:22:31) if I feel like I'm a dog am I a dog or am I mistaken slash mentally
(2:22:37) ill so this is another categorical error because that's what most of these are probably going to be and that's okay
(2:22:42) because it's very confusing because it's a complicated issue gender is a construct in the mind species isn't
(2:22:49) species is a measure meable reality that is objective more objective at least and
(2:22:54) gender is a con mind anatomical sex is more of a measurable reality of somebody right it's depicting their physical
(2:23:01) characteristics and that you can change but gender IDE identity is something that's in your
(2:23:07) mind that you can change yeah it's just an so like again if he's saying I'm a
(2:23:13) dog or if I want to say yeah I'm a black woman lesbian you you have to say it's
(2:23:18) true because that's your definition to say it's true if gender if gender identity is changeable it's not
(2:23:24) immutable so if it's not immutable man with a full bladder yeah so if it's so if it's not immutable will then you're
(2:23:31) going to have to take the the L here that anybody who has a mind State just a
(2:23:36) mind State a fixated mind state of I am thing and you agree you are thing because you think you're thing then they
(2:23:43) can't be lying that's the same metric that you're using this would be the same thing with religion this would be the same thing for all these things the
(2:23:49) metric of harm and utils from your view would have to be based around the the
(2:23:55) belief in thing X in mind is true if that's the case then the benefit and
(2:24:00) utility would always externally be the outgrowth of those of of those beliefs
(2:24:05) from the util perspective like how do you get around that man I feel like a big conflict that you're describing is
(2:24:11) honestly just a misunderstanding because what part do you think I don't understand no no no
(2:24:17) well I don't know if you would misunderstand but religious people misunderstand what honestly they
(2:24:24) misunderstand what transgender means they misunderstand what gender IDE idea identity means I think that's because
(2:24:31) you guys equivocate I think it's because you guys equivocate you say there's a distinction between like I do agree with
(2:24:38) you I'll I'll give you an olive branch here I do agree with you that I took u a long amount of time to figure out all of
(2:24:44) the various distinctions between what was being espoused as gender identity versus sex versus why this happens the
(2:24:51) psychological the psychological phenomenon I don't think it's that complicated I think it's reducible very
(2:24:57) simply to just mind State mind State belief equals real to you real to you
(2:25:02) equals respect to you respect to me equals positive utils because if I disrespect you you're more likely to
(2:25:09) kill yourself I think that that is the basic reduction to your argument the problem with it though my friend is that
(2:25:15) it's easily reversible if that is the case then mind State me Christian mind
(2:25:20) State me say will me doing this is disrespectful to me thus upping the rate
(2:25:26) that I might self harm or it causes some harm to me even if it's not at the rate
(2:25:31) of suicide of the uh transgender crowd if you quantify that over billions it
(2:25:37) would have to necessarily have more utils on my behalf than yours do you see what I'm saying let's go back to the
(2:25:43) utils so it is the point I was trying to make before is the fact that you are
(2:25:49) trying to force a thought into my brain that doesn't need to be there I'm not
(2:25:55) you don't have to agree with my identity you don't have to agree with mine okay but but you but has nothing to
(2:26:02) do with the utils it has nothing to do with so like so like you don't have to concede that that Christians are right
(2:26:10) Christians don't have to concede that trans are right if it is the case that we both agree it's a mind state if
(2:26:16) vastly more people agree with my mind State than yours that's still going to be positive utility like there's no way
(2:26:23) around that will no but but again this is a disagreement about this is a
(2:26:29) miscommunication this is what's the miscommunication we're we're not miscommunicating no we are we are not
(2:26:35) you I think General religious people I think General religious people don't understand that gender IDE identity only
(2:26:42) exists in the mind and if they did understand that they would be much more willing to I think they do and I can
(2:26:49) prove it because they say that is [ __ ] and not true it's not true so
(2:26:55) they are saying that the so they're they're actually agreeing with you they're saying this mind state that you have they say it's delusional or it's
(2:27:01) incorrect or we disagree based on a BC or D they are actually affirming that it's a mind state that they disagree
(2:27:09) with no that proves my point because we we as we have established a mind State
(2:27:14) your opinion cannot be wrong it cannot be wrong if that's fact that they say it is wrong
(2:27:21) proves they don't understand it because they are saying it's wrong and you can't say an opinion is wrong you just Uno
(2:27:28) reverso your own your own argument because what what you're saying is they're not wrong who's not wrong religious people
(2:27:36) they believe something in their brain and it disagrees with they're not wrong though right they have a ident they have a
(2:27:43) mindset they can't be wrong and it can't be wrong a that it can't be wrong will
(2:27:49) it can't be wrong because it's their opinion so they're so then they're not wrong so maximum utility would go with
(2:27:55) the most amount of people who are not wrong in this case the Christian will that's the end of that
(2:28:01) argument no the difference is me I want to control my own body I want to control
(2:28:06) my own thoughts that you telling me I can't do that harms me a billion times more than you looking at me and me
(2:28:14) living a certain lifestyle disagree with can't do that thing just we're not going to affirm it for you you can do you you
(2:28:23) want in your head says you have to affirm anything you're trying to force everyone else you [ __ ] is the forcing to do anything you don't do anything
(2:28:29) everyone to see men I say you have to if I put on a Dr I look enough like a woman for you you want everyone to say I'm a
(2:28:36) woman it's you okay well you're just making up an imaginary person that doesn't exist cuz I didn't do that I
(2:28:41) didn't do any of that you're just well I mean you did you you well you did Will to be fair you said Andrew I think you
(2:28:48) understand but General religious people you are actually creating an external monolith other than the guy you're debating with it's just that I'm so good
(2:28:55) faith I'll even engage with that I think because you might agree with I'm a little more of a [ __ ] no no no it's
(2:29:02) not it's not in fact I've been adamantly disagreeing with you it's just that I'm so [ __ ] good faith that I'll even
(2:29:09) engage when it's a straw man because that's how good faith I am because on any any of these tears of topics will
(2:29:17) I'll even even if I grant them you're own logic disputes them over and over
(2:29:22) and over you Uno reverso yourself now the thing is is like you could I could even listen will I'm going to be totally
(2:29:29) honest with you I could actually make the affirmative transposition better than you could God I'm just gonna point
(2:29:35) that out right well well that is a question and we'll get to that somebody does want
(2:29:40) you to steal man eventually but go ahead there William I don't want to cut you off sorry no I'm just saying that you
(2:29:45) you can't because it you can't choose to make someone think of a certain way and say that affects them less when I live
(2:29:53) my lifestyle how does that how much utility is that harming you how much negative utility is that putting on
(2:29:59) someone else you don't have to affirm it you don't have to do anything I don't have to affirm your religion just like
(2:30:04) how you don't have to affirm my gender this all makes my point this makes my point no no it does but gender exists
(2:30:09) still right gender ex and it can yes and religion exists and so where do we get
(2:30:15) our maximum if if if our mind whole debate right now
(2:30:21) but if it is the truth if everything which is in our mind state is the truth
(2:30:27) then you would have to concede that the maximum amount of utility is in the most people are telling the truth you can't say that Christians are not telling the
(2:30:33) truth by your own admission therefore we have maximum utility a mindset is the truth say that
(2:30:40) you did I'll show you in fact in fact you can rewind this you stated it's the truth over and over and over your
(2:30:45) argument is circular your argument starts here now to be fair to you will totally fair almost all arguments are
(2:30:52) circular and there's a good reason for that but you start here you say the affirmations of the Mind are true right
(2:30:58) they have to be true because you the subjective they're not true they're just affirmations that's all they are I
(2:31:04) wouldn't call them true or false they just are they just exist is trans ideology true is it exists is it true it
(2:31:12) can't be true or false okay exists okay great so then Christian ideology by the same metric exists I agree okay so then
(2:31:20) if we start at the point it exists right so therefore it exists and mind State exists so therefore mind State exists I
(2:31:26) believe X if I believe X and most people agree with X affirmation of belief then
(2:31:32) denying X affirmation of belief brings us right back down to but it exists etc etc it goes into a util argument so
(2:31:38) where's maximum utils in the circle is going to be maximum amount of people that that would be this part who believe
(2:31:44) in X thing which is non-falsifiable because it's a belief by Will's admission do you understand
(2:31:51) so I believe what you're saying let me try to steal man a little bit you are saying that most people believe
(2:31:57) transgender that's the confusion is Gen the identity exists you just had
(2:32:04) your mind BL bro I know it's hard you think do you think these religious people would admit that the identity
(2:32:10) exists I think that they would admit that these people believe that yes okay do you no no no I said do you think the
(2:32:17) religious people would agree that the identity EXs at all well I mean as far as they would
(2:32:24) believe that any identity exists so so there we go so the identity does exist
(2:32:30) you would say they would say oh yeah the gender identity exists well as a mind State I think they would agree yeah okay
(2:32:36) so so if they can admit that then they admit trans people are real because
(2:32:41) that's all it is they no that so you you took that one logical step too far they
(2:32:47) would just be admitting the Mind state is real not what transm is not that well
(2:32:53) but then we're going to end up unfortunately circling right back to utils so even if it was the case that
(2:32:59) all transgenderism is is a mind State then that's all Christianity is is a mind state if it is the case that both
(2:33:05) are mind States both are making an affirmation for the Mind State neither one of them are falsifiable if the
(2:33:11) number of people have the Mind State against the number of people who don't is vastly superior than maximum utils
(2:33:18) would be in the people who have the maximum amount of the Mind State that's it very simple it's a it's a very basic
(2:33:24) it's very basic mode of poent right if x then y if y then Z blah blah blah right
(2:33:29) transgenderism yeah does not force other people to believe in transgender neither does Christianity incorrect okay where's
(2:33:36) Christianity forcing you to believe anything have you ever heard of a missionary who tries very hard to convince that's what you are for Trans
(2:33:42) people right now you're a missionary for Trans people right this second no I I I'm explaining
(2:33:49) the fact that something exists not the same you are prizing based on a world view and a mind State bro you're proing
(2:33:57) on behalf of the trans right this you are will in the name of the transgender
(2:34:03) Lord you are here to praz and bring us to the transgender god let's bring it
(2:34:09) down enough the difference is there is no transgender Health oh we got P that's the difference let me explain why that's
(2:34:16) important let me explain why that's very important it's right because religious people think that they need to force
(2:34:24) their ideas onto somebody how are they forcing them let me explain I'm just said they they feel like they need to
(2:34:30) force this Ida off what's the force I need that explain Lord I just want to force explain how they they're let me
(2:34:36) say it like this their incentive to convince people that they are right is for extraordin that's why I changed what
(2:34:43) I said the incentive they have to change to change people's mind and believe what
(2:34:48) they believe is extraordinarily almost infinitely greater than a trans person is to change other people's minds about
(2:34:54) why here prizing on behalf of trans and where's the force will okay I already took Force out of the yeah so so then
(2:35:01) Christians aren't forcing you to believe anything let so then if Christians their incentive to change people's mind is infinitely greater than a trans person
(2:35:07) is to change other people's mind that's why Christians and religious people will shove things down trans people's throat
(2:35:14) that they disagree with in their mind like you need to do this or you're going to be tortured for Infinity like you
(2:35:20) need to do this or I'll kill myself well being tortured for Infinity
(2:35:25) wait no killing yourself is my personal choice you don't have you can that's right you don't have to but do this do
(2:35:31) this or I'll [ __ ] kill myself that's not force well it's it's not the incentive
(2:35:38) for you to convince me to be a Christian is very great the incentive for me you
(2:35:44) that transgenderism is true is very minimal compar why are you trying to do it the that the that key difference that
(2:35:50) incentive difference is why one is much harsher much more um much more narrow
(2:35:58) down focus and pressures these small indiv groups of people in a much harsher
(2:36:03) light than transgenderism does to everybody else in the world so let me get right Christians prze not utilizing
(2:36:10) Force by your own admission but transgender people say if you don't believe in my ideology I'm going to
(2:36:16) [ __ ] kill myself you think which one sounds more forceful
(2:36:21) will I'm going to kill that is not the threat it's not you believe in this kill myself that is not what people do if I
(2:36:28) don't affirm trans identity what is what is your ultimate argument reduced to if you don't affirm trans identity they're
(2:36:35) going to kill themselves if I disagree with a Christian if I disagree with a Christian are they going to tell me I'm going to go to hell yes I if you
(2:36:42) disagree with a trans wait wait wait that that's actually not accurate it depends uh Catholics and uh Orthodox
(2:36:50) orth well specifically Eastern Orthodox are not going to make a self ific claim Catholics may make a self ific claim
(2:36:56) that's true and many Protestants May though many won't right there's most people no no no it's no no they're not
(2:37:04) most people you're wrong why don't you look up how many Christians are of the Catholic face ver versus Protestant you
(2:37:10) are incorrect but that aside Catholics remember ruled the planet for about uh
(2:37:16) oh I don't know uh 1,200 years or so but anyway the the principle and point and partial here is just this when you say I
(2:37:23) had to walk this back Andrew you're right Christians aren't actually using force or prizing because you had to admit you're prosti on behalf of trans
(2:37:30) ideology that's fair I'm not disputing that what I am disputing is when we're talking about Force Doctrine itself
(2:37:36) Christians are not forcing you to believe in Christ that would be antithetical to Christian doctrine in
(2:37:42) fact if we forced you to believe in Christ that wouldn't be true belief you and what you're prizing on behalf of
(2:37:48) though is you affirm this is true or I'll put a gun in my mouth and blow my
(2:37:54) [ __ ] brains out that sir is force that is transgender people do not say
(2:38:00) that transgender people are not going to approach gender person let me finish my statement I just want to know why we
(2:38:06) should affirm them oh my [ __ ] god why should we affirm them why do we if we don't what happens what okay we affirm
(2:38:12) we should affirm transgender people because we should respect people just
(2:38:18) like how we should not go into a Christian church and paint the whole thing red and say all of this is a lie
(2:38:24) we should not we should not go and disregard the feelings that they have towards their religion because that
(2:38:31) matters too we should respect that just like we should respect someone's gender right so then therefore if that is the
(2:38:37) case that we should respect Christians as much as we respect trans then their opinion that transgender people are
(2:38:43) incorrect and that there's only two Sexes and that this gender thing is totally [ __ ] you should affirm it
(2:38:48) and if you shouldn't affir it then what you're saying is no I agree that the trans people are correct and that their
(2:38:55) ideology is correct and I have a more utilitarian version argument for why I
(2:39:01) just think that that utilitarian argument that you would base it on would be because if you don't affirm this
(2:39:06) identity trans people will kill themselves and I'd like to know how that reduction is
(2:39:12) incorrect I tried to follow what you're saying but let me try to repeat what you said sure basic basically you're saying
(2:39:18) that the reduction of trans people trying to kill themselves is the main motivation that trans people are putting forward so
(2:39:24) that other people will agree I'm saying it's the primary utilitarian argument it has to be it's the primary utilitarian
(2:39:30) argument yeah I think otherwise otherwise you're at like an impass right so if it's just the case I don't [ __ ]
(2:39:37) believe you but you should believe me then who cares we're at we're at the same uh util set except I can say I have
(2:39:44) more positive util because more people agree with me so the only reduction you could give from there would be
(2:39:49) well trans person says no this is actually maximum U because if you don't affirm this I'll do the ultimate thing
(2:39:57) which is bad which is kill myself like I don't I don't see how you get around that so so I think really at the end of
(2:40:04) the day our society has greater utility when we respect each other would you agree with that Andrew
(2:40:10) No in fact I I I I don't even think you would I don't even think you would agree with that like Donald Trump is a
(2:40:16) president do you respect him I I have I have to right no you don't [ __ ] come on
(2:40:22) don't [ __ ] me bro you don't [ __ ] respect Donald Trump they not gonna have a war over you don't respect Donald
(2:40:28) Trump though come on right if if I'm trying to work with somebody that's what I'm going to do yeah but you don't
(2:40:34) though right if I'm trying to promote growth if I'm trying to fck just answer the truth you don't respect Donald just
(2:40:40) because you don't like my truth doesn't mean it's wrong I just want to know okay so just honestly then you respect Donald
(2:40:45) Trump just say yes or no I will respect him to work with him yes or no you respect Donald Trump I just answered
(2:40:51) this I'm not going to no you didn't yes or no you know no yeah you didn't really answer it yes or no I respect Donald
(2:40:57) Trump what do you mean respect whatever you mean by respect oh well I already answered I will respect him you will but
(2:41:03) that's not that's not my question what's my question do you so let me ask you I don't know what that means do you don't
(2:41:10) know what he's not in the room with me I can't do anything to respect you don't know what respect means why are we talking about trans respect because you
(2:41:16) know trans people and you can communicate to them we do Ace now there fellas so I I do want to ask a question
(2:41:21) just because uh it was brought up in our chat earlier it's not in our super chats but Speak Easy out right now so I'll
(2:41:26) just ask it uh Donald Trump uh you know he he made what was it declaration I
(2:41:32) don't know an executive law that there's uh two genders so um yeah maybe we could
(2:41:37) talk a little bit about that so Andrew uh yeah what do you what do you think that's going to change about American
(2:41:43) culture uh his declaration or signing the executive orders we maybe uh could
(2:41:49) be talking about that but I'm not sure like I said I'm or not so I'll give it um I'll give
(2:41:54) it multiple different views so from the first view my view uh as a Christian I
(2:42:01) completely agree with him that of course the best thing that you can do when you have a society where birth rates are in
(2:42:07) collapse is do everything you can to affirm that man and woman should be
(2:42:13) together and a nuclear family which is the backbone of the entirety of American
(2:42:18) society all societies by the way or the cross-generational family which would tune into what the nuclear family became
(2:42:25) is completely correct and by the way that type of positive reinforcement is not propaganda this is for the health of
(2:42:33) the nation that in and of itself would have maximum utility even from his view
(2:42:38) it would have maximum utility to affirm that the nuclear family should be um
(2:42:44) kind of pushed up above all alternative Lifestyles just for the purpose of the birth rate itself you can't have people
(2:42:51) ex have experiences which are good or bad from a hedonic calculus unless they
(2:42:56) [ __ ] exist they can't exist if you're not birthing them so I think ultimately
(2:43:02) it's a good thing it's a great idea he should affirm this and he's
(2:43:07) aligning with the majority of the world when it comes to what we think in terms
(2:43:13) of sex and what we think in terms of gender being interchangeable with sex and even a utilitarian is going to have
(2:43:19) to Grant this which is why he's been granting it all night he really doesn't have a choice they don't have a choice
(2:43:25) let's let William respond a little bit to some of what you're saying there since uh I I take it you're also in
(2:43:30) America there will I mean correct me if I'm wrong but uh this is also are you in a good State though well that's what
(2:43:35) matters a good I think you would say I am are you right well go ahead I want him to engage with the saying so I I do
(2:43:44) not obviously agree that Donald Trump saying that we all have to have one of two genders is a good thing in fact I
(2:43:50) would go ahead and say it's a backwards thinking idea right we're going backwards in terms of how our social
(2:43:57) understanding of psychology works we understand that it's very simple their cavemen thought this and we thought this
(2:44:05) for lots of years when we were very primitive that there were two genders is very simple for us to understand and comprehend as primitive people but now
(2:44:10) that we've gotten older and we've gotten wiser we recognize that that was just a oversimplified approximation for what
(2:44:18) represents true reality true reality is much more complicated than that and to dictate that we can't acknowledge what
(2:44:24) is real anymore and we have to go with the Dogma that Donald Trump gives us is
(2:44:29) a shame and it's a backwards uh way to produce policy but how can can you call it Dogma when that's what you're talking
(2:44:35) about the entire night you're prosing on behal of of a dogmatic belief no Dogma
(2:44:40) mine is what part of what I said about gender idea identity gender expression and sex
(2:44:46) is wrong well well not only can I point to multiple things you said were wrong like the third like the third sex for
(2:44:52) instance that was completely incorrect the other thing is is that the gender bred and the entire demonstration of the
(2:44:58) genderbread when you're talking about a mind State it's actually not saying that it's not making the affirmation that the
(2:45:04) Mind state is true you did say all mind states are true just because they're mind States so if that's the case what
(2:45:10) you ultimately are reduced to is that all mind states are true My Religion my religion is true your pration of
(2:45:17) transgenderism is true so then just have to get down to barebones utility and the more people hang on bro I didn't
(2:45:23) interrupt you a single time did I oh yeah you no why you gave your entire dissertation about TR did I interrupt no
(2:45:30) right not this one time didn't I didn't when we're having an exchange it's fair for us to interrupt each other right we
(2:45:35) agree yeah well this is an exchange like yeah yeah yeah I I agree but but usually when you make the like statement time to
(2:45:42) make it you can go person let's get back without the meta there fellas well the meta here was important
(2:45:48) but but that side that aside I'm just saying if if if you're affirming all mind states are true uh then I'm just
(2:45:55) happy to Grant it to just show you that still maximum utility is going to be in my ballpark not in yours so uh let me
(2:46:02) ask you this come on I wanted to respond to what you said yeah yeah but I'll just I'll just ask the question you can
(2:46:08) respond and then answer the question too right so all I'll end it with is is just this question birth rates being higher
(2:46:15) at least to the point where you can repr produce your own Society is going to be good for your nation no matter what no
(2:46:22) matter what nation you're in and if the entire world is in the problem of birth rates and all of it is except a few
(2:46:29) places in Africa and even that with industrialization birth rates will fall that's going to uh unfortunately deplete
(2:46:36) labor and we need that labor to feed the world we know this because we've almost eliminated starvation so I'd like you to
(2:46:43) respond to that clear go ahead it's related to the gender thing well it's it's related because you were shaking
(2:46:49) your head about birth rates because you just want to import people to replace births that's why so
(2:46:56) okay so I think the reason I was shaking my head if I can recall correctly is that you said we are we are declining
(2:47:02) rapidly in birth rates and that's absolutely happening in America is it not gaining as much acceleration upwards
(2:47:08) as we used to be yes that's true but that's not necessarily a bad thing for society an upward direct straight up
(2:47:14) growth in population is not always what's most beneficial to society and let me go back to what you were saying
(2:47:20) before about ideas being true or not have I or have I not multiple times said
(2:47:26) in this debate that what you believe in yourself your opinion your favorite color the gender you have the religion
(2:47:33) you have because it's just a state of mind is just that it is a state of mind it exists as a state of mind no you said
(2:47:40) it's true what do you mean it's wait wait wait is my favorite color red is
(2:47:45) that true is yeah you would say it's true right the identity is red yes so then so then
(2:47:52) it's true right no it's not true in an objective it's not true so now your
(2:47:58) favorite color being red is not true in an objective sense it's not right it's a subjective question but in a subjective
(2:48:03) sense it is right which is a different context and okay so then subjectively subjectively so then objectively trans
(2:48:11) identity is not true no trans identity is true to the individual
(2:48:16) objectively objectively there is no no truth okay well then if objectively there is no truth then you can't say
(2:48:24) that trans ideology is true sir I've already said I've already said this multile well then the affirmation is
(2:48:29) that any mind state is true any mind state is not true it's just a mind State it's the way you think
(2:48:36) of yourself it can't be true or false it's just the way you think so is trans identity true or false it exists that's
(2:48:43) what I said before and I keep saying that what did I what did I ask you can you repeat my question well let me spec let me um ask
(2:48:49) hang on hang on bro bro going to ask you I'm going to ask you again and you can ask clarifying
(2:48:54) question I just want to make sure you get it is trans identity true or false
(2:49:00) what part of that are you unclear on I'm unclear because that's a f fallacious question it's called begging the
(2:49:06) question because you're already assuming this concept could be categorized as one
(2:49:11) of those two things not what begging because it simply exists I'll respond that's not actually what begging the
(2:49:17) question means can you pull up the begging the question fallacy oh I would love to right now because I know and
(2:49:22) read it out loud and Van you're not going to like what you read oh relax B I'll relax don't
(2:49:28) worry we're all just chilling it's been hang on hang on hang on mod let him let him a logical fallacy that occurs when
(2:49:34) an argument assumes the truth of a conclusion I'm not flanders's wife over here oh wait did I assume trying to
(2:49:42) prove did I assume the truth of the conclusion I was trying to prove or did I ask you a question sir truth of the
(2:49:48) conclusion what uh uh you're assuming the truth of the conclusion did I assume the truth of
(2:49:54) the conclusion or did I ask you a question sir ass the truth question you
(2:50:00) might be right about this I might be right about this what is the fallacy when you yeah I'm right about this sorry
(2:50:05) what is the fallacy that the question has something wrong ask you a fa good faith question that would be the fallacy
(2:50:12) fallacy no the question has a something wrong in it already oh well that's well
(2:50:18) the well it depends so there there could be so first of all when you're talking about questions questions generally
(2:50:25) aren't going to be in the categorization of fallacy fallacy is going to uh point to an argument which is flawed so you
(2:50:32) have two different types of arguments you have valid and sound if you have a valid argument uh this is talking about
(2:50:38) the premises if you're talking about a sound argument it's talking about the conclusion in this case uh none of these
(2:50:43) are fallacies because I just asked you a question when you said you're using a begging the question poliy that actually
(2:50:49) made no sense because I asked you a question you don't even know what begging the question means bro you
(2:50:54) you've got you've got to stop this man you you're your own worst [ __ ] enemy don't even worry Andrew so your
(2:51:03) question has something false in the premise that was the point I was trying to make your Prem was well that's fine
(2:51:08) you would just say then if that's the case you would say um that well first of all I didn't give you a premise because
(2:51:14) it's a question a premise would be an argument no premise questions can be wrong right what color is the number one
(2:51:20) is a wrong question the premise is wrong what's wrong about the question because colors can't have numbers or it's sorry
(2:51:26) okay okay so so wait so the so the question wasn't wrong because you had an answer to the question right no I
(2:51:33) don't you you would say there's no colors to numbers what's wrong with the
(2:51:38) question be because that's not an answer to the question the question dictated that is an answer to the question the
(2:51:43) question dictated a number sorry a then you could answer the question and say well the thing is is that uh numbers
(2:51:50) don't have colors or you could say numbers do have colors or you can say any number of different things I could say that but the main point I'm trying
(2:51:56) to come across is the premise of the argument was there's no well wa wait arguments are not questions sir the the
(2:52:04) did I said the argument I meant the premise of the question I said the premise of the question there's no premises to questions that's of course
(2:52:10) premise to questions how do you how do you have a premise for a question premises are arguments color what color is the number one has a premise the
(2:52:16) premise is that numbers can have colors that's Prem premises premises are based around arguments or positions they're
(2:52:24) not based around question on to the next question so so here like let me let me ask you this right yeah if I ask you
(2:52:30) this question um uh how tall are short
(2:52:35) people what's actually wrong with that question that's an that's that's a difficult question to answer yeah it's a
(2:52:41) difficult question to answer but but the thing is is like there's nothing actually wrong with the question what
(2:52:46) you're talking about is you're talking about the validity of an argument or the soundness of an argument questions don't
(2:52:52) have premises that's not how questions absolutely have premises okay I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I'll give you 100 bucks right now Google do
(2:52:58) questions have premises oh let's do it you kind of surprised you're
(2:53:07) AR is made him bet the hundred bucks too because you're wrong no he did he did bet it I'll say
(2:53:14) 510 510 is is is tall for short
(2:53:24) yeah the answer is no you can you so wheny want associated with arguments well I'll venmo you but yeah Veno it
(2:53:31) Veno it bro I'm sorry that this like this this is good for you to learn this [ __ ] I need to I'm learning I'm learning
(2:53:38) now here here's here's the thing here's the thing here's the thing bro will you venmo it over to Speak Easy Speak Easy
(2:53:44) give me your venmo real quick I'm going to take a leak I don't have V I have cash at okay

(2:53:56) right now tell me when you you get that 100 bucks de right well we could I don't
(2:54:04) know if we should continue with questions if Andrew is not here uh well we have uh other ones that we can unpack
(2:54:10) and I think Speak Easy uh fairly could have some floor time and of course will
(2:54:15) you are doing a fantastic job holding down your side of the fort on your own
(2:54:22) um I am Speak Easy on PayPal I'll get the link oh you guys your bets everybody
(2:54:29) always making bets on stream it's been a long time since this has happened for me I have to say like did you guys did you

(2:54:46) ah somebody need getting a couple bucks sorry I had I had to take a leak I don't mean to cut off the moderator did you send that 100 yet I no I don't think
(2:54:53) it's happened yet what did you do did you uh force it out with like 400 PSI
(2:54:59) what are you doing that was so fast oh man did you get your 100
(2:55:04) bucks uh not yet I I sent him the name I'm just getting the link for okay okay
(2:55:09) yeah yeah yeah we've got it sent over uh but no that's uh I was just making commentary about the fact that uh this
(2:55:17) this always seems to happen when we're having these style debates somebody gets bet a certain amount of money and then
(2:55:23) somebody's anyway gambling you guys all right Rave uh we do not gamble on
(2:55:30) YouTube what happens is we have respect for the other person and because we have that type of respect when when we have a
(2:55:37) disagreement we pay for it with our mouth or our wallet from our mou there
(2:55:43) go potic there you go I didn't say I didn't say the g word that's that's yeah that's didn't say that not good yeah I
(2:55:49) didn't I didn't um it's in your imagination gaslighting everybody now
(2:55:54) all right Mike Alo says modern day debates this is off topic but a debate
(2:56:00) request I'd love to see a One V one debate with Maya reports versus Destiny
(2:56:05) on Trump versus Biden is Biden is Biden still alive
(2:56:10) anyway uh let's let's carry on to the next Super Chat doc City USA said did
(2:56:17) there's the payp foration my goodness all right so doc C said did Jesus identify as God regardless of reality
(2:56:24) not showing one and people accept him as one how is that not a delusion as well
(2:56:31) GE I gotta start I got to start doing this as well I could I could use a couple extra box fellas you got to give me some directions here all right I just
(2:56:38) picking so did Jesus identify as God did you want to start on that one Speak Easy
(2:56:44) or Andrew I think they uh Jesus did identify as God you'll actually find
(2:56:51) this in John 1:1 and so here's what you'll find in John 1:1 this just off the top of my head please excuse me if I
(2:56:58) don't remember it 100% accurately uh but it goes something like
(2:57:03) this uh in the beginning there was the word the Word was God and the Word was
(2:57:10) with God and then later in John he explains that the word became flesh and
(2:57:15) that flesh was a reference to Jesus Christ so yes it is the case that Jesus
(2:57:20) Christ is God yeah he also said I and the father are one so yeah many
(2:57:28) times you got it uh I think we'll move on from that one guys uh just because we do have quite a few super chats and uh
(2:57:35) yeah Andrew and will got into an unpack Fest there for a while uh but it was a
(2:57:41) lot okay can we but but real quick moderator I'm very sorry to cut in you've been very good this evening Speak
(2:57:47) Easy have you got in your bucks yet not yet will can we can we can we put can we
(2:57:53) put a priority on this will well the thing is the first Google I search said no but a thing is I'm finding other
(2:57:58) sources that might be disagreeing with that initial there's no sour philosophically might not you [ __ ]
(2:58:05) serious dude you know what it would have been funny if you had sent 100 for
(2:58:11) being if you had sent that 100 for being good faith I would have sent you two and said we don't even need your money
(2:58:16) because that would have been even funnier but but the thing is is like bro you lost that one no no no no I I I
(2:58:23) valid I very much do not believe that I was correct when I was starting to go in that direction yeah then you you got to
(2:58:28) send the hundred bro I just told you it was not so I very well am right in
(2:58:34) premises being in questions no you know premises are not in questions premise is an assumption would
(2:58:42) you agree uh it can be an assumption it can be an assumption an assumption can
(2:58:47) be in question would you agree of course it can be a part of the question yeah but that doesn't mean questions that
(2:58:54) doesn't mean that qu questions are are premise no but a premise can be in a question no a premise can't be in a
(2:59:00) question you just said an assumption can be in a question yeah but but assump when you're talking about logic when
(2:59:06) you're talking about logical arguments when you're talking about premises premises are an engagement of formal or
(2:59:12) formal logic that's formal logic a question itself is not formal logic you
(2:59:18) can do an internal critique and then you can make a counterargument which would have a premise right but you just asking
(2:59:25) a question or or something for clarity is not premised but a question can have
(2:59:30) a premise in it it can have assumptions in it okay show me show I'll tell you what show me a question with a
(2:59:36) premise what color is God that's not a premise what's the premise 100% is a
(2:59:41) premise what's the premise the Assumption which is the premise is that God exists okay so wait so a Prem
(2:59:48) premise would be God exists the question itself is not a premise the question itself is not it is
(2:59:56) because it's assuming that God exists uh no the assumption is already there well there there is an assumption baked in
(3:00:01) there that's true but there's no premise baked in there a premise is an assumption assumption a premise is a part of the validity of a sound argument
(3:00:10) that's it wait but no you admitted a premise can be an assumption you no I said that
(3:00:17) you can have Prem are which are assumptions that's true so if then that means an assumption
(3:00:24) inem wait this is actually fallacious on your part just because a premise is an
(3:00:30) assumption doesn't mean a question which assumes is a premise do you
(3:00:35) understand honestly what you said didn't make sense because a premise is an
(3:00:40) assumption question is premise just because a premise yeah just because a
(3:00:45) premise can be an assumption doesn't mean a question has an assumption
(3:00:51) therefore questions are not premises no but questions can have premises in them okay show me
(3:00:58) one what color is God that's not a premise that's not that's not wait the
(3:01:03) foundation of the question the foundation of the question is already assuming God's existence no the premise
(3:01:09) would be the premise would be is there a god or there is no God therefore what's
(3:01:16) the question part what's the question in a premise what premise can you give me where you're asking if a dog is a cat
(3:01:22) can you say can you say in a premise for instance is a dog a
(3:01:28) cat I'm saying premises are within questions not questions are within premises okay so then questions are not
(3:01:34) premises now pay up that's not what we said no questions can have premises in
(3:01:39) them the Prem okay show me one the premise of I don't remember what the original question was that had the premise in it but there is no there
(3:01:46) listen there is what color is God has you asking a question has nothing to do
(3:01:52) with a premises for an argument a premise is based around argument not around a question there's no Source now
(3:01:59) you can look up sources which will say there can be inferences to questions that's true but that has nothing to do
(3:02:05) with questions themselves being a part of a premise that is not what a premise is a premise is a base for an argument
(3:02:12) for its validity which would lead into whether or not it is uh sound that's it
(3:02:17) you already established that assumptions can be premises no I only established that a
(3:02:24) premacy can start with an assumption why don't you get you guys you guys are in the deep end but you
(3:02:30) know what I'm the one who doesn't get it there's no there's no deep end you ow 100 bucks you lost bro so it's all good
(3:02:37) I'm just gonna ask I'm just saying I would have paid it out I would have paid it I I understand that and you know what
(3:02:42) if if if you got it to spare Andrew I mean I'm your boy but uh I will say uh
(3:02:49) you know in the interest of fairness I could always put up a poll uh or we could just move on from here it's up to
(3:02:55) uh it's up to y'all so uh where you guys at I can put up a poll and ask our audience what they think put up the
(3:03:02) poll even the Liberals even the Liberals are going to agree with me though watch can a premise be in a question is
(3:03:09) the poll nope that's not the poll the poll is is a question of premise that's not what I said that is what you said no
(3:03:17) it's not a question that's not true though that's factually not true that there's a
(3:03:23) premise in a question you're wrong both ways no matter which way you cut it you're still wrong both ways all right I
(3:03:29) think we'll just we'll move on from here and we're GNA let that one play out in the uh sphere of the public eye and uh
(3:03:36) you know if you guys ever meet up again in your own spaces I mean I'm not sure if you know how to get a hold of each other but uh not my circus not my pony
(3:03:44) you guys you know what you know what I'll pay it I'll pay it to speak easy on your behalf um just because I feel bad
(3:03:51) for you will I would have paid up because bro like you could just look at it yourself look at it yourself
(3:03:58) literally how how am I wrong here how am I wrong look at what if a premise a
(3:04:04) premise is a form of argumentation which gives validity to
(3:04:10) the conclusion of an argument or you can have a sound argument which is referring
(3:04:16) in a reference to the conclusion a question itself is not a premise that's [ __ ] insane and that was your
(3:04:23) assertion you are completely wrong and you need to pay up here you're
(3:04:28) misrepresenting what I said originally a question is tell what you said a question is not a premise that is not my statement I said questions can have
(3:04:34) premises within them give me and the question can be wrong based on what the premise is because the Prem can be wrong
(3:04:41) question is gaining information a premise is giving it yeah exactly exactly you're what you're saying is a
(3:04:48) premise can have an inference of a question that is not the same thing as a question can
(3:04:53) have a um you know a a structure for argument it that's not that's not how
(3:04:59) that works bro you said assumpt assumptions can be premises okay give me a premise question hang on Prem a
(3:05:06) premise question what color is 30 seconds that's not a [ __ ] premise it is because the premise is God's
(3:05:11) existence no no God's existence is a part of the question no answers that
(3:05:18) it is true that I could it is true I could make a counter I could make a counter to your argument via or I can
(3:05:24) make a counter to your question by saying wait a second this doesn't contend with my argument or the validity
(3:05:29) of my argument but you just asking the question itself
(3:05:34) premise question what's premise one for your question for what color is God yeah
(3:05:42) okay premise one PR one they they're not numbered a premise in that question is God does exist
(3:05:48) ah I see and is that a different uh statement than what color is God you
(3:05:55) asking does you you saying God doesn't exist or does exist is built into the
(3:06:01) premise the question itself is not a premise though do you see the question isn't a premise the question has a
(3:06:08) premise ah the question isn't a premise what is the premise for the question one
(3:06:15) of the premises is that God exists at all that's a premise to the it's an assumption would the word assumption be
(3:06:22) correct so so you saying you you have presupposed a thing and then put it in a premise is not a
(3:06:29) question would assumption fix all of this to you nope because so because here
(3:06:34) I'll explain yeah if you presuppose thing X and then put it in a premise that's not asking a question yeah no you
(3:06:40) put it in a question okay so give me a Prem tell me a Prem so then tell me a premise that has a question
(3:06:48) no it's a question that has a premise okay so tell me a question that has a premise what color is God is a question
(3:06:55) that's a premise would you say the question has an assumption you would say in a premise if God has a color X would
(3:07:01) you say it's an assumption would you say the question has an assumption in it oh sure questions can have assumptions that
(3:07:08) is what I meant and you did originally state that assumptions can be premises
(3:07:14) you said that yes but because an assumption can be a premise does not mean that because a question can have an
(3:07:19) assumption that that means that a question itself is a premise that makes
(3:07:25) no sense what's the difference all right we do need to move I said 30 seconds a long time so the difference is in a
(3:07:31) premise you're making an assertion of a truth claim based on something which is axiomatic or some type of presupposed
(3:07:37) starting point the distinction between that and a question is you're asking about the validity of the premise or
(3:07:44) you're asking a a question before the validity of the premise but it has nothing to do with it being a premise
(3:07:49) itself you have to pay here bro it's a fun oh my God it's aor I'm sorry all
(3:07:55) right that disappoints me because you are just you're just factually wrong here a question is not a premise I don't
(3:08:02) know what to tell say question of premise you did you said all question Prem all right hold on I don't want to
(3:08:08) put you guys on you're trying to reframe whole entire discussion we've been doing really well but uh yeah I don't want to
(3:08:13) chorus anybody into paying money but I would encourage you not not to uh not to
(3:08:18) make any Bets with each other uh we do have uh a pretty hardcore we don't bet here that's ridiculous yeah oh I didn't
(3:08:26) say the b word either oh my God just the worst all right modernday debates poll
(3:08:32) is up right now and if you haven't voted it I put it as who had the facts tonight
(3:08:37) so we got 9% for William we got 7% for Speak Easy 3% for pep talks and then
(3:08:46) whopping 81% for Andrew wait wait wait I just figured this out um I I just
(3:08:53) figured out how to hang on hang on how to demonstrate this I was thinking about this give me an argument give me an
(3:08:59) argument based purely in questions that's not what I'm saying is
(3:09:06) that's not relevant to this an argument B give me an argument based only in
(3:09:12) questioned that's not because because that's not premise answering a [ __ ]
(3:09:19) question bro that's why you can't do it I if it were continue to agree that
(3:09:24) premise a premise could be a question then it would be the case logically if a
(3:09:29) premise could be a question that you could do an entire argument in the form of questions Prem a straw man no there's
(3:09:36) no straw man hangang not saying I'll shut up and let you respond I just want
(3:09:41) to hear this couldn't get let's go through it guys if all if if it is true
(3:09:47) that premises can be questions or questions are premises then give me an argument in all premises and if you
(3:09:54) can't that can't be true if x then y go
(3:09:59) ahead I have already stated that is not my stance premises are not questions I
(3:10:05) agree that is not what I said in the beginning of this then that's it premes are not questions premises are questions
(3:10:12) brother up brother up brother but questions can have premises which we're going to rewind it and we're wait
(3:10:19) questions questions can have premacy okay if questions can have premises yes
(3:10:24) then give me an exact premacy for a question if God what color is God has
(3:10:30) the premise that God exists so F I don't even know what to do with this I I know
(3:10:35) this is crazy that you're not understanding this I I don't
(3:10:41) understand all guys hold on we're going in circles on this uh not that it hasn't
(3:10:46) been fun but I think we've reached the end of the fun and we're just repeating ourselves at this point uh so uh let's
(3:10:53) get back and engage with the audience a bit more Justin Henley says King Justin I think he's being funny there uh
(3:11:00) saying he's King Justin asks since you can H can so much oh no this is not
(3:11:07) worded well since you can have so much about reducing self deletion should
(3:11:13) people be allowed to hold their own life Hostage to control other people how is this not what transol deletion is
(3:11:23) doing I did my best there's uh some spelling errors here but uh did you want
(3:11:28) to start with that one will yeah no I don't think I don't think
(3:11:33) that's what they're doing first of all that's not what the transgender Community is doing they're not holding in in hostage you know someone feeling
(3:11:40) so much suffering and pain that they eventually resort to to committing that
(3:11:47) act isn't it's not holding you hostage it's their life and how they feel makes them
(3:11:55) feel like they have no other Escape except for that and the fact that you keep focusing on how that makes you guys
(3:12:00) feel trapped because they feel even more trapped to the point of they will commit
(3:12:05) this act is is really just misrepresenting the entire entire subject like I think you actually agree
(3:12:12) it's it's a it's an emotional hostage taking right like so if you had a girlfriend
(3:12:17) that told you she was going to end her life if you left her should you be
(3:12:23) obligated to stay to make sure she doesn't end her life so that's not trans would she be hostage taking that is
(3:12:30) different thought their will and that we'll move on that is not analogous that is not an analogous statement because
(3:12:35) that's not what trans people are doing trans people aren't telling you if you don't tell me blank I'm going to kill myself saying not affirming them leads
(3:12:41) them to ending their lives just because that is true doesn't mean they're threatening that and that's the difference between a hostage taking
(3:12:47) we're going to ask the next question there fellas even Lord says transgenderism seems like a self-correcting problem if Society
(3:12:54) excludes them they remove themselves uh a 0.03% removal of population is
(3:13:02) small uh any thoughts there
(3:13:07) will uh was it that they don't care that they're committing the EXA is that is that the
(3:13:15) idea did you repeat it one more time sorry yeah if I was going to word it uh it's
(3:13:20) it's another one of these really hot takes uh like you guys said earlier this might be one that we just uh if it's
(3:13:28) just disrespectful then there's no real reason to entertain it it's a hot take uh Jesus Iber martinz says swi syndrome
(3:13:37) a rare genetic condition people with XY chromosomes and uh have all normal
(3:13:43) female reproductive organs and appear female what gender are
(3:13:50) they so this is a good question so we have to go back to what do we even mean
(3:13:55) by gender are we talking about their identity are we talking about their expression are we talking about their anatomical sex all three of these
(3:14:03) categories are on a spectrum and they're they're used to simplify things but at
(3:14:09) the end of the day the description of the physical reality is what's more important and if they want to identify a
(3:14:16) certain way that's their choice so so you're you're saying they can be three genders all at
(3:14:23) once yeah you're on mute Andrew yeah sure you may be talking to his crew yeah
(3:14:29) there's no there's no hard rules about how gender identity works it's how you perceive yourself in your own mind yeah
(3:14:35) that's why it's useless right you you talked about its utility earlier but like what utility does have I can
(3:14:41) literally I I can say you're a woman and you should just be able to say that's I'm telling the the
(3:14:47) truth so if you want to affirm someone's identity that's respectful and generally
(3:14:53) nice you don't have to no one's forcing you at gunpoint to do that um the utility in gender identity is in the way
(3:15:02) it makes someone feel when you say when you say I just want to ask you something when you say if this doesn't happen then
(3:15:11) this will be the outcome you're saying that's not a threat so what is it is it a promise like what is it if this
(3:15:17) doesn't happen then this will happen so yeah when when when transgender people say if I don't get affirmed if I'm not
(3:15:25) allowed to go into the woman's washroom then I'm going to end my life is that if
(3:15:30) that's not a threat what is it so they aren't saying that vocally to you it's
(3:15:36) not threatening you no they don't I don't hang with these people but Happ
(3:15:41) very trag it happens very tragically and it's horrible that we even have to have this discussion at all but it is not a
(3:15:48) threat because hangang not a threat what is it I'm sorry they're not using it as a
(3:15:53) tool to manipulate you uh Andrew hasn't had a chance to sing his teeth on this question yet so what's going on Andrew well hang on hang on I I do want to
(3:16:00) bring it back to the money ospg but but but I have I have I have one more way to
(3:16:05) demonstrate this okay one more we still on this one all right all right I will go use the washroom you demonstrate your
(3:16:11) your CL do questions have to have a hang on do questions have to have a conclusion
(3:16:19) do questions have to have conclusions yes I don't even know what that means
(3:16:25) does so does a premise need to have a conclusion premise ABC conclusion does a
(3:16:30) premise are you do you are you saying questions need to have answers is that what you're saying no no no no when I
(3:16:35) give you a formal argument premise one 2 3
(3:16:41) conclusion does do premises need to have a conclusion they need to have an
(3:16:47) assertion they need to have a conclusion too otherwise what are you making the premise for the assert if you want to
(3:16:53) call it a conclusion I would use the word assertion it's assuming something well no that's in the premise I'm
(3:16:58) talking about the conclusion so premise One X premise b x premise c x conclusion
(3:17:04) y right questions don't have conclusions if that's how you want to Define yes so if questions don't have conclusions and
(3:17:10) premises must have a conclusion we have deduced what premises must have conclus
(3:17:16) wait wait yes yeah premises must have conclusions yes look it up does a premise need a
(3:17:21) conclusion so so so let's talk about this let's talk about this okay let's so you're saying premises need to have
(3:17:27) conclusions yes right a premise that is within a question might have a
(3:17:33) conclusion in it but the question isn't making a conclusion how do you make an
(3:17:39) argument how do you make an argument how do you make an argument yeah no no you
(3:17:44) there's no wrong answer you can Google it I'm not even upset Google it go I was how to make no you can you should how do
(3:17:52) you make an argument you get a lot of supporting facts that support AR a
(3:17:58) logical argument how do you make a logical argument go with go with your point if you want so so a philosophical
(3:18:03) argument you have premises and you have a conclusion premise a b c d conclusion
(3:18:09) X right okay that's how you make a philosophical or logical
(3:18:15) argument okay you agree well you those premises sound synonymous with assumptions right perhaps so what
(3:18:22) okay but you but premises have Aus questions can have assumptions in them but do questions have conclusions do
(3:18:29) I've already said no it's a question then then if that's the cas then we can use logic so here I'll do I'll
(3:18:36) demonstrate it for you premise one do questions have to have conclusions
(3:18:42) premise uh or or no sorry questions don't need to have conclusions there we go premise onee questions do not need to
(3:18:49) have conclusions premise two all arguments which have validity have
(3:18:56) premises and then premise three if all uh logical arguments
(3:19:03) require premises with conclusions and questions have no premise then it would be the case that uh
(3:19:11) logically uh if a question has no conclusion then a conclusion is not a
(3:19:17) pre or a a premise would lead to a conclusion so therefore conclusion would
(3:19:24) be questions are not premises and questions cannot have
(3:19:29) premises and and questions cannot have premises different right questions having them and questions them beings
(3:19:36) can't have premises questions can't have premises but they can have assumptions but they can have premises
(3:19:41) what's the difference between a premise and assumption well a premise could be an assertion without an assumption but
(3:19:46) can but What's the diff be an assertion without an ass no an assertion can be an assumption it can be but that doesn't
(3:19:53) mean it must be so what's the difference between a premise and assumption uh but I mean something which is stated as a
(3:19:59) fact that would be the difference between a sound or unsound conclusion no but it's the same premise
(3:20:06) and a conclusion and a premise it's not the same assumption are they're they're
(3:20:11) also I think another word you could so then if
(3:20:17) you have an axium right is an axium an assumption yeah okay an axium is an
(3:20:24) assumption like a premise it's not but it's not a question correct but questions can have
(3:20:29) axioms they have assumptions tell question tell me a question which has an axiom you do you want to repeat the same
(3:20:34) question 10,000 times yeah but that's not a question based around it is it's
(3:20:40) based around an aium well it's not based around it's not based around a premise though all of those words are synonyms
(3:20:47) no they're not synonyms Axiom assumption and premise are all synonyms with each other we're
(3:20:53) going to move on wait wait but that has nothing to do with premise Prem here's the word you
(3:21:02) premise premise is not a synonym with axium right and he thought will and then
(3:21:07) we're gonna move on wait no it's not no no no premise is not a synonym with Axiom it's an assumption they're all
(3:21:15) synonyms I'll tell you what I'll tell you what double or nothing if you can pull up right now the synonyms for axium
(3:21:21) wait for axum premise is one of them oh we're on the game show now guys I think
(3:21:27) I'm over this like this is this is going double or nothing all right that's that's fun Honestly though we do have a
(3:21:34) lot of questions still to ask even Lord says could each debater steal man the
(3:21:39) other side yeah so let's uh all right so since you got all the uh all that hot
(3:21:47) piss over there and the gump sh to do that I'm going to start with you will one minute on the floor and then we'll
(3:21:53) let Speak Easy Go and then one minute for Andrew so one minute will Steel Man
(3:21:59) Andrew and speak Easy's side or I I would just say the or or just the general no side it's up to you but
(3:22:06) better to engage with them than anything so one minute I'm going to go with the utility aspect of the of the of the
(3:22:13) Steelman it gives more utility overall if we
(3:22:20) don't allow transgenderism to exist and don't affirm people's CH gender
(3:22:26) identity even though they they think there's more people who don't believe in
(3:22:32) transgenderism and there's less people who do believe in it therefore we should affirm the thing that most people
(3:22:37) believe in because it will help them more because they believe in it I don't agree with that but that's the steal
(3:22:44) man all right one minute on the floor over to you speak easy steal man the
(3:22:50) best as you can the argument for more than two genders and then uh yeah if you want to explain why you don't agree
(3:22:57) that's great oh you're on mute for some reason
(3:23:03) Speak Easy sorry I must have hit my mic here um oh do you have a fancy
(3:23:08) controller is that what I just saw there like a touch touch turn on no no it's just the bottom of the mic I must have
(3:23:15) hit it with my hand there that's why I muted I thought I was to say it looked like a remote for a second I was going
(3:23:20) to say you fancy fella I can't believe you all right one minute I'm not that text um no but basically the argument
(3:23:28) comes down to is gender is has this ambiguous definition split into uh
(3:23:35) gender ID gender expression and and the anatomical view of what they look like
(3:23:44) and we all should uh affirm them allow them into the women's bathrooms and
(3:23:51) men's bathrooms vice versa just because they feel like we
(3:23:58) should all right you got it Andrew one minute on the floor Let's uh hear your
(3:24:03) Steelman there you were ready to roll yeah so the the most goodfaith steel man
(3:24:08) I can give is Will is saying uh gender itself that uh people misunderstand it
(3:24:16) often and what he is explaining is that this is a mind State and that it is a
(3:24:22) true mind State it's not trying to force itself on anybody else and that uh opposition to this is actually trying to
(3:24:29) force itself on you uh also he further kind of extrapolates and says gender
(3:24:35) ideology itself is particularly non-harmful and there's various reasons why he says it's
(3:24:40) non-harmful um I'm trying I'm trying to give the best steal man I can but ultimately what will is saying is that
(3:24:47) gender itself is a mind state which is unfalsifiable that's how I would kind of
(3:24:52) uh reduce it to its it's uh its grounding I would like to ask Will am I
(3:24:58) incorrect here um that that when I reduce it it is a mind state which is
(3:25:05) unfalsifiable is that correct that there's truth in what you said okay
(3:25:10) maybe add that there is the other factor of gender expression which has to do with a culture's perspective of how
(3:25:16) gender works there is the aspect of gender identity which is in your mind you could call it a mind State and then
(3:25:21) there's a cultural aspect of gender that is separate and they don't necessarily need to congru be in congruence with
(3:25:27) each other that's fair I was just trying to steal man at the best I could there's truth in what you said
(3:25:32) okay all right was there truth in was there truth in what you said from my position
(3:25:38) I yeah I hope so I feel like it was when you were addressing the utilitarianism
(3:25:44) aspect do you think you steal man my position correct but you don't think I did no that there's more people who will
(3:25:51) benefit from the utility of it because more people don't believe in transgenderism but
(3:25:59) also it must be the case that because it's a mind state which is unfalsifiable
(3:26:04) that you can't say it's untrue that people would want to do that no but I I I admit this yes right
(3:26:11) it's a mindset then that's that's fair I just wanted you to get the other hand you know or the other aspect to it just
(3:26:17) like I asked you to that's all yeah no I admit a opinion can't be wrong right all
(3:26:24) right it's opining all right let's ask the next question actually I got a quick question I uh asked about the microphone
(3:26:32) there so I noticed the sm7 uh B that you're using there Andrew uh did you find that you had to get the cloud
(3:26:38) lifter in order the to make that sound good or you just like running that right into uh right into a preamp because I I
(3:26:44) I found like I couldn't get enough juice to make the sm7b actually work for me
(3:26:50) quietly enough but yours yours sounds really good so I heard the cloudlifter helps a lot but uh I I just had to ask
(3:26:59) uh no I have a whole different requisite of settings a whole different requisite
(3:27:05) okay I mean this thing I'm using is like you know from the Elvis days it sucks I
(3:27:11) mean I yeah isn't it isn't it grimy I mean nobody's ever going to say my audio on The Crucible terrible no no no I mean
(3:27:18) people hear me and they wonder I mean I'm still using this because it is from 1953 it's kicking and I probably should
(3:27:26) run it through my uh my DAW and maybe drop some of the low end so I don't sound so grimy like I'm in a tin can ah
(3:27:34) but whatever guys we're having fun Speak Easy for all of this there you go
(3:27:41) go good J [ __ ] he's a piece of [ __ ] this guy I [ __ ] ha God damn garbage
(3:27:47) just the worst what the [ __ ] can't stand this guy you're no longer invited no I'm
(3:27:53) just kidding worse than any you're you're welcome back anytime I'm too polite to actually be mean for long term
(3:28:00) ah you bastard all right Airborne animal say their arguments all boil down to
(3:28:06) special pleading harm reduction fairness subject experience they all only matter
(3:28:12) when it is a trans identifying person not the normal person okay well I'm willing to engage with
(3:28:19) that all you have to do is look up special pleading they're incorrect again if it is the case that axioms are based
(3:28:25) on assumptions and it is the case that we're dealing with mind States then all of these things together would uh
(3:28:33) basically conclude that it's fine for me an internal critique to say if it is the case that you believe in utility as
(3:28:40) being kind of the maximum of what we should try to achieve that if we're comparing world views and I say mine is
(3:28:47) the dominant of the time and you say if you don't concede to my own X thing will
(3:28:53) happen it's on you to provide why that's maximum utility this is a basic internal
(3:28:59) critique there is no special pleading here at least not for me and Speak Easy I correct me if I'm wrong was that
(3:29:06) question saying that the conservatives were special pleading or with that I was special pleading well it that's kind of
(3:29:13) irrelevant we're just putting in why it would not be for me and Speak Easy special pleading it's up to you to argue
(3:29:19) your case for why it's not on your end it's true it's true sure I we want to go with that um I don't know how mine
(3:29:27) could be interpreted as special pleading it's it's not I I would love to talk to them more about that because I don't
(3:29:33) know how that could even be personably perceived um special pleading means this is special therefore it doesn't follow
(3:29:40) any of the other rules as anything else that is not what identity is identity is not what special pleading means
(3:29:47) all right let's ask the next question no no let's let's not uh can you look up what special pleading means special
(3:29:52) pleading means something no no I don't I don't want to hear your opinion just look up what special the rules of logic
(3:29:58) don't apply to no that's not what it means either no stop stop we got to get a point 30 seconds please look up what
(3:30:05) special pleading means and read out the definition for a person claims an exemption of a general or Universal
(3:30:12) principle but the exception is unjustified right so the the key point
(3:30:18) no it's not because the key Point here is unjustified you are trying to give justifications based on utilitarianism
(3:30:25) that would not be special pleading all right thanks fellas uh we're going to ask the next question Virginia redneck
(3:30:30) says if trans womenmen are womenmen why do you need to
(3:30:35) differentiate them with the prefix of trans shout out to Crucible and uh once
(3:30:41) again I will remind you that Andrew is going to be live at modern day debate uh debate con 5 it's going to be an
(3:30:49) absolute riot we're going to have a blast uh and and hopefully Andrew won't be sitting by himself before the end oh
(3:30:56) I can't hold but be fun uh with that but yeah no it'll be great uh listen listen
(3:31:01) I have booked half of that [ __ ] hotel I seriously doubt that I'm going to be sitting by myself no that's true enough
(3:31:08) that's true enough I just met for your debate partner I just I have to I have to pick I have to pick you know I can't
(3:31:15) help it you know oh you said about being a jerk I'm just one of those lowkey ones right like just mask it real good uh
(3:31:22) anyway I'm just I'm I am picking though uh it's it's going to be a great time uh Andrew is going to be there along with a
(3:31:28) lot of other great speakers um yeah no we do appreciate all the speakers that
(3:31:34) come out to uh to modern day debate uh but yeah if you haven't checked out the link in the description and uh seeing
(3:31:40) that we do have those tickets available for that live event if you're just tuning in now uh definitely check that
(3:31:46) out uh hit the like button if you haven't already uh and yeah yeah every
(3:31:52) little bit helps as as you heard earlier like I've already solicited James for beer and I think between me Andrew Alex
(3:32:00) and a few other people there's yeah that's going to be just a hefty B all on its own uh I mean we're we're
(3:32:07) problematic I think alog together all right so let's ask the next question
(3:32:12) Airborne animal says their argument boils yeah we as one sorry Alchemist says uh Andrew mentioned that he's a
(3:32:19) trump guy what are his thoughts on the executive order issued yesterday to criminalize anti-Semitism and his plans
(3:32:26) on bringing in the most H1 B1 chain migrators ever uh so one there was no
(3:32:34) there was no executive order for H1 B1 migrants one and two there was no anti-semitic bill which was actually
(3:32:41) formed into into an executive order AI chemist is just factually incorrect
(3:32:48) here that's that all right did we want to bounce
(3:32:53) that for any amount of time or are we just in more interested yeah does anybody have anything counter to that
(3:32:59) show me the executive order which illegalized anti-Semitism doesn't [ __ ] exist it just made
(3:33:05) up and by the way AI chemist I know I'm going to see you at this debate con you owe me a
(3:33:11) beer two beers and Speak Easy you owe Speak Easy a beer now too I know where I'm coming up with this but you do for
(3:33:17) some reason that I can't quite put my finger on but you do but I was just say what how wait no don't leave me out of
(3:33:24) this I was gonna say I got can you can you can you can you do it can you do the Irish Drinking are you gonna go out and
(3:33:30) do some Irish drinking with us bro is that going to happen what are you talking to me what
(3:33:36) do you mean by what do you mean by Irish Drinking do you mean like where we go and get like you don't know what Irish Drinking means then you've never done
(3:33:42) Irish Drinking I mean I I I mean I I just say it's it's kind of funny because I have new phander blood which is all
(3:33:49) Irish uh in nature but go ahead tell me tell me what uh tell me what that means in America well okay I'll do this in
(3:33:55) story form very quickly sure one time I was at a bar and it was an Irish bar and
(3:34:00) I asked for an Irish carbomb and she said that's horrible and racist because of you know the history of Ireland when
(3:34:07) it actually came to car bombs and she said how would it feel if I asked you if you wanted a 911 and I said it would
(3:34:14) feel fine I would just want to know what the the [ __ ] was in it and at that point she started to laugh and I felt like I won her over right I felt like I had won
(3:34:21) her over and then I said here's what's in a 911 it's two shots oh no to drink
(3:34:27) of water and then she really started laughing okay and I got a free Irish caromb I'm still happy about that to
(3:34:33) this day that's Irish Drinking if we're not debating why we're drinking we're not doing it right there you go I was
(3:34:42) going to say see you know most of the times that I go out uh I'm usually playing shows so you know they usually
(3:34:47) just Supply me for free so paying for drinks is uh is sometimes a foreign Affair especially with the local place
(3:34:54) um but anyway I won't get into that uh everybody's gonna be like Ryan you have a problem uh zorya mind says sport is
(3:35:02) fun an engaging dude to fairness of opportunity not outcome the leagues are
(3:35:08) then built upon that sport is fun and engaging due to fairness and of opportunity not outcome okay
(3:35:16) hold on a second here I mean I would agree with that sounds
(3:35:21) right oh there we go sorry I got distracted it was Jim Bob Jim Bob is
(3:35:27) distracting me anyways all right let's uh carry on uh by the way I unequivocally denounce Jim
(3:35:33) Bob as being the scumbag of the Universe I hate him in every capacity I possibly can I denounce him and his art it is
(3:35:41) transphobic homophobic it's every type of phobic and he glorifies iies people
(3:35:46) who should not be glorified uh he is the scumbag of our time and I really wish
(3:35:51) that modern day debate wouldn't associate with him I just can't believe you even do yeah smelly too um anyway uh
(3:35:58) let's carry on uh we're just picking thunderstorm I mean I am I don't know about Andrew I feel like you are though
(3:36:06) thunderstorm says the [ __ ] you feel like I smell what the [ __ ] what kind of [ __ ] is that what the [ __ ] kind of [ __ ] is
(3:36:13) that all right what what you I don't know I mean like I I was only like this close to you a few times I mean maybe
(3:36:21) I my sense of smell is not so great but uh no I was talking about Jim Bob but uh
(3:36:26) no no you guys uh that that is one thing I will vouch for that this time it got
(3:36:31) hot in the debate room so I don't know about you but I'm just going to advise people if you're booking a ticket like
(3:36:37) bring deodorant bring some hygienic supplies cuz at one point
(3:36:43) that room I think it was somewhere halfway between Destiny's debate our debate room was huming uh it was can I
(3:36:50) also Express that one time I personally witnessed in have video footage that Jim Bob just for fun captured fish on a
(3:36:58) great lake inside of Florida and fed them while they were still alive to an
(3:37:04) alligator for the purpose of his own personal Amusement what kind of [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] does
(3:37:11) that that's my question who captures fish right out of the water and then
(3:37:17) hand feeds them to an alligator for fun what kind of [ __ ] scumbag does that
(3:37:22) AB such a rich thing all right let's ask the next question all right thanks guys
(3:37:27) for having so much fun but yeah just that's uh that's a great call out that uh debate con is happening and we are
(3:37:33) gonna have a ball an absolute ball guys so uh Isa kir says come debate to debate
(3:37:38) conon 5 to see amazing debates like this it is going to be amazing uh let's see
(3:37:46) FB says uh we asked that one for pep talks he's gone now James life talk says
(3:37:52) uh also another one for pep talk sorry that uh that one was already read let's see Mitch G says if my eight-year-old
(3:37:58) consents to taking HRT while I and her doctor approve what is your issue it has
(3:38:04) nothing to do with you why be such a creep so that is a medical question and
(3:38:14) I do not have any medical training so you're going to have to refer to a medical experienced a a person who's an
(3:38:21) expert in medicine right a doctor and if the doctor does agree that it's true and
(3:38:26) you still feel a little suspicious and weird about it you should go get another opinion from another medical expert and
(3:38:32) you should do that enough times that you feel comfortable with the conclusion that you've come to hey Speak Easy if I
(3:38:38) had a open cut on my hand should I disinfect that with soap yes sir you're
(3:38:44) not a [ __ ] medical expert why don't you shut your [ __ ] mouth Speak Easy you're not a medical expert
(3:38:49) this is true so I I don't understand why you're telling why should I disinfect it Speak
(3:38:56) Easy what's the purpose of doctors Andrew what's the purpose of Debaters sir the purpose of a doctor is because
(3:39:01) medicine is not always intuitive right science is not always intuitive sometimes just because something feels
(3:39:07) right doesn't mean it is right always doing a lot of heavy lifting have you been watching a lot of Dr Gregory House
(3:39:13) sir if I had a big open cut on my hand do you think I should disinfect it I
(3:39:20) don't know how that's relevant to this question can you answer my question please if you have a big cut how do I
(3:39:26) know to disinfect it should I disinfect it sure yeah the difference I don't
(3:39:31) understand you're not a medical [ __ ] expert stop telling me things you're not a medical expert sir some medicine is
(3:39:37) very unintuitive just cuz you feel like it's icky or wrong or disagrees with your what I'm trying yeah what I'm
(3:39:43) trying to get at is in the future instead of I'm not a medical expert because there's plenty of things which
(3:39:48) you have medical expertise on like how to treat a basic wound just say I don't know I said I said I you tried to do
(3:39:57) this elongated liberal shill [ __ ] where you're like well because due to the fact that I'm not a medical expert
(3:40:02) and there's a high degree of uncertainty inside of the frame of this particular
(3:40:08) it's like just H hang on say the truth just say well are you then just say the
(3:40:14) truth yeah they are then just say the truth I don't know that's what I said and I gave them guid on how to find a
(3:40:19) valuable answer then say it I did I don't know reference an expert what I said that was my answer no that wasn't
(3:40:26) your answer your answer was an elongated bloviated [ __ ] yeah because I guide find a valuable answer just say in the
(3:40:33) future I don't know no because that wouldn't give them guidance on a valuable answer yeah you don't know what a valuable answer is yeah it's talking
(3:40:40) who are familiar with subject it's talking who are familiar with the subject AR entertaining but we do have a
(3:40:46) lot of questions I I yes okay so easy uh we
(3:40:53) have so many questions you guys are having too much fun here and if you're having fun at modern day debate smash
(3:40:58) the like button support what we do uh we still have lots of people watching live in the chat right now and uh yeah we do
(3:41:05) hope to see you there at the debate con it's going to be an amazing time and uh
(3:41:12) yeah yeah no I'm I'm that sounds like a Vibe of a party debate con I wish I was in a closer State cuz that place is
(3:41:18) going to be Bing just fly out bro yeah it's a bunch of people who are just dedicated to having a good time like you
(3:41:25) we want to have a good time come on you want to go have a beer you know you want to go have a beer right I would have fun
(3:41:30) he does yeah see you want to go have a beer see it in his eyes you yeah I was going to say uh some big nasty IPA I can
(3:41:38) I can see it uh no I'm not conservative enough for that I was going to say uh
(3:41:45) now last year though when I hosted iron raw and Stuart necky I think I had like a four leader of beer that debate like
(3:41:52) that was that was just crazy and it was like all 8% like I I went to bed and I woke up like two days later I swear it
(3:42:00) was wild all right yandu asks question uh if the ship is going down should
(3:42:06) trans women be allowed on the rescue boats first along with the women and children or wait with the men
(3:42:13) why a great question
(3:42:18) so I believe I
(3:42:24) mean so who should leave the boat first is about who can't help other people who
(3:42:30) are leaving behind people who should be left behind are people who can help other people and if that's a woman then
(3:42:36) they should be left behind to help other people if you have a really Macho Butch strong woman who can help carry weak
(3:42:43) liberal men down the stairs or whatever then they should be there to help them and it it it isn't a again it's just
(3:42:51) like with sports there are metrics that can help decide who should be in what situation that are much more valuable
(3:42:57) than gender so when the boat is sinking they should be okay wait let's step on the scale we're going to see if you're
(3:43:03) getting in the Lifeboat how about or or you could be like hey whoever can help it's not because men are more likely to survive
(3:43:09) the boat going down not because they're more likely to be able to help what do you mean they're more likely to survive
(3:43:14) the boat more likely to be able to survive how because of the biology how
(3:43:20) what what biology these things before bone density the way their hips are shaped it even makes them their grip
(3:43:27) strength uh the muscle mass all these things are going to help for their exactly right those are the things we
(3:43:33) should identify and help those so you're saying we should make them while the boat is going down make them all step on
(3:43:38) a scale well the quick the quick way would be world you're trying to live in the quick way would be for anyone thinks
(3:43:45) they can help they should stay back it doesn't matter what gender you
(3:43:50) are it's an easy answer and it's more way more useful than gender is so all right let's ask the next question and uh
(3:43:58) yeah thanks to anathema for hanging out in the live chat and uh taking care of
(3:44:04) some of the chats that are a little unorderly we want to keep it as friendly as we can guys uh but I haven't seen too
(3:44:10) much policing going on in the chat so I mean I really shouldn't uh say too much but I do want to I don't know I don't know The Crucible
(3:44:16) is saying that modern day debate is bias towards it chat they're saying that the
(3:44:21) mods over there are Banning them indiscriminately you SC I'm kidding the bias is towards the chat I'm totally I'm
(3:44:27) totally joking stop being conservative [ __ ] mod debate all right I'm gonna
(3:44:35) clip that clip that stop all right no no I won't I won't
(3:44:40) [ __ ] no no no everybody's great uh you guys are uh doing everything you can
(3:44:46) to try to keep things friendly we want to remind people to attack the arguments not the speakers on screen uh we
(3:44:51) appreciate our speakers life blood of the CH unless you can attack him Unleash
(3:44:57) Your hatred yes yes become a Sith for Speak Easy guys that is not the proper
(3:45:02) Sith voice you scum back you have to you have to no you're
(3:45:08) wrong no has to beerly yes yes destroy
(3:45:13) Speak Easy destroy oh which makes yes there we go now we're
(3:45:19) getting somewhere now we're getting to your anger I I've see my kids are asleep though Andrew I got to be quiet I can't
(3:45:27) all of wit is Speak Easy destroy his septum piercing destroy his goat hat
(3:45:33) make it part of the Republic which will now be under the Empire that's the way

(3:46:12) couple weeks back it cost me 2,000 bucks I you can actually play oh yeah let's

(3:50:19) hear you now I got to plug back in okay all right what's up I'm gonna fly out my friend Chase Haggard just because of how
(3:50:25) much of a humbling experience that'll be for you that's why I'm doing it I'm only doing it to watch him humble you that's
(3:50:32) the only reason I'm doing it I I know somebody's going to send this to chase Haggard tomorrow he's going to come out
(3:50:39) I'm paying for it just to watch him [ __ ] humble you for no good reason other than I can
(3:50:45) oh well that's great I I would love I'd love to have some other guitar players there one of the things that I I would
(3:50:51) say that uh was a regret last time when I was in Texas is that I didn't go and see the S the Stevie Ravon and the Buddy
(3:50:58) Holly uh statue that was there um so you know uh if I could find a way to get to
(3:51:06) a music store in New Jersey before I leave that would be great or run into some other musical people uh that would
(3:51:12) be fun but uh yeah if you're hanging out on YouTube if you check my page yeah I do I I I do a mean I I do a lot of mean
(3:51:20) lead Zeppelin covers I'm not going to lie I'll tell my own horn so we're going to get of Music mode uh this was all in
(3:51:27) promotion of debate con 5 I swear I swear all right it wasn't in the side
(3:51:34) yeah but honestly it's it's it's it's fun to reset the tone every once in a while just hang out and uh yeah some
(3:51:40) tangents are necessary exactly it's it's never seen you do that before and I've watched a
(3:51:46) lot of your posted no I don't think I've ever picked up uh the guitar halfway through there's
(3:51:54) been a few times that I've played the guitar uh for the intro I used to have a backing track that I would play uh that
(3:52:00) would Loop and then I would play uh a solo over top just like an improv and then I'd hang up the guitar I I just
(3:52:06) thought it was a nice thing to do uh live since we were modern day debate live but yeah no I'm not going to do any
(3:52:14) of that unve malmstein stuff right now no no sweeps can you even sweep bro all
(3:52:19) right no more sides damn it Andrew why you should play at you should play at
(3:52:24) the event though even Lord says uh to quote Craig uh yeah we had that one ah
(3:52:31) now see I got a scroll uh let's see CDI for will should
(3:52:36) a transwoman breastfeed their child right back into it that's a great
(3:52:43) question will should they if your objective is to feed your child then probably not right I don't know will
(3:52:51) you're not a medical expert I don't know how you're making all of these you're right go ask a doctor yeah what do you
(3:52:56) think a doctor would say though will uh if your goal is to feed them then probably not yeah yeah probably not
(3:53:02) because you're not a woman because your breast don't produce food is the you're
(3:53:07) because you're not a woman what is a woman Andrew a woman would be a biological human
(3:53:12) female oh you keep pushing it on the female definition which is the sex typically associated with giving birth
(3:53:18) is that what you normally say well no I would I would say that the uh not only
(3:53:24) the phenotypical expression but the leadup to it which would be your biological uh aeration of the pathway to
(3:53:32) sex would be that you were either a capable of giving birth or you were on
(3:53:40) the reproductive Pathway to do so the reproductive path way well yeah sure like for instance if a woman is
(3:53:47) born without ovaries we still know she should have had them yeah well I mean should have it's you're
(3:53:55) loading the question there no it's not what LO she doesn't need she doesn't need ovaries to be a woman true she
(3:54:01) doesn't need she doesn't even need to be how would we ascertain that she was a woman well it depends on what you mean
(3:54:07) by woman because if you're talking about their identity that's one way well it depends on what you mean by female if
(3:54:12) you mean okay well do you think a female is well females you're usually having
(3:54:18) physical characteristics that are associated with no not just physical characteristics there's something else
(3:54:24) there what is it uh no there what is the one sex which
(3:54:29) is able to carry children that's a physical characteristic yeah what is the one sex
(3:54:36) which is capable of that physical characteristics can any male give birth
(3:54:41) any any male give birth any male give birth that is not trait
(3:54:47) associated with being a male can any male give birth that's not a trait that
(3:54:52) can any male give birth can any male give birth unless you want to change the
(3:54:58) definition of male no okay so then associating reproduction with female
(3:55:05) makes sense because no male can give birth right can any male have XY
(3:55:10) chromosomes or any male have XX chromosomes yes so there's more than one factor in play here right nobody
(3:55:17) disputed that but here's my dispute and any male give birth can any male give birth
(3:55:25) any any can any male give birth any male
(3:55:31) give birth can they or not so the can male give birth or not
(3:55:40) sir so the re my this is my you answer yes or no it's not a yes or no question
(3:55:45) it's a is that not a [ __ ] yes or no question your question the way I think is answer your [ __ ] question okay can
(3:55:52) any male give birth chill can any male give birth sex can any male give birth
(3:55:57) is a spectrum can any male give birth someone on and any male give birth I I'm
(3:56:03) not gonna continue this yeah you're not gonna I'm willing to explain it interrupting me if you're going to keep
(3:56:09) interrupting me I'm not well dude I just need an answer all right let's this is
(3:56:14) I can't answer can a male give birth what
(3:56:21) you answer the question can any star explode so this en star can any star
(3:56:29) explode can any star explode Yeah question explode is there a single
(3:56:36) star I want to talk about males which is the can any can any star explode can can
(3:56:41) I have a moment can any Star exp can you control I'll tell I'll tell you what I will do
(3:56:46) this I will literally I'll tell you I'll make a deal I'll Make A Deal hang on I'll make a deal with you I will
(3:56:51) literally answer yes or no to all of your subsequent questions that you ask me after I ask you these and you answer
(3:56:57) yes or no that seems totally fair I don't care about you answer yes or no can any Star explod can any star
(3:57:05) explode I don't care about you answering yes or no could our sun can our could our sun explode yeah okay could any Star
(3:57:13) which is like Caron explode I mean the answer is no cuz some
(3:57:18) STS aren't made to explode or they already exploded wait wait hold on to be fair I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm I'm now I
(3:57:26) am actually confused yeah a brown a brown there are stars out there which cannot explode really yeah because once
(3:57:34) our star quotequote does explode it's going to be reduced to a drawn brown dwarf which after it exploded yes yeah
(3:57:41) so any Star can explode though not a brown dwarf that's not a
(3:57:47) star oh oh look we're we're discussing the fundamental axioms of the question wow that's exactly what I was about to
(3:57:53) do with the male so can can any can any star explode no I already said that no what
(3:58:00) what what star can't explode a brown dwarf is that a star yeah what makes it
(3:58:07) a star we could really talk about this what's the difference between a star and
(3:58:12) a black hole and a very large planet star is usually associated with a lot of
(3:58:17) fusion going on them that fuels them and is fueled by the gravitational force is a is a brown dwarf is a brown dwarf
(3:58:23) usually come from a star which exploded yeah oh okay so any of these stars in
(3:58:29) the classification of the things which make the brown dwarf can they explode I think so yeah oh okay great can any man
(3:58:36) give birth so let's talk about it right yeah let's talk about I I I honestly
(3:58:41) love what you just did because you just showed how questions like that are more nuanced than just a yes or no I love
(3:58:48) that you love that you just did that so now let's let's get into it right okay let's get into can any male give birth
(3:58:54) it depends on what you are trying to talk about when you say male because male is a spectrum you can be less male
(3:59:00) and you can be more male can be less female and you I'm just going to Grant I'm going to Grant literally all of this
(3:59:06) can any male give birth um you could say yes okay which
(3:59:12) ones if you want to male by saying um
(3:59:17) the hormone composition of a person hang on hang on I just want I just want to stop right there there are
(3:59:23) males which you think can give birth I just want that on record it's how you
(3:59:29) define male yeah I know I know but you think males can give birth correct if you want
(3:59:38) to label someone a male you can do it but it's how you define the word that's
(3:59:43) the nuance can you define male without using female in order to Define how a male could give
(3:59:49) birth can I define male without using female yeah without using what you would
(3:59:55) consider to be biological female for giving birth let's say uhhuh if the only sex characteristic that you're going to
(4:00:01) use to gauge the sex of a person is their hormones and you said this person has a lot of testosterone I'm going to
(4:00:08) call them a male sure then you're calling them a male what do you consider a male to be
(4:00:14) it's it's complicated it's more of where are they on the a just for sex for sex no don't but sex is a spectrum okay
(4:00:22) agreed then I'll just concede sex is a spectrum and everything you consider
(4:00:28) males a spectrum can any of those males which are classified by you give birth
(4:00:33) if you want to defi if you want however you define it can any male by how you
(4:00:38) define it give birth or not sir if you define it to be then it would be you
(4:00:45) you will the guy I'm debating not some guy over there named Fred will can a
(4:00:51) maale anywhere by your definition give [ __ ] birth or
(4:00:57) not it it it's it's will your question is overi can any male by your definition
(4:01:03) of what a male is give birth or not you can whatever your definition is you can
(4:01:09) I'll give you the Nuance you can be on the male Spectrum okay you can be on the
(4:01:15) I don't I don't care yes or no simple question on the M Spectrum there's nothing loaded about this question Z
(4:01:21) loaded there's zero loaded there's nothing loaded can any male by Will's definition give birth any mail by your
(4:01:28) definition can any mail by Will's definition not loaded give birth yes or
(4:01:40) no I would probably I would say probably
(4:01:48) not oh with the Heron is just up and out but that's very much ignoring all of the
(4:01:55) Nuance that needs to be accounted for when discussing anatomical sex because you can be on the male side of the
(4:02:01) spectrum and still have birthing capabilities right you could have male a
(4:02:06) male quantity of hormones you could have a male bone structure you could have
(4:02:12) many male characteristics that can exist on your body so you would potentially
(4:02:17) categorize them as male while still potentially having female reproductive
(4:02:22) organs right that is possible and if you want to call them a male because they happen to have male characteristics you
(4:02:29) could identify it as a male who has the ability to give birth you could I probably wouldn't Define it that way but
(4:02:35) you could and it's it's really coming down to an opinion-based question all right let's uh and in your opinion no
(4:02:42) males can give birth right I said probably not well what does that mean probably I
(4:02:50) already said prob you think do you think that some males wa wait wait will will probably you mean bro you think some
(4:02:57) males can give birth will I say if you if you want to say if
(4:03:02) the person is anywhere will you will you will will the person will do you think any male anywhere can give birth will do
(4:03:10) you will think a male okay you think m can give birth in very very very uncommon
(4:03:18) situations can you tell me one of those uncommon situations yeah I will I will okay a uncommon situation where you
(4:03:23) could say a male can give birth is when if you want to say there's a spectrum right there's a male spectrum and a
(4:03:29) female Spectrum if you want to say what will says okay if I want no you said could it
(4:03:35) ever happen ever you will will I'm asking will the guy I'm talking to will
(4:03:41) okay hang on hang on let me let me let me just the question so that you understand so there's no possibility of
(4:03:48) you not being able to clarify this you will guy I'm talking to guy whose opinion that I'm addressing guy whose
(4:03:55) arguments I'm talking to you will not some other guy who's not will not anybody who's not will not any
(4:04:02) Collective of people whose names are not will will is there any male on planet
(4:04:08) Earth which can give birth will will yeah okay can you tell me who that could be yeah yeah yeah
(4:04:14) so I can me will the person you're addressing the question to I could say
(4:04:20) if you're on the male side of the SP at all do you say that I could no not could
(4:04:26) do you
(4:04:32) no see remember at the beginning when I said now will will does will will the
(4:04:41) person I'm speaking to do you think a single male on planet Earth can give birth do you will not guy over there not
(4:04:50) the moderator not speak easy not Fred not Chuck not James not anybody else do
(4:04:55) you will think any man on planet Earth can give birth any maale I I already said yes
(4:05:02) okay now will i' would like you to demonstrate from will Will's perspective
(4:05:08) not if you but from Will's perspective will what male can give birth okay I
(4:05:13) will Define that okay a male can give birth if a if you're in the situation
(4:05:21) where they have all male characteristics that are associated with that sex except the reproductive
(4:05:28) organs right what what reproductive or all male
(4:05:35) characteristics that make up a male sex that's many different things it could be your bone structure it could be your
(4:05:41) hormone your hormone makeup it could be many many different things that make up your sex have all you have all of it but
(4:05:48) you also so you have ovaries in a reproductive Canal you vagina but in contrast you have a female reproductive
(4:05:55) system you could have both right so you can be a male both and have a female
(4:06:00) reproductive system yeah that's that did you listen to my intro that's the whole point I am so confused can you show me
(4:06:07) any males that have a female reproductive system that it I mean that's what lots
(4:06:15) of trans people can be that can trans people are males who have a female reproductive system I said that's what
(4:06:21) trans people can be that's what I said well how could How could a trans person be a male and have her female
(4:06:27) reproductive system well because they could have all other male characteristics right so what is the
(4:06:33) difference between that and being a really ugly
(4:06:39) woman well that's your op you don't know what is the difference between op of a
(4:06:46) fale who's really ugly and you think she's a male but has the reproductive
(4:06:52) characteristics well what is it what is the difference I just doesn't seem like a
(4:06:58) good faith argument right it it doesn't it doesn't seem like a good faith argument even though I didn't make an
(4:07:04) argument I asked you a question good faith question so will if you're really really really ugly woman that people
(4:07:10) look at and think you're a man but you have the reproductive system of a female what makes you a
(4:07:16) male well I don't Define males as being ugly women that's a very weird yeah
(4:07:22) that's not my question can you repeat my question to me your question was I I think I'm you don't know what my
(4:07:29) question was you can't repeat it to me you want me to tell you it again will silly questions can I can I ask you
(4:07:34) again so you can't repeat it I I'm not interested in it you're not now you're not interested will yes now now you have
(4:07:41) no interest yeah question I do have a question here uh for Andrew now uh I I
(4:07:48) had a couple people after after you easily convinced me I
(4:07:53) mean twisting my Rubber Arm to uh play a tune live but I had to play something not copyright so I played some classical
(4:08:00) [ __ ] because Zeppelin is very copyright but uh I'll let you know uh I I I can
(4:08:06) send you some cashme there Andrew if you want to pass it along to whoever's uh you said there's does that go something
(4:08:12) like [Music] that's black dog what does cashmir do
(4:08:20) what does got but you can only do it in bums listen many people do do's and they
(4:08:25) do Daws and they do bees and they do bows I want to hear
(4:08:31) only so that's what I want to hear can't hear it bro we can't hear it
(4:08:38) we can't hear it through the mic bro we can't hear it that's terrible I can't I can't believe you can't hear that
(4:08:45) yeah I say I won't bother you guys have fun on your own but either way that's cashmir is the uh C cashmir is like a
(4:08:53) mysterious sounding tune that most people who play acoustic guitar if you got a guy that comes out and plays acoustic then uh is
(4:09:07) that yeah I I can do that on my acoustic you can't do it on yours I mean I mean I
(4:09:13) it's not tuned for it right now it's not in back I'm just playing with you bro go ahead go ahead oh man either way you
(4:09:18) know you got me all excited now you're you know I I as far as I know there are no other musical people that are making
(4:09:24) their way out uh to the debate con so yeah way to way to get me all razzled up
(4:09:30) but yeah I can't I can't share any Zeppelin live I'll send you an email all right I'll send you this the cashmere
(4:09:36) okay that's right send me the cash yeah yeah all right you you hand it along I'm counting on you all right Jason C
(4:09:44) people are being forced to affirm trans ideology this is a $50 Super Chat so
(4:09:49) we're going to spend some time with this people are being forced to affirm trans ideology people have been fired for
(4:09:56) using the wrong pronouns people have been attacked for using the wrong pronouns people have been arrested for
(4:10:03) using the wrong pronouns how is this not
(4:10:09) force I mean I don't know you're talking about being arrested for using the wrong person that honestly sounds like a
(4:10:14) fictional statement I've never heard of that and I think you probably just either made that up or learned it from a
(4:10:20) misinformation website um private companies are allowed to fire
(4:10:26) people who they want to fire I'm not forcing them I'm not telling anybody to force them if they choose to uphold a
(4:10:33) certain ethical standard and that includes affirming transgender identities then that's their choice and
(4:10:40) that's not okay with them discriminating transgenders as well then
(4:10:47) right that's their choice you should be okay with that no I'm not okay with that
(4:10:52) oh so what's your reasoning because transgender people exist cool but you literally just said
(4:11:00) that if a private company wants to have a certain ethical standard with their company then that's their choosing yes
(4:11:08) but transgender people if company wants an ethical standard of no transgenders
(4:11:13) yes if if you want to start talking about people's ethical ethical standards and how they correspond with no reality
(4:11:22) I want to know why you have this contradiction that's what I was about to say if you let me speak if you want to
(4:11:28) disregard people didn't ask okay if you want to uphold an ethical standard that
(4:11:33) is congruent with reality I'm willing to defend that but if you're e ethical standard is based on disrespecting
(4:11:39) people for having a personal opinion if you want to have eth stand that's
(4:11:45) congruent with reality of only man and woman then yeah you can work for me but
(4:11:50) if but that's not reality gend on a spectrum then you can't what's wrong with that because one of those was not
(4:11:58) real based on your opinion op and you said any of our opinions in our head is
(4:12:04) true based on the definitions of the Words Right male and female have many
(4:12:10) different contributing factors to their definition yeah and you can't adult female
(4:12:17) human oh look you put it on the word female again wow no you just said definitions are important so I just
(4:12:24) bring you the definition of woman do you think that was a good definition you jump in all you contradict yourself
(4:12:30) every every turn do you think do you think the word female is a good definition for the word woman is that like a fully satisfying definition adult
(4:12:36) human female yes yes okay well that's not a good definition right why because
(4:12:41) obviously you now need to expl what the word female is because you're just explaining one word with another
(4:12:47) word wouldn't that be the counter wouldn't that be the very same counter argument you just explain one word with another word but the the question the
(4:12:55) question when we make a reference to a definition is it does that definition give us you know uh some type of
(4:13:02) information which is not regressive to that definition so if the Defan by the
(4:13:08) way of woman is female and it is the defin n um basically the root is showing
(4:13:15) us what woman means all referent to woman at least in every society that I
(4:13:20) can adhere to whether it be muhair in Spanish all the way over to whatever is
(4:13:27) definitely describing the female reproductive phenotype and the inyp as
(4:13:35) being look at that as detail yeah of course but but the thing is it's like you can get as detail as you want you'll
(4:13:42) end up in a I won't all right let's ask the next Super would you like to try like we can
(4:13:47) demonstrate it would you like to demonstrate how you will end up in a regress and I
(4:13:53) won't I I don't know what you mean an infinite regress you think a woman is
(4:13:58) who thinks they're a woman I think a woman is pointing to indicators of things which are external which would be
(4:14:05) true regardless over simplified it you've already oversimplified I already oversimplified it you've already oversimplified it because you said I
(4:14:11) think woman is person who thinks they're woman no that's not true I what do you think a woman is I believe a woman has
(4:14:19) multiple contexts that need to be explained for it to be fully understood does it rely on
(4:14:25) belief there is a context that does bel what context do you believe a woman is a
(4:14:30) woman that does not rely on belief the context of gender expression right does
(4:14:35) not rely on belief no because it relies on the cultures perception of that so
(4:14:42) that that would would then mean that if I carried a purse I was a woman so that would be
(4:14:47) a gen that would a be a character that is associated with women okay that's
(4:14:54) fair how many characteristics do I need to have before I was golden question the golden question so that is what a
(4:15:01) spectrum is right there isn't a on the Spectrum do I fuing work let me cook
(4:15:09) here for a second I can't wait there Spectrum a spectrum is a spectrum means that there isn't a part on it
(4:15:16) where you all of a sudden click and you become a woman you just you are confused my man you're both
(4:15:23) all the time so are you so are does a spectrum mean you're both all the time so a spectrum is so first of all the
(4:15:31) spectrum of male is separate from the spectrum of female right you can be
(4:15:36) somewhere on the spectrum of male and you could also be on the spectrum of female or you could be on neither or you
(4:15:41) could be on one or the other or you could be on completely different one I think that's that's fair what does the word more
(4:15:47) mean what so are we talking about Identity or we talking about no I'm just asking you what the word more means well
(4:15:53) it depends oh my god do you think that more depends on what what does more depend on just fundamentally the word
(4:15:59) more or Rel what fundamentally what does the word more mean a greater amount oh
(4:16:05) and what does less mean a smaller amount so if I had a greater amount of X thing in this case
(4:16:11) male characteristics how come I'm not a male a greater amount of X things because you're you have a you are more
(4:16:20) you you're sliding down the male Spectra that's what you're doing so if I have more characteristics of a male than a
(4:16:25) female how come I'm not a male because you'll slide more down the male Spectra that's what how come I'm not a male
(4:16:31) because there isn't a definitive moment where you do become it sounds like a [ __ ] belief all right we're going to
(4:16:37) ask the next question sounds like a believe let's ask the next question guys oh so if I have more m characteristics
(4:16:43) in female I'm still not a male you are more on that male Spectra
(4:16:49) that's am I a male you see this is what I mean when you oversimplify guys have
(4:16:54) to put over simplify know I'm oversimplify already assuming a binary
(4:17:01) and it's there's only a binary because it's not a binary where's and that's the part of the debate where's the third sex
(4:17:07) me and Speak Easy just hanging out if there's no third sex and there's only two Sexes which makes it a binary so if
(4:17:13) I have more more male characteristics sir than female how come I'm not a male
(4:17:18) you're confused again you're confused it's okay it's okay to be confused it's okay I'll explain I'll expl tell me about binary binary means there's two
(4:17:25) options right oh there's only two that that's what a binary means is that not you agree okay okay when it comes to sex
(4:17:33) there are not only two options oh how many options are there that a Spectra of options oh well uh when do I become a
(4:17:41) too good where on the Spectrum do I become it's like you're asking me let me let me give it an analogy it's like
(4:17:47) you're asking me what part of the color spectrum does something become the color red that's what you're asking we can use
(4:17:52) a spectrometer to determine that would you like me to demonstrate actually we can would you like me to demonstrate you
(4:17:58) think the color red is one objective number no I think on a color spectrometer though we can determine
(4:18:04) when red becomes something that's not red no you can't because the whole point is there's an infinite number of colors
(4:18:10) within the Spectra that is correlated so we're to the arrow in Flight we can never determine when an arrow Hits the
(4:18:16) Target because it's always technically in Flight that's what a Spectra is oh I see so in this case we can never
(4:18:23) determine what is male or female you can say you're closer on the male Spectra that's what you can say and that is the
(4:18:29) most accurate and useful way to describe it really why is that more accurate than who can readed with who because that's
(4:18:36) just one characteristic and there's other characteristic that's only one characteristic why can't I use that as
(4:18:41) why why can't I corate there's other characteristics that are corresponding with sex why more
(4:18:48) well I've I've explained them how many times six times I've explained there can be physical characteristics such as
(4:18:54) chromosomes right there can be genitalia structure there can be bone structure there can be hormonal makeup Etc there
(4:19:02) is a plethora of different that's you know what I'm going to Grant all of those that's totally fair can anybody be
(4:19:08) anything other than male male or female and if they can be tell me what that sex
(4:19:16) is I don't have no so so you're
(4:19:21) assuming wait wait wait wait wait wait wait let me let me let's stop laughing let's that's really disres that's really
(4:19:28) disrespectful okay thank you so I do not need to show you a third axis to prove
(4:19:34) it's not a binary oh what is a binary a binary means there's two options and if
(4:19:40) there was three there wouldn't be a binary right if there's if if there's three it wouldn't be a binary that's
(4:19:45) true yeah so then can you show me where the third is it's everywhere on the Spectrum oh where right there's multiple
(4:19:52) Spectrum okay you could be neither yeah can you show me where on the spectrum that would be on the low end of the SP
(4:20:00) where is that ah let me go ahead and share my screen real quick okay share your screen I can't wait to see because
(4:20:06) this gender bred person emphasis on person um is a very useful tool oh wait
(4:20:12) there what is this all right
(4:20:17) so oh the genderbread person again okay right gender of person so anatomical we're really focused on this anatomical
(4:20:24) sex category here right now right and you can be somewhere over here on the male side or you could be somewhere here
(4:20:31) on the female side yeah where's that though what do you mean where's that like where is that how many characteristics add up to this versus
(4:20:38) that and that's where subjectivity starts coming into play oh so you can't actually tell me when where one stops
(4:20:44) and one begins because there's only two binaries well no it's not two binaries it's two Spectra oh very different that
(4:20:51) is the reason there are more than one gender is because it's a Spectra not a binary Spectra means there's an infinite
(4:20:57) number can a dog be a cat that is a completely unrelated that is called a nony can a dog can can a dog be a cat
(4:21:05) not aacy it's a question so can can can a dog be a cat now you have me questioning can a dog be a cat yeah uh
(4:21:14) well it's not related can yeah so anyway so can a dog be a cat though just just
(4:21:19) unrelated to this yeah can a dog be a cat um it depends on what you mean by
(4:21:25) dog and cat could dogs have catlike character whatever you consider a dog to be I have a dog can a cat be that
(4:21:33) thing uh I could say a cat has dog characteristics and you see this is what
(4:21:38) we're doing again you're you're exemplifying perfectly again in oversimplification of a complicated of a
(4:21:45) complex nuanced structure right can a dog be a cat normally everyone's going to be like no well what if every single
(4:21:52) part of this animal looks exactly like a dog yeah except it has
(4:21:57) the that's that's my point what defines dog yeah so so question oh okay well I
(4:22:05) think that that's a fair question let's look to the laws of logic can you read for me what the law of identity
(4:22:11) States I I'd rather you just uh no I I really want you to read what the law of
(4:22:16) identity States please I'm not gonna play your game you're not gonna pull up the law ofid no you're no okay so we're not
(4:22:24) debating anymore then oh I'm totally willing to debate you so so I would pull up any definition you wanted why would
(4:22:30) you not do me the same favor can you just pull up what the law of can you just pull up what the law of identity
(4:22:36) means can you pull it up please okay but this doesn't mean you're in charge I didn't say I was in charge
(4:22:43) bro we're having a debate I know I'm just joking just tell me what the law of identity just for
(4:22:50) you something is identical to itself X is X right okay if x was y it couldn't
(4:22:57) be X could it that's I wouldn't uh if x was y could
(4:23:03) it be X it could be well then you have violated the fundamental law of identity
(4:23:09) well I mean so all of your all of your wait bro can X be Y and still be X I
(4:23:19) mean it depends on how you no it can't depend you violated the law of identity said this now is incoherent can X be y
(4:23:28) or must it be X I think I need to understand the context of what you mean by you don't
(4:23:34) know the [ __ ] law what of the three law hang on stop let's start with this what are the three laws of logic what are they no no no don't look them up
(4:23:40) what are the three laws of logic do you think this is an Inc the three laws of logic there's three what are they I
(4:23:47) don't [ __ ] know you don't know the [ __ ] laws of log dude no all right dude I don't know where you don't even
(4:23:52) know the three laws of Li this is [ __ ] crazy you're [ __ ] czy you do you want to speak easy if he
(4:23:59) knows yeah it's the law of identity the law of non-contradiction and the the law
(4:24:04) of the excluded middle anything else BP [ __ ] oh dude you you [ __ ] really got
(4:24:10) him on that one you [ __ ] stupid
(4:24:17) [ __ ] all right let's move on to the next question um oh my I don't know if Andrew's broken
(4:24:26) if you want to explain why that's to the debate [ __ ]
(4:24:31) wild whole life whole life you thinkal y
(4:24:36) is be able to function if do you thinkal y an incomprehensible
(4:24:43) mathematical statement that happens all of the time in math oh really show me what yeah it does yeah show me where
(4:24:49) show me show me where number's value is never value if xals 2 and Y equals 2
(4:24:55) then x equals y doesn't it oh wait it kind does doesn't it so wait a second so if the same value equals the same value
(4:25:01) is the same value oh I never thought of that before wait wait wait wait did we just that xal y did we just establish
(4:25:08) that X can equal y your whole your whole we all we establish is that X can equal x
(4:25:14) stupid no you I just told you X can equal y mathematically true guys all right
(4:25:22) hold on okay hang on hang on is two a value hang on hang on well we'll just demonstrate it is two a value 30 seconds
(4:25:28) I don't want to but we do have to move on sure okay great can two be three no
(4:25:35) okay well then that's the end of that all right and look at us defining our terms making things
(4:25:41) clear I love we do need we do need to thank you so much Speak Easy what are
(4:25:47) the laws of logic he gives over to the guys like all right let's move on Doctrine
(4:25:55) matters uh we like I say we are just a little over halfway like we're two hours
(4:26:01) my shiny translucent ARS what I can't [ __ ] believe that that just happened Speak Easy did that just happen 100%
(4:26:10) what hold on earlier didn't I say Andrew I was going to try to keep this to under like I got the hiccups cuz I've been
(4:26:16) drinking shut up mod shut up I have the I have the hiccups cuz I've been drinking I didn't say anything about your hiccups you're allowed to hiccup
(4:26:22) you were thinking about it you were thinking about it was I did you catch me did you catch me burping at some point
(4:26:28) you're you might be projecting right now it's okay A little bit a little bit you're watching all right stop looking
(4:26:34) at me all right you're making me conscious all right Doctrine matter says uh Andrew when Andrew can you prove the
(4:26:41) Jesus taught and apost apostles followed the idea that lying to save oneself or
(4:26:47) another is biblical when did Jesus or the apostles lie to save themselves or
(4:26:54) another well whether they did or or they didn't has nothing to do with the argument here from the internal
(4:27:00) criticism of utilitarianism all right let's move on
(4:27:05) from there uh we're going to try to bust through and do some of these super chats real quick and get these speakers out of
(4:27:11) here uh so that they can arrest and uh so can I cuz uh from what I know there's
(4:27:17) going to be more snow tomorrow and that just means more work for me uh it's fun
(4:27:23) all right so CDI uh we got that one trainer TIG uh says you want the
(4:27:28) authority of science to make metaphysical claims saying that science reveals gender identity to be uh innate
(4:27:34) at the same time insisting that people are free to be who they want to
(4:27:40) be any thoughts there will that gender equ sorry can you repeat that one
(4:27:47) more time you want the authority of science to make metaphysical claims saying that science reveals gender
(4:27:52) identity to be innate at the same time insisting that people are free to be who
(4:27:58) they want to be well gender identity isn't innate it's an opinion that you
(4:28:03) established in your mind so I don't I don't think that you're trying to make it sound
(4:28:09) more um objective than it really is it's more of a subjective concept of the way you perceive gender and the way you
(4:28:15) perceive yourself all right let's keep this going uh Jesus martinz says Andrew
(4:28:21) ma'am would you fight against a female MMA sure [ __ ]
(4:28:29) them come in full swing they hey hey they they wanted equal rights absolutely
(4:28:34) break that chick's jaw in a second happily do it got a woman beater in the house hey hey wait a second wait wait
(4:28:42) wait wait a second you mean if she identified as a male P find a punch her
(4:28:47) in the face right yeah that's right anyway will John
(4:28:54) Bert says will excuse me see now I'm doing it damn
(4:28:59) it all right John Bert will can you please get in your custom red
(4:29:06) Crystal what is this all about is the inside joke okay I don't know no it's
(4:29:12) not it's not an inside Joe this is a this is a very real phenomenon I am told
(4:29:18) that Liberals are being stuffed into crystals it sounds like a Vibe would you go what what color would
(4:29:25) your Crystal be my favorite color is purple so you're going in a purple Crystal why not not a red Crystal well
(4:29:33) red is more conservative so yeah but your your hair is red you're not conservative you know my hair looks red
(4:29:39) it's really Brown I don't know why the lighting makes it look like that speaking you might crazy it looks red
(4:29:44) right 100 this whole time I thought it was a it was orange hair this whole time Brown now it looks more Brown now right
(4:29:51) I still feel like you deserve a red Crystal oh it looks white now all that light on it I'm sure I'm going to regret
(4:29:58) saying that but sure I don't care I was G to say I I've just got like a few Grays coming in on the sides you know I
(4:30:05) mean like is there actually an explanation for this Andrew or let's see what we of course of course there is man
(4:30:11) we're just a little a little bit of jousting that's but what is but like what is
(4:30:16) it okay I'll I'll explain I'll explain it do you know how you drive a blonde
(4:30:22) crazy I'll tell you later oh no okay K C says it is objectively true
(4:30:31) that there is no truth William um I'm not sure if we want to
(4:30:36) engage with that one too much CU is there objectively no truth that so the way I try to keep it to like 10 seconds
(4:30:43) and we'll move on because we'll just try to na yeah we'll just try to knock these out because is getting hungry I tell you
(4:30:50) objective truth exists but it is impossible to know something with absolute
(4:30:56) certainty all right 42 attack says will bad news is wait wait hang on what do
(4:31:03) you know with wait do you know with absolute certainty wait do you know with absolute certainty objective truth
(4:31:10) exists no then why would you say there's objective truth dumb ass because because I believe it what the [ __ ] what what the
(4:31:18) [ __ ] so so so you know what a belief is right you can believe something without
(4:31:23) having absolute certainty that that thing is true right absolute truth does absolute truth exist in my belief system
(4:31:31) yeah okay all right wait it exists inside your belief system does it objectively exist yeah oh okay question
(4:31:40) and can you know anything for sure no oh well then how can absolute how can
(4:31:45) absolute truth because that's how objectivity works just because you don't know already did this dance
(4:31:51) earlier you guys already did this dance earlier okay so we're gonna move on uh trainer uh so uh yeah so bad news you
(4:31:59) lost 100 the good news is you got free education you should thank an Andrew that's from 42 attack so bad news is you
(4:32:07) lost $100 trainer TIG says if all humans are mortal why do we strive for
(4:32:12) immortality the premise is humans are mortal which is then used to question
(4:32:18) the pursuit of immortality what the hell was that question if all is that for me
(4:32:25) it's a whole lot of question did you want me to repeat it or all humans are mortal why do they want to pursue
(4:32:30) immortality because they won't be human anymore is that is that the if all humans mortal why do we strive for
(4:32:37) immortality because it sounds better more fun for the person is that that's what I'll say sounds like
(4:32:45) a more pleasurable experience that is desired by a human all right uh let's keep rolling uh
(4:32:52) Emily a says cause an assumption sorry cause an assumption can be a premise
(4:32:59) doesn't make any [ __ ] assumption a premise gaslighting is manipulation not
(4:33:05) all manipulation is gaslighting [ __ ] s they put ffs but you know
(4:33:12) parental filters a little bit there so any thoughts
(4:33:18) there no all right sorry Emily uh $5 Canadian uh not too much thought there
(4:33:24) cause an assum assumption can be a premise doesn't make any Assumption of
(4:33:30) premise um yeah I don't think the panel's got too much to say there the smartest man in the world says to the
(4:33:37) estrogen poisoned Ginger live streaming from the set of The Golden Girls
(4:33:43) everyone thinks I'm red hair invest in addiction Dairy be honorable and pay the
(4:33:52) BET bo uh the smartest man in the world follows up with modern day debate did
(4:33:59) fight the Flat Earth uh who is going to be uh having a debate with Andrew so
(4:34:04) that is Craig mcneel versus Andrew Wilson that's going to be on February
(4:34:09) 15th the first day of debate con by the way he's going to lose I just want to point that out very quickly might win no
(4:34:16) he's not going to win he might be better than you he's not better than me you don't know that did everybody did everybody see the uh did everybody see
(4:34:23) the debate the other night objectively I was just say I don't know if everybody saw the debate the other night where I
(4:34:28) called him a crotch feasant but uh yeah we had wait wait you called a man a crotch did well wait did you start with
(4:34:34) mini you got to call him a Mini Mouse crotch peasant otherwise it doesn't even count [ __ ] what the [ __ ] oh has to be
(4:34:42) Minnie Mouse crotch pheasant that's where crotch feasant comes from Family Guy Family Guy States it must be Minnie
(4:34:48) Mouse crotch pheasant otherwise there is no crotch peasant these otherwise yeah
(4:34:53) you're right it is um I I haven't act I haven't actualized the concept um I
(4:34:59) didn't Bean it though I didn't I didn't actually want to insult anybody uh I've called people worse honestly uh lost
(4:35:07) bronin 25 says premise one will cannot admit he is wrong too women cannot admit
(4:35:13) when they are wrong how is will not a woman um P.S I I get along pretty all
(4:35:19) these guys don't hang on hang on that sounds like a not only do I grant that the validity of this is correct but it
(4:35:25) must be also a sound argument as will has quite often sounded like a woman
(4:35:31) this evening I must admit and and only because of this will it's not because I dislike you I do like you because it's
(4:35:38) only because you do seem to have problem s admitting when you're wrong about
(4:35:43) something and you know you you would actually be 10 times a debater if you would make concessions about things
(4:35:50) which are completely irrelevant ultimately to what it is you're trying to get at it would make you 10 times
(4:35:56) better I'm just pointing that out all right let's move on next
(4:36:02) question CDI says should two men be allowed to breastfeed their children come on will I know what kind
(4:36:09) of question will should they will just go ahead and say yes I think I already answered this question if your
(4:36:15) intent is to Fe them well yeah it's the same idea
(4:36:20) uh if your intent is to feed them that is not going to succeed in feeding them
(4:36:26) so what if your intent is what if your intent is to just bond with them by sticking your nipple in their mouth will
(4:36:33) if your intent is to bond with them yeah like it is a significant bonding uh and I can stud after study no
(4:36:41) it's this a good question we're asking what is a healthy way to bond with a child what is a healthy way child is it
(4:36:47) a man sticking their nipple in a child's mouth is that good for bonding will
(4:36:52) right I would say no all these men who claim they're women
(4:37:00) sticking their nipple in a child's mouth not a great idea right I'm not sure if is that because
(4:37:06) they're not women will like do you have a problem with a mother sticking her nipple in a child 's mouth well this
(4:37:13) hurts like what if it wasn't to feed the child swear right that was like it it
(4:37:18) didn't give him enough nourishment she had to use like a bottle and other things to help with the nourishment because she wasn't pumping enough but it
(4:37:24) did help with bonding is that a problem then I don't think it would be appropriate you don't think that a
(4:37:30) mother having a child latch on to her breast even though clearly that assists
(4:37:36) with bonding even if she had to use supplemental formula because she couldn't pump enough is wrong
(4:37:42) I don't think that helps the baby very much you don't think that that assists with
(4:37:47) bonding does it assist with bonding is is it a healthy way to bond I don't know I don't think why is it
(4:37:53) unhealthy because it's not nourishing the child oh it is it's just not a ton of nourishment they get some yeah sure
(4:38:01) they get some oh then sure do it so then for you men putting their nipple in
(4:38:07) mouth even if it's not much nourishment but just a tiny tiny bit that's still
(4:38:13) okay for the if it's nourishing a child then I'm all for it now what if I were
(4:38:19) to say all cringed up guys come on actually actually I do too I just
(4:38:24) have one at the poor fell what if I could show you studies that said that even if
(4:38:30) you were to bottle feed because you the mother could not produce enough milk for your child that even sticking your bare
(4:38:36) nipple in the child's mouth as the mother assisted with bonding you would still have to concede that for a male
(4:38:43) that should be the case too right but you're saying in this study that there's still nourishment being given to the
(4:38:49) child no there's none at this point then from from my intuition that sounds
(4:38:54) inappropriate okay yeah but from a scientific standpoint if if science helps us discover truths that are not
(4:39:01) intuitive so if science says that women who let their baby latch onto their
(4:39:06) breast even if they can't give them nourishment and have to supplement it will why shouldn't a male be able to do
(4:39:13) that will why shouldn't you go over and stick your [ __ ] tit in your child's face and let him suck it will does
(4:39:20) benefit does it benefit the child Andrew it well why would it benefit the child if it's the mother in this acent does it
(4:39:26) benefit the child for the mother it seems to from the mother yeah does it benefit so would it benefit the mother for with the child for the should i m
(4:39:32) them I don't think it would will I'm will but will I'm willing to be
(4:39:38) corrected if it is the case that a mother her nipple in the child's mouth and it does benefit the child wouldn't
(4:39:45) it then logically also be that if Will you wi and put your nipple in your kid's
(4:39:51) mouth as an infant with that's just not no stop will
(4:39:57) can you answer my question will um I guess there is so so so if I could
(4:40:04) scientifically show you that benefits the child that a woman putting their nipple in a child's mouth benefits her
(4:40:10) you would if you were single dad put your nipple in your kid's mouth I don't think I would do it why not that would
(4:40:17) probably make me all right all right all right you guys are both on mute you're killing me I'm going to cringe to death
(4:40:23) speak E's doing look look at that face speak e is doing everything he can to contain himself as well he's just like
(4:40:29) this is boys oh boy it was a good argument I I was enjoy I'll tell you you man like
(4:40:38) yeah know I'm I'm getting I'm getting W it shows inconsistency in the logic that
(4:40:44) the this uh genders everywhere has oh man they're just like oh like oh
(4:40:52) anyway like but I think these extremes need to be these extremes need to be
(4:40:57) presented because then it again it shows the inconsistency not extreme there are literally males right now we get
(4:41:05) to right now like nominal Naomi what was incist about what I said in a child's
(4:41:10) mouth in order to assist with pair bonding that is not in not only is this something which is happening I can give
(4:41:17) you the specific person's happening with the name transgender nominal Naomi
(4:41:23) sticks his nipple inside of a child's mouth in order to assist with pair
(4:41:29) bonding will is that a problem do this will is that is that is that problematic will it what what matters most is if
(4:41:36) it's benefiting the child yeah yeah will is that all right you don't not you're
(4:41:41) not going to all I know Andrew all I know is that you've got kids you know that when you've held them and they're
(4:41:47) teething and they latch on to something like your your hand like that it hurts
(4:41:53) it hurts it's like ow oh no Soo stop that kids are nasty um I couldn't
(4:42:01) imagine being a woman give scientific evidence that putting a nipple in a kid's mouth was beneficial to the kid
(4:42:09) would you the side of your hand no would you put your would you put your nipple in a little kid's mouth bro so Andrew
(4:42:16) why would you not Andrew Andrew please please entertain my question please
(4:42:23) sure scientifically proven to help the help the child do that if a mother does
(4:42:30) it good on them because obviously what if it's man I can't imagine well yeah
(4:42:36) that's that's the question right it's like if you really believe that men can be mothers then Naomi sticking his
(4:42:42) nipple for an adopted kid on his [ __ ] chest should be fine bro hey Andrew what
(4:42:48) if it's scientifically proven that it does help the child I can't wait for you to show me the scientific I'm not saying it is I'm saying what if it was yeah but
(4:42:55) I would I would I would likely have dispute with the scientific methodology that's true because you have a
(4:43:01) preconceived notion and you won't admit you won't listen to any object any opinions and scientific evidence that
(4:43:08) disagree with your prec are you saying I haven't listened to any of your scientific methods this even but you're
(4:43:13) admitting right now that you wouldn't listen to a scientific study that would disagree with your idea oh no no no I would listen to it you take issue with
(4:43:20) my my body hurts listening to you guys talk about let's hang hang well let's
(4:43:26) just let's again let's just granted okay 20 seconds let's say let's assume for a second the scientific study said that it
(4:43:32) was beneficial to an infant to latch himself if there was no mother present to a man's nipple I would still say
(4:43:38) there's moral problems with that will oh there it is hang on will there it is
(4:43:43) Will is there any problem with that if science says it's okay well it's be it's
(4:43:49) the fact well answer my question I just answered yours directly yeah would you say it's okay then for a man to stick
(4:43:55) his nipple in a kid's mouth if it's scientifically proven to benefit the child why wouldn't I will let me tell
(4:44:00) you about a little country off the coast called Papa New Guinea in Papa New
(4:44:07) Guinea men stick their dicks in little kids M hang on in little kids mouths at
(4:44:15) the demand of the little kids will and the reason that they do it hang on the reason that they do it is a right of
(4:44:21) manhood they demand to be able to do it will what are they doing that's
(4:44:26) wrong I'm not going to entertain this question I was just saying I'm yeah like
(4:44:32) I'm all for crazy con this is Li will I'll tell you what I'll tell you what
(4:44:37) hang on one second just look up come Warriors po a New Guinea if you think I'm lying all right I I never said you
(4:44:44) lying everybody heard hold on hold on hold on no no no no no no we got to stop you know what
(4:44:52) let that go way crazier than uh I usually would but you guys are both on mute speakes is the only one that's
(4:44:59) really behaving you guys just won't stop bouncing and uh I I swear like oh I just
(4:45:04) I hurt all over just like thinking about the things you guys are saying like I say those is those those kids to be fair
(4:45:12) I would have bringed them up too oh anyway the smartest man in the world did
(4:45:17) finish off the question by saying did ftfe ever figure out what an idiot he was or is it Professor Dunning Krueger
(4:45:24) still strutting from our last chat uh so that was the rest of their Super Chat and I'm going to move on and uh we'll
(4:45:32) ask the next question uh so here I'll uh yeah you can come off mute There Will and we'll ask the next question
(4:45:39) uh Google gole persistent malarian duct syndrome so yes so what is that
(4:45:48) persistent malarian do
(4:45:54) syndrome looks like all of our speakers are having a good wait I'm sorry what was the question I was I was enviously
(4:46:00) looking at my own shot thinking about when the opportune time would be to take it with my Crucible audience so I
(4:46:07) completely missed the question that's on me to be fair what was the question well I have the definition because the
(4:46:13) whole thing was just to look up definition so I can read it for you now of the Warriors or POA Guinea so the
(4:46:19) persistent malarian duct syndrome is a rare genetic disorder where a male with a typical 46xy kot type develops female
(4:46:27) reproductive organs like a uterus andian tubes alongside normal male genitalia
(4:46:32) due to an defect and anti- malarian hormones which usually causes the malarian ducts to regress during fetal
(4:46:39) development will will can you tell me what the question was because I'm not even actually sure the question was look up
(4:46:46) that term why that was the whole qu I think that was the whole question they didn't ask anything else about it Speak
(4:46:53) Easy what am I missing here I think the idea is they wanted to talk about it you're muted
(4:47:01) bro oh I'm muted on here oh I I just it was just a question asking to look up
(4:47:06) the definition of something and I I missed what the word was or the uh
(4:47:12) condition
(4:47:19) okay all right where we at I said I said a bunch of racial slurs while you were gone Ryan oh give me one moment I have
(4:47:26) to relocate my computer real quick okay you would do that you would do that all right no I I I I told you I
(4:47:33) was going to grab uh I was going to grab my own shot actually it was Speak Easy I tried to stop him Ryan I tried ah man
(4:47:41) you know you just had to say all that yeah all those hate speeches you know we
(4:47:47) just we can't handle it gonna have to ban you from YouTube gonna have to message the overlords that
(4:47:55) be I don't know isn't isn't the plat isn't the platformer of the evil worse than the

(4:48:06) here just any day now anyway here I'm going to so you're you're having a shot

(4:48:17) time at the request of yours truly uh at the debate con and I'm gonna I'm gonna
(4:48:23) have a little rip do you know Ryan I have video footage of me drinking Gavin mcginness under the table you think you

(4:49:04) that actually I'm just I can't help myself
(4:49:09) like I was just I have to say I was a little disappointed and I am excited for the fact that uh I think both you and
(4:49:15) Craig uh have thick skins and you will actually get through uh this debate topic which they're going to be debating

(4:52:36) guitar then uh yeah there's no reason we can't uh Make some noise that's uh it's kind of what I do listen
(4:52:42) I didn't even want to fly out this I know this piece of [ __ ] scumbag lunatic named Chase hagger happens to be one of
(4:52:50) my best friends in the world even though I [ __ ] hate him uh but he's a guitar genius I didn't even want him to come
(4:52:56) out to debate conon to make me look stupid because he's brilliant until I knew that you play the guitar and I
(4:53:03) needed you to be humbled for no good reason other than The Crucible audience will enjoy it so now he's flying out if
(4:53:09) you're bringing your guitar and that's the way it's got to be oh if I'm bringing my know I won't be bringing my guitar but I will I'll bring I'll bring
(4:53:15) my pipes not yeah what the [ __ ] thought that was the whole point yeah what the
(4:53:21) [ __ ] I was just say no no no I'll bring my pipes and uh kind of masculine setting is this we're supposed to be
(4:53:27) competing and talking [ __ ] Zeppelin yeah and and eating meat and drinking boo
(4:53:33) like what the [ __ ] this is a men's Gathering all right well I'll see what
(4:53:39) I'll see what I can do but I'm pretty sure that I can get my hands on a guitar like most most bars or your friend is
(4:53:45) going to bring a guitar so uh but my hope is is that they know how to play some of the tunes so that they can just
(4:53:50) play and I can just uh belt out some songs uh that's usually how I roll my life uh I try to find somebody who can
(4:53:57) play the tunes but I mean you know I can play uh my Mr Crowes and my solos
(4:54:03) eruption all that good stuff I'm an 80s rock guy so can't blame me uh for going
(4:54:08) down the rabbit hole there but we'll have fun we'll have fun for sure uh let's see the smartest man in the world
(4:54:14) says sex is a spectrum perfect example of a wrong opinion false non- dichotomy is are false what is it about L lism you
(4:54:24) find so valuable will lism like I can't I I'm not sure anybody
(4:54:29) know what lism is I don't know um well I let me just do a quick little Google
(4:54:36) here so I'll copy and past the wordell yeah that's weird one
(4:54:42) guys I don't know if it's just me but uh you seem a little quiet there right me
(4:54:48) oh me no right you yeah I can I can I'm having a hard time hearing you that last question there so I don't know if it was
(4:54:54) just me but my I turned I turned my preamp down earlier and I stepped away from the old uh the old 70-year-old Mike
(4:55:01) here it needs it needs a lot of preamp and help you know uh so lysenkoism is uh
(4:55:08) political campaign led by the Soviet biologist tram alenko against gen
(4:55:14) genetics and science-based agriculture in the mid 20th century uh rejecting
(4:55:20) natural selection in favor of lamaris
(4:55:25) um and then the second School of Harvard says a deadly mix of pseudo science and
(4:55:32) let's just open it up political ideology so yeah it seems like it's a 1900 Soviet
(4:55:42) scientist that uh engaged weird I like communism kind of don't know I'm doing
(4:55:49) what I can guys to help you out here and expand on this but maybe lysen cism is the best system anyone's everever
(4:55:55) thought of in their life so who you know who am I to deny yeah it this is a very long this is
(4:56:03) a very long article here uh that you can go through on Wikipedia we're not going to go through it right now but it does
(4:56:09) sound interesting uh from what I'm looking at uh maybe will will have some time to visit uh
(4:56:15) your thoughts there but let's carry on we got just a few more Super chats guys and then let's get out of here oh my two
(4:56:21) hours my butt I swear Jason Cassell in Ireland a woman has been arrested three times for wrong
(4:56:30) pronouns any thoughts there do you guys know about this yeah actually will had
(4:56:36) said something about that that was unrealistic but there's a dude in Canada that the the mother wanted to uh affirm
(4:56:45) a transition on the child the father didn't wanted and this father faced penalties for not wanting to affirm the
(4:56:52) kids's gender so like yeah that that [ __ ] does happen and that's a problem
(4:56:57) well that's a really different situation than not affirming a pronoun um but uh I don't know I struggle to
(4:57:06) believe that someone was arrested for not affirming someone's pronoun and to be honest though even even if you were
(4:57:12) in that situation that where there was some horrible totalitarian government and you say you have to always use a
(4:57:18) pronoun anyone over uses always you could always just reduce down using oh
(4:57:24) sorry sorry to cut you off I I do want to context here I looked this up right quick and uh it does it does appear that
(4:57:30) this is a a true story out of Ireland so a teacher in Ireland was suspended from work and jailed for contempt of court
(4:57:38) after refusing to use the correct pronouns to address the transgender student so I don't think that it was
(4:57:44) necessarily saying that she was jailed because she used the wrong pronouns but
(4:57:49) she was getting taken to court and then was in contempt to court but I mean the underlying girth there is uh that that
(4:57:55) was the situation so I mean to I mean I really appreciate you looking up that context because doesn't that just give
(4:58:01) Enlightenment to the situation she wasn't put in jail for using the wrong pronouns she was put in jail for being
(4:58:07) in contemp of Court after using the wrong wrong pronouns for a different charge that's a different situation and
(4:58:14) if you want to if if a if somebody is going to use pronouns to
(4:58:20) purposefully try to harass somebody and Bully them I think that is grounds for some form of um legal action and if if
(4:58:30) you if you really just it's a fundamental personal belief that it's it's contradicting your morals and that
(4:58:35) is the problem and you really just don't want to do it and the totalitarian government says you have to you can always reduce it down to using their
(4:58:41) name you can always use their name and then you don't have to lie to yourself
(4:58:47) or contradictor morals or any of that just use their name and that's it won't contradict anything you
(4:58:54) believe all right uh let's move on there guys if we can the smartest man in the
(4:59:00) world says an idiot admires complexity a genius admires Simplicity for an idiot
(4:59:05) the more complicated it is the more he will admire it Terry Davis look up the whole quote will he's talking about
(4:59:16) you it's a very I hate to it's hard to describe
(4:59:22) that without sounding insulting but it's almost like you don't think things can be complicated and be real like things
(4:59:31) are sometimes more complicated than you thought just cuz you thought it was one way and it was simple and it turned out
(4:59:37) to be something different and it's more complicated doesn't mean that was wrong quantum physics much more complicated
(4:59:44) than we thought it was and yet it is reality so it's weird to insult me just
(4:59:50) because my system is more complicated let's try to keep tring uh this is another one for you will and
(4:59:57) then uh maybe if you guys want to jump in there Speak Easy and Andrew uh give some thoughts back uh or we can keep
(5:00:03) trucking we've only got a few more Super chats to go a few did pop in since the last one so question for will is it
(5:00:10) objectively true that you can't know anything for
(5:00:15) sure is it objectively true can't know anything for sure I would say
(5:00:23) yeah yeah it's objectively from that one CI says I'm
(5:00:28) sorry I need clarification should trans women breastfeed their children this got
(5:00:33) lost in the debate oh no please no can we not please this turned into Papa New
(5:00:39) Guinea disturbing conversation so I've already answered the question the answer
(5:00:44) is if your goal is to nourish your child then that's not going to do it all right Brian Jonesy uh a lot of questions for
(5:00:53) you here will let's ask one for Andrew uh I like these questions no worries uh
(5:00:59) ALC says Chase Haggard is that Merl Haggard's son or something okay so I I
(5:01:05) just want to officially go on record it is true that chase Haggard has happens to be one of my best friends in the
(5:01:11) world but he's also a piece of [ __ ] scumbag because he's better than me in almost every metric which includes
(5:01:17) debate and music and logic and everything else and because I look up to
(5:01:22) him so much that is what makes him a piece of [ __ ] and so I still hate him and so even though he's my best friend
(5:01:28) and I hate him at the same time tell me what the contradiction is will you got nothing you got [ __ ] nothing will
(5:01:35) nothing it's not a contradiction I can hate him and he can be one of my best friends next question human emotions are
(5:01:41) so complex so so not Merl Haggard's son well I mean I would never try to
(5:01:49) determine where Chase's genealogy is the problem with Chase is that because he was born as an exact replica of Zar
(5:01:56) Nicholas and he has even the mustache cross with the goatee he could very well be Merl Haggard's long-lost son I have
(5:02:04) no clue I would never he's going to show up and start strumming the guitar and go Lord I was Bor a rambling man I'm going
(5:02:11) to be like that well he he could do that son he could do it because that's how talented he is but um that just kind of
(5:02:18) proves how bad all of us are in comparison so no I'm kidding but he's also a piece of [ __ ] because of that
(5:02:24) that's that's my that's my actual view I was going to say there's there there's so many uh versions of there's Ramble On
(5:02:31) Rambling Man and then there's um uh oh [ __ ] what is moral hagard song now I
(5:02:36) just had it in my head and then I wanted to make a par okay Ryan let me let me just let me just make this clear he's
(5:02:41) better than you Ryan he's better in every by like every conceivable metric
(5:02:46) he deserves more than us yeah he's just better okay he also he also is the true Dark
(5:02:54) Lord he's been running the Orthodox Discord for years he secretly puppeteers
(5:03:00) The Crucible the guy is [ __ ] he's like I mean you don't even want to know
(5:03:05) you don't even want to know let's put it that way you don't even want to know for your own safety I shouldn't even tell you but easy doesn't Chase Haggard run your
(5:03:13) channel too yeah this is objective facts
(5:03:18) by the I was gonna say oh sorry I was gonna say n just happened so I mean yeah
(5:03:24) if we can go down to the guitar no he won n too have have a have a [ __ ]
(5:03:29) guitar duel oh yeah be so much fun uh I'd love to get my I'd love to get my R
(5:03:35) spanked in America and a guitar duel you're you're right just to just to meet some good good freaking
(5:03:42) musicians uh you know it's it's it's few and far between every once in a while for me so I I would love but when you
(5:03:49) understand that chase really runs modern day debate and Will's channel that is when we'll be on the same
(5:03:55) level the top Shadow the shadow government of modern day debate all
(5:04:01) right he's everywhere all the time the secret guitar player all right there we go doing those uh the six the six string
(5:04:09) shreds there you go it he lives between us and in us there you go all right ALC says

(5:04:30) space Venus isn't the Mars the one for boys I
(5:04:35) mean I would I'd go to Venus why not

(5:08:02) alpha is the Al he is a gentile all right so uh
(5:08:09) called Alpha logic mark serson said Ryan Ryan was
(5:08:15) bringing his guitar until he found out Andrew was bringing a shredder that's kind of funny because that's my main job
(5:08:20) I brought out the classical but like my main job is just to be the shred guy like all I play with is the Kramers on
(5:08:28) my wall here so I mean I don't know but I I love good I I love good uh acoustic
(5:08:35) players for sure especially in uh in bar situations cuz you know you can cover a
(5:08:40) lot of ground and it can get really intimate so why not but uh yeah Andrew uh yeah just just just
(5:08:49) hit your buddy up there and tell him to bring two guitars ain't no reason we can't shred together why why aren't you
(5:08:55) bringing your guitar bro what's stopping you from bringing your guitar or one of your many you just
(5:09:01) told us you got why why a lot of guitars to not bring to the event you you you
(5:09:08) literally on on even a regular flight can check two bags you check the one bag
(5:09:15) and then you check the guitar you have the whole bag extra in addition to the guitar what the [ __ ]
(5:09:22) what's the excuse yeah all think boys all right I'll think on it okay they're

(5:11:28) look red now that's fair it doesn't well the the beard kind of does Am I Wrong PE easy the beard still
(5:11:35) looks red some weird color going actually the hair did still for me too so I I might be seeing something
(5:11:41) different yeah who knows I'm half mystery meat so
(5:11:47) who knows what I really am i w all right let's go into those closings and uh oh as I say that I last
(5:11:55) Super Chat says Andrew will pay for your seat on the plane for your guitar that's
(5:12:02) from Mark by the way hang on did I tell you that I told James I only fly first
(5:12:07) class Jesus are you gonna demand a first class ticket for my guitar no no just a first
(5:12:16) class ticket like that's I mean that's that's you know oh me no I'm not I'm not
(5:12:21) so picky I've never been so I've never been so bro dude have you ever have you ever been in Bur CL do you know how good
(5:12:27) it is they give you the meal and you eat the whole way down now it's it's [ __ ] food the point isn't to eat it the point
(5:12:35) is to pick it up and scoff at everybody who's not in first class and just kind
(5:12:41) of Lord it over them even though you know it's garbage food that's it's about asserting your dominance see I just
(5:12:47) bring I just bring a lot of cash and I just keep grabbing ipas so by so you're
(5:12:53) going to be you're going to be paying for the first round of drinks for the entire Crucible crew you eat my whole H
(5:13:01) anyway I won't say any more that language I've been saying I've said enough on you yeah exactly MCH MCH time
(5:13:09) in his head he's like actually all right all right closing stat closing St yeah yeah yeah hell to the NW there Andrew
(5:13:14) yeah if anything yeah you can you can it's completely Fair because the opposition opened first uh that me and
(5:13:22) speaky uh give our closings and then he gets the last word that seems fair yeah
(5:13:27) that's always the way I do it I do it the UK style I I I love those old debates uh you know you go back and
(5:13:34) watch the William Lane Craig Christopher Hitchens and uh yeah UK always does it whoever starts ends so uh now because
(5:13:42) Speak Easy went first I should really go first with my closing but I'm gonna put
(5:13:48) it back on Speak Easy anyway because I'm an [ __ ] oh you that's fair that's fair yeah you rosy red one all right on
(5:13:56) definitely a fair deal yeah
(5:14:01) sure well first I I want to say again thank you uh to modern day debates for
(5:14:06) giving me the opportunity to come up uh thank you to Will and pep talks as well for actually showing up and doing the
(5:14:14) debate um a lot of people on your side don't even attempt to do the back and
(5:14:20) forth they like the echo chamber so I at least appreciate that and I don't take anything personal if anyone wants to
(5:14:26) find me it's Speak Easy with a zed on YouTube uh for my closing I just want to
(5:14:32) say I don't think the other side at all uh showed anything any actual uh logical sense to
(5:14:41) why we should even consider more than two genders and um there definitely
(5:14:46) isn't more than two genders that's uh basically it and also thank you to Andrew Wilson and The Crucible for the
(5:14:54) support I appreciate it big time all right over to you Andrew being a big
(5:15:02) turd handing it over to speak easy after describing the rules I know what a piece of [ __ ] know what a piece of [ __ ]
(5:15:09) a collective pile all right over to you Andrew for sure you got uh 60 seconds
(5:15:15) the final thoughts what the [ __ ] 60c what is this what okay yeah that's all
(5:15:20) uh so so very quickly um because I'm a [ __ ] knocker uh thank you to speak easy
(5:15:27) uh let's start with that uh you were a great wingman in this debate and man it
(5:15:32) is hard to find good people who will uh step up to the plate so
(5:15:39) um I'm going to take this entire time to affirm my opposition rather than myself
(5:15:46) uh thank you to will you were extremely good faith even when we got into like
(5:15:52) the um what do you call it like todry back and forth you were even good faith there and so respect where respect is
(5:16:00) due my arguments were better by your own concession but but you were still good faith the
(5:16:08) entire time as we made these arguments so for that I very much thank you and
(5:16:15) with that I will say you can catch me at modern day debate you will see me over
(5:16:22) there with this doofus next to me this [ __ ] guy is but anyway Chase Hager is
(5:16:28) going to blow him out if you want to see Chase hagger blow him out Chase Haggard hasn't even agreed to come but he will
(5:16:34) and we're going to blow this idiot out and then on top of that him under the table and then on top of that you're
(5:16:41) probably going to see Speak Easy there and then on top of that will will probably come too because The Crucible
(5:16:48) will take care of your ticket will go ask your wife for permission go be like honey we need permission I gotta I gotta
(5:16:56) go I you're saying this just so that when you debate Alex Stein the next day you can't cut me off in my [ __ ] dud
(5:17:03) what the [ __ ] who cut somebody off and they're closing the [ __ ] [ __ ] piece
(5:17:08) of [ __ ] like me not very it's not dude what the [ __ ] kind of [ __ ]
(5:17:14) is are you going to cut are you going to cut everybody off yeah they call me garbage Maple where I'm from uh anyways

(5:17:27) like he's so [ __ ] hung over I'll be there like oh my God why why did you do this Andrew why why drink this much Mr
(5:17:35) Stein and me have a very old relationship I've been going back and
(5:17:41) forth with Stein for years he's a good friend of mine now he's not like Chase
(5:17:46) Haggard where he's like a logical and musical genius but he is a buddy of mine and so
(5:17:54) is is Alex Stein gonna like go out with us and have drinks and have a good time

(5:23:37) buzzing around our heads a whole L but yeah throw the marketing a little bit it it it really sounds like it's going to
(5:23:42) wind up being like that movie Hangover but with people who are debating each other all the time so I think that
(5:23:48) sounds like a way more fun version of Hangover so this is fantastic this is
(5:23:53) awes that sounds like that sounds like my heaven um to be honest all right let him have this that
(5:23:59) sounds awesome so uh yeah um for my closing you're too fast I I I I tried to
(5:24:05) explain my my side pretty well I want to make the most important point of my debate is
(5:24:11) that we oversimplify gender and sex and things are sometimes more complex than
(5:24:17) you think um and someone's personal opinion about themsel you cannot change
(5:24:23) you cannot take them away from them and if we want to support each other be a supportive respectful Society then we
(5:24:29) should support people when they need help and if they want help um so I do
(5:24:34) appreciate uh Wilson and Speak Easy and Ryan for for being here um I think MDD
(5:24:41) the the live event is going to be a Vibe with Ryan rocking his uh guitar and
(5:24:46) everyone drunk all the time that sounds like the best time ever I don't want to bring guitars I
