(0:00) Can you guys hear me? Oh, yeah. We can hear you.
(0:06) Okay. So, um I guess everybody would mute their mics except Sauy.
(0:11) Nobody can talk in here unless they have the live stream VC role. So, that's why we use a Oh, yeah. Let's get a Wait, can anyone
(0:18) join this? Yeah, anyone from the server can join it. And anyone in unverified can join it as well.
(0:23) Oh, yes, sir. Hold on. Let me tell my Discord server to get their ass in here. Where's the link? Room's going to cap at
(0:30) like 50, dude. Or at 50. Mhm.
(0:41) It's going to be tough. Are you ready to have this debate or you going to try to drag your whole [ __ ]
(0:47) Discord in here? We can go at any time. It doesn't matter to me. All right. Go ahead, Andrew.
(0:53) Yeah, go ahead. All right. Great. Uh, Andrew, just name the trait.
(0:59) Name? Well, I'm sorry. You said that I was going to embarrass Orthodox people by having a debate on name the trait.
(1:06) Oh my gosh. Are you hang Are you going to tell me what the argument from the orthodox
(1:13) perspective is supposed to be on name the trait? Name the No. Since not orthodox. That's
(1:18) why you would embarrass yourself. Now, name the trait. I said I would assume his position. Were you not tracking? I was not. I guess I wasn't. Look, look,
(1:26) look, look. I'm not interested in any of this offuscating or proaricating or posturing. Name the trait.
(1:32) Uh name the trait for what? For the the vegan things. Yeah. Name the trait that if it were to be true of humans that is currently true
(1:39) of animals would make it morally permissible to factory farm and eat them for food. Name the trait. Yeah. Is that a knowledge claim that
(1:45) you're asking? Do you know? Oh my. You're so I can't
(1:50) say that. Yeah. It has nothing to do with epistemology. Name the trait. It it Well, it doesn't have anything to do
(1:56) with epistemology. Are you making a knowledge claim? No, you're not. You're not making the
(2:03) trade. Well, you're asking me a question. I'm asking you. So, I can be agnostic on vegan ethics
(2:08) and still ask you to name the trade. Name the trade. I see. So, so are you you're asking me a
(2:14) question, a knowledgebased question, right? Yeah, I'm asking you to name the trade. Okay. So, I real quick just so we can
(2:20) cover a few things. Uh let's first let's start with uh know the knowledge claims
(2:26) themselves. Is that okay? Can we do that? Take a look a couple
(2:32) this is this is this is what we Oh my goodness. Never say meta ethics again. You have no idea what that means.
(2:37) What we can do is have you name the trait. Yeah. But the thing is is I think we
(2:43) have to take a look at a few things to justify whether or not you can even ask me this question. Why are you dodging on earth? You're
(2:50) doing you're doing the J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J J D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D D thing, right? Like this stupid dumb [ __ ] EO J Dyer thing and you're dodging the question.
(2:57) So maybe if I autistically repeat it. Okay, if you want me if you want me to over Okay, here's my position then. If
(3:04) you're asking me this question, is the question that you're trying to ask me directly I was trying to throw you a bone here, but is the question you're
(3:10) asking me directly just this? Is there a trait which animals h have that human beings don't have that justifies you in
(3:17) eating them? Wow. Is that the question you're asking me? That's
(3:22) the question. Yeah, that's the question. The response to this question is I'm sure there is. However, there are so
(3:28) many traits which exist that I could not possibly name it unless you can name all
(3:34) of the traits that human beings have so that I can pick one. Can you?
(3:39) What in the flying [ __ ] Repeat what you just said. Please repeat it. I want everyone to hear what you just said. Do
(3:45) you agree with me that there's a somewhere around I don't know an infinite amount of
(3:50) repeat repeat exactly what you just said dumb [ __ ] that came out of your mouth there's nothing nothing dumb about what
(3:56) I just said is it the case look I grant that you don't think there's anything dumb about it but I know what you just said is
(4:01) okay well then what did I just say yeah what you just said is this I believe there is a trait right
(4:07) but I could never know what it is because there's so many and you would have to name every single one of the traits for me to know which one it is
(4:14) repeat that Agree with Well, do you agree with me that because you just asked me? If I call you stupid, why
(4:19) would I agree with you? Do you agree with me? I don't understand why you're freaking out. Do you agree with me that there's so many traits?
(4:25) Stupidity annoys me. That's why I'm freaking out. Do you Do you Do you Okay. Can you answer a question for me? Do you do you do you are you going to
(4:31) answer my question? I answered I didn't I'm sorry. Did I answer your question? I asked you to name the trait, right? I
(4:37) asked you to name the trait and I answered the question was you said this. You said there are so many traits. I
(4:42) can't actually name the trait until you tell me all the traits which means the answer to the question is no, right? What you said is contradictory
(4:49) and I also can't give you the trait. Dude, you're really People think that that proposition generates a conting
(4:56) name and also can't name the Yeah, I I told you stupidity freaks me out, right? People say stupid things.
(5:02) I I agree. So, can you name the trait? Yeah. So, I I think I could, but you'd have to give me a list of every trait
(5:09) that a human I didn't ask. See, so this is a little bit of a tracking error on your part. I didn't ask you if you think you can name
(5:14) the trait. I asked you if you can name the trait. I can name the trait. I can name the trait if you give me a list of all human
(5:19) beings. Do you want to retract that claim? No, I don't. No. Okay. So wait, you can name the trait if
(5:26) I give you. So it's conditional. You can name the trait if and only if I list out every single trait which exists. Yes.
(5:33) Oh, that's [ __ ] Why? Yeah, that's just a dodge. So can you
(5:38) can you answer my question? What's wrong with what's wrong with that? Can you tell me what's wrong with that? What's wrong with So when I say Wait, I
(5:45) can't say that it's it's YouTube. Yeah. So when I say it's Rworded, that means it's dumb. So the issue with
(5:55) Listen, that's not telling me what's wrong with it. Except I just wait. Do you want it? Yeah. Give it to me in a [ __ ]
(6:01) syllogis. If it's the case that what you say is [ __ ] then I shouldn't answer it. And then you
(6:07) can Yeah, you just But that's not telling me anything. It's not telling. Okay. Name the traits [ __ ] Name the
(6:13) trait. What you said is [ __ ] Name the traits [ __ ] Oh, there we go. That gave you a bunch of
(6:20) retardation. So, can you can you can you answer Can you answer what's the problem with that answer?
(6:26) Are you like, can you answer my What's the problem with that answer? What's the problem
(6:32) with the answer? Oh, the problem is it's [ __ ]
(6:37) What are you talking? What's the problem with the answer, dude? What's the problem? Yeah. So, like, look, look, maybe I could put it maybe I could put it in a
(6:43) way that you understand. If I ask you what day it is today and you say come
(6:48) [ __ ] me in the app. Mhm. Right. I'm going to say the answer that you gave to my question is [ __ ]
(6:53) No, but if you ask me what day is it today and I ask you to give me a list of Do you agree? Wait, I just want to be I
(6:59) want to be clear. If I ask you what day it is today and you respond, come [ __ ] the app. You agree that's a [ __ ]
(7:04) response, right? Oh, well is I would agree I would agree that that would be a nonsequittor or at
(7:10) least it wouldn't be what you're trying to do. Dude, you have to you have to stop
(7:17) spuring out and we can have a productive conversation. Look, look, look. I just want you How is it that How is it that you think
(7:23) you're making orthodoxy look good here? I never said I'm making orthodoxy look
(7:28) good. But I thought your entire object The entire objection to me was that I made My obsession to you is that you would
(7:34) lose to synth in a debate on NT because you're [ __ ] That's my entire Well, I got to tell you, if you ask me a question, you
(7:40) realize I got to tell you, you're looking really question it would make you look [ __ ]
(7:45) Is there I'm sorry. Is there a wrong answer to NT? Yeah. Any answer that leads to a
(7:50) reductio or a contradiction? Did I give you Did I give you an answer that led to a reductio? No, no, no. You didn't give me an
(7:56) answer. No, I gave you an answer. No, no, no. You didn't give me an answer. I gave you an answer. Yes, I did. No, no, no. You No, no, no. You didn't
(8:02) see what you did was you gave a conditional. You said I will give you an answer if you do X. Which means you didn't give me No, I didn't actually say that. What I
(8:08) said was I do you didn't say that. So you didn't say that. Sorry. No. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. So you
(8:15) didn't say you have to let Listen if I named every trait that was in existence. Don't let the If you don't let the other
(8:20) person speak, we can't even have a discussion. So you tell me when you're done. You let me know when you're done
(8:26) speaking and then I'll speak. Go ahead. Yeah. When I mute my mic, that means I'm done speaking.
(8:32) So anyway, whenever whenever whenever you let me know, just give me the high sign.
(8:37) Well, when I muted my mic, after I said when I mute my mic, I'm done speaking. A normal person would take that as a cue
(8:43) to talk. Yeah. So, I mean, are you are are you done? Do you want do you want to let me talk?
(8:48) Did you just say yes? When I mute my mic, can you can you not see that? Uh, well, no, I actually can't see that.
(8:57) Yeah, I'm going to mute it now. Okay, thanks. That's that's all I was asking for. So, actually, that's not what I said. I didn't actually say the
(9:05) only way that I could name a trade is through this. What I said was this specifically. You asked a question. Can
(9:11) you name a trade? Right? That's a and you asking a question. I answered your question. I do believe I could name a
(9:17) trade. I just think you would have to list every single trait a human being has uh for me to do. So, that's not not
(9:24) only is that not evading the question, but there's nothing there that leads to a reductio. And your only response is
(9:30) that's [ __ ] which is not that's not false. What are you saying there? Clear
(9:35) up some of the I never said that. You said you could only answer the question if I gave you
(9:40) every single trait. What I said is that you said you would answer the question if I named every single trait.
(9:46) That is what you said. And I said your response is [ __ ] Why? Because it's not an answer. Yeah, it is an answer.
(9:52) No, no, no. It's not an answer. In the same way you in the same way if I were to ask you what day is it today and you
(9:58) responded come yes the ass
(10:04) wouldn't be easy but then I would just respond by saying that's [ __ ] and then if you were to ask me well what's the problem with it I would respond again
(10:10) with that's [ __ ] Okay so let me respond to this. So, if it is the case that you that somebody
(10:17) asked you what day of the week it is and you said something about [ __ ] in the ass, that wouldn't be relaying to the
(10:22) actual question that they asked you. I am actually answering the question you asked me directly. I even I even asked
(10:28) you to make sure I had it clear. The only thing that I told you is that you're aware that the only Dude, let me
(10:34) let me talk for five seconds before you cut in. I've been just I've been super super good been super good faith with
(10:40) you. I don't know why you're sping out so badly. I just need you I need you to relax. Look, look.
(10:46) Walk me through it. I don't want to have to walk. I need you to walk me through it. If someone asks me Yeah, I will. I will.
(10:52) I'll do it real slow. I know you like it real slow. I got you. If someone asks me the question, yeah,
(10:57) what day is it today and then I say I mean, look, you're just going to have to tell me every single day
(11:04) of every single month before I can answer your question. So, if somebody said that they needed
(11:10) Stop. Go ahead. Stop. Mhm. That means they're providing a conditional, right? They're saying, "I
(11:15) will answer your question if and only if you meet condition X." Yeah.
(11:21) Stop. Stop. Yeah. That's not what they're saying. You [ __ ] stop. Stop. Stop. Look, dude. They didn't answer. They
(11:28) gave in which they would they gave conditions under which they would answer the question. And the principle I set forth
(11:35) with the other Yeah. And the principle I set forth with the analogy is that if instead of answering my question, you
(11:41) just say something stupid, I'm going to call it ret. Okay. And instead of answering my question,
(11:46) Yeah. you just said something stupid, so I called it [ __ ] Okay. Do you understand now?
(11:51) Yeah. So, can I respond now? Yeah, you have permission. Go. Yeah. So, if it was the case that
(11:57) somebody said to you, uh, hey, what day of the week is it? The other person said, you know, I can't answer that
(12:02) without more information. and then told you what the requisite information was that they would need so that they could give you a concise answer. That is
(12:09) actually answering your question. Can you refute that in any way or tell me how that's wrong? Yeah, I just I just I want
(12:17) this is so stupid. I But you you still haven't actually contended with what I'm saying.
(12:22) No, no, no. You're you're so stupid. Yeah. I mean, you just keep saying that, but I'm waiting waiting for you to
(12:27) actually give me something. Relax, relax, relax. I'm relaxed. Yes. So, in order for me to answer your
(12:33) question, you need to meet these conditions. And then you said, "That's an answer to your question." You understand how that
(12:39) Yeah. You understand how those two How long have you been How long have you been kids?
(12:44) How long have you been diddling kids? Answer the question. Answer the question. I just want to be clear.
(12:49) Uhhuh. You understand how affirming both those propositions is contradictory. Neither. Neither are propositions,
(12:56) you [ __ ] idiot. Neither are propositions. It's a one's an answer. I just want to be. I just want to be. Yeah, that's that's correct. Those
(13:02) aren't asking me a question is not a proposition. You stupid [ __ ] Monkey. Monkey. I'm sorry. Is a question a proposition?
(13:09) Yes. So, oh my goodness. Monkey. Banana. Answer my question. Is a question a
(13:16) proposition? You affirm the proposition. Is a question a proposition? I will stop. Stop.
(13:21) Answer my question. I will answer. Yeah. Hush monkey. Okay. I will answer your question. Okay. Okay. Dude. Dude. Mystery.
(13:29) Mystery. Mystery mystery mystery. Mute the mute the mute mystery or you won't mute the
(13:34) And then you also affirm the proposition won't let me talk. Well, that's true, right? Because either
(13:40) it's true. Do you think that's Yeah. So when you say affirming both of those proposition
(13:45) neither none of those are propositions. What are you talking about? You [ __ ] Let's start with this. This is really
(13:50) simple. I will let you I will let you talk, dude. You have to chill the [ __ ] out, but I'll let you talk. But you need
(13:57) to answer a question first. Is a question a proposition? I'm going to unmute you so you can talk. Is a
(14:04) question a proposition? Just start with yes or no. Then give your qualifier. No. No. A question is not a proposition.
(14:10) So then So then when you said Hang on, hang on. No, you stop. [ __ ] Let me finish. Let me finish. [ __ ]
(14:16) All right. So the question you can't help himself. Yeah, I know, dude. This guy can't have a conversation. So this is why nobody likes these [ __ ]
(14:23) If it's the If it's the case that a question is not a proposition, why'd you just say that the answer to that
(14:29) proposition that you you said it was a prop? It's not a proposition. Do you understand
(14:34) that? But anyway, you understand that I asked you. You're so stupid. I asked you a question and
(14:40) you provided a response which was propositional. You said I will do X if
(14:45) you meet X. That's not actually the case. What I said was I I That's not what Wait, that's not what you said. Hope it's not.
(14:50) So, you didn't say, wait, so you didn't say you would answer the question if I provided every trait that exists. You didn't say that. What I said was this. I believe there
(14:58) on that. What I said was, I believe there isn't. You want to bet? Yeah. I want you to shut up so I can You only need to say things one time.
(15:04) Yeah, dude. Just chill out, dude. Chill out. I'm just dealing Jerry Springer, dude.
(15:09) Just chill the [ __ ] out. I know it's not Jerry Springer. Anyway, calm down. Just stop acting like it, idiot. Calm down, dude.
(15:15) Just stop acting like an idiot. Look, look at you. You just can't control. Yeah. You're a [ __ ] child, dude. You're
(15:20) a petulant child. Exactly. So, this is why nobody takes you seriously. Yes. Exactly. Definitely.
(15:26) Yeah. I know. Glad you agree. Wait, I just want you to be very clear. The dumb who you think is like the
(15:33) orthodox god here couldn't open the jar after he made fun of a woman for doing Nobody thinks his dumb
(15:38) Yeah. I guess if she had opened the olive jar, he'd have a good point. Yeah. Yeah. She didn't open the other. That's right. She didn't [ __ ] open.
(15:45) That's right. That's right. Yeah, you could do what the woman could do. Now, if she could call
(15:52) and neither never never [ __ ] said it. You're just making [ __ ] up. But anyway, if you could
(15:58) if you could if you could just tell me is a question a proposition. You said
(16:04) no. Okay. Well, then I don't understand. What are what are you trying to dispute here? You didn't ask a question. Yeah. What are you trying What are you
(16:10) trying to dispute here? You didn't ask a question. That's what's in dispute. Like, no. You asked me a question and what I
(16:16) told you was I didn't say my question was can you just what part of my response was
(16:21) propositional? Yeah. When you said that I will answer your question. That's not what I said in case you meet. That is what you said.
(16:27) Nope. And I'll tell you I'll I'll tell you my position again. Look, do you want to bet on that? We can $1,000. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. Here's what I said.
(16:35) Yeah. Put it in an account and we'll bet. So here was here's my precise here's my precise position. I do believe
(16:41) that there is a trade, right? I just don't know what it is. But if you were to list off all human traits, I would be
(16:48) happy to name whatever that trait is if I knew if I knew what it was. That's it.
(16:53) All right. Great. So, you do think there is a trait, but you don't know what it is. Okay. Great. So, not off the top of my head, but I believe that there is a trait. Yeah.
(16:59) Yeah. That's that's great. Fantastic. You are aware that that's not naming the trait, right? That's the question. Can
(17:05) you name the trait? Which means your answer is no. You just think there is one. Like, look, I just want you I want
(17:10) you to be clear. I want to be clear here. Yeah, go ahead. You thinking there is a trait and not
(17:16) knowing what it is is not a response to NT because I'm asking you to name the trait.
(17:21) Yeah, I know. You just conceded that you Yeah, you just said we need a 5day detox to be clear. Jesus Christ. That's great. You just conceded that you
(17:28) can't that I can't what? You understand that, right? That like that's a concession. You just said I can't name the trait. I just think it
(17:34) exists. Yeah. But which means youed Hang on. I don't understand what's actually wrong with that. Wait.
(17:42) Yeah. Yeah. It's not a response. It is a response. What's the wrong with
(17:47) you? So So let me Yeah, there's nothing wrong with it. Okay. So So hang on. So So hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Can I just Can you
(17:54) calm down? Did you affirm NT? No, you wouldn't be affirming NT. I said there's nothing wrong with it.
(17:59) You still wouldn't. No, you wouldn't be affirming it either way. What's actually wrong? I didn't say you are. No, I didn't say
(18:05) you are. Yes, you did say that. There's nothing wrong with it. Let's start. There's nothing wrong with it if you go fermenting.
(18:10) Dude, if you if you want if you want to discuss it, we can discuss it. I'm going to ask you again. If a person tells you
(18:17) uh for instance, uh let's say a person comes to you and you ask them a question and they say, you know, I don't know off
(18:23) the top of my head, but I still believe that there is this thing, right? There is this thing. I still believe that this
(18:29) thing does exist. I just don't have the requisite information to name it because there's so many of them. I couldn't
(18:35) possibly know all of them off the top of my head. What's actually wrong with that? Yeah, I just said there's nothing wrong.
(18:42) Then what is your contention? Uh there's nothing wrong if Right. If
(18:47) Yeah. you affirm NT or you would need to Why would you need to affirm NT?
(18:53) Yeah. Or you're you don't. That's why I said or you're agnostic. Why would you need to be agnostic?
(18:58) What do you mean? Why would you need to be agnostic? Why is that a necessary conditional that you're agnostic? Okay. Let me add another one. Also, if
(19:04) you want to be rational. Okay. So, so wait a second. Uh how first of all, you'd have to demonstrate as
(19:11) rational. But before you even do that, why would the two conditionals be that
(19:16) you would have to affirm NT by answering that question that way? And how would it be the case that uh you would have to be
(19:23) agnostic? Can you explain that to me? Yeah. Because if you don't know what the trade is, but you just think it exists,
(19:29) that means you have no rational justification for holding the affirmation that it's perfectly moral morally permissible to factory farm
(19:35) animals and eat them for food. No, no, no. That wouldn't that wouldn't be an entailment. Wait, wait. So if you
(19:40) So if you believe not an answer, let him answer. Let him answer.
(19:47) That wouldn't be How would that be irrational if you believed that there was X thing? And so you said that you
(19:54) believed that there was rationalist have inferial justification. Wait, wait a second. Beliefs.
(20:01) Yeah, for your beliefs. Okay. No, no, you just Well, your justification is your belief, right?
(20:07) No, your justification is then give me then I'm sorry it isn't. Then give me a
(20:12) stance independent justification for any [ __ ] belief, you idiot. A stance independent justification for a
(20:19) belief. Yeah. reality. Like you're soing dumb. Can you answer my question? Give me a
(20:25) stance independent justification for reality. Yeah, reality. Reality is a stance independent justification.
(20:31) Yep. And are you the perceiver of reality? Yeah. Then how would that be? Then how would that be stance independent, you [ __ ]
(20:38) [ __ ] Are you Do you think that your perception Yeah. Do you think your perception of reality somehow changes
(20:44) reality? You [ __ ] I'm I'm sorry. Yes, I do. Yes. And so do
(20:49) you. Oh, then wait. So you think that if I look at a tree, right, let's just say there's a tree which exists. Okay. And I
(20:54) look at that tree and I see a dog. You think that mean that you think that means there's a dog there instead of a tree? Like that's what you think?
(21:00) Well, I think that if the case was that you were trying to justify there wasn't a dog there and you only had the
(21:05) perception of the tree that you would say that that was reality, right? No, no wait. How you come to know that
(21:11) something is justified is different than whether or not something exists. Okay, then I'm waiting for your stance
(21:16) independent justification. Yeah. Yeah. So stance independent justification is existence.
(21:23) Existence is your something stance how I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
(21:29) I'm sorry. I'm so I'm super confused. How does existence justify anything?
(21:35) Yeah, because you can use that which exists to justify your positions. Like No, no, you wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
(21:43) That which exists justifies a position.
(21:48) Is that right? Okay. I've never heard that before. Okay. So, use something which exists in reality to justify I
(21:56) don't know an ought. Go ahead. I know. It depends on what it is. Oh, no, no, no. You just said you could
(22:02) justify your positions with what exists in reality. [ __ ] So, tell me how I can get an a from something which exists in
(22:09) reality, dummy. Tell me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, that's true. Notice how I didn't say you can justify everything. No, you did say that. Okay. So what can
(22:16) you justify? So what can So what can you justify? You did say that but you did. No, bro. You did say
(22:24) that. But tell me what can you justify? What can you justify? What what can you
(22:30) what can you justify just by there being again? Guys guys,
(22:36) you don't need to repeat yourselves. Five, dude. Again, stick to answering the questions.
(22:42) Answer them once. Yeah. So anyway, I'm just just just curious what can you justify by it just
(22:48) existing? What is the justification there? What is the philosophical justification? Justify Yeah, I can justify my belief.
(22:53) And this is why I didn't say everything retine. I can justify my belief that a tree
(22:59) exists. What? Well, yeah. My belief that a tree exist is justified because the tree exists and I can use the tree
(23:05) that's in existence, right, to justify that belief. So it's so Wait, just to
(23:11) get this right. Uh, so if I say I exist, that's a justification. Like I think,
(23:17) therefore I am. Is that I got I got to stop you guys here, dude. If you can't stop saying re every 10
(23:23) seconds, we're going to have to end this. Whether Andrew likes it or not. No, it's not your [ __ ] You said you
(23:28) weren't going to do it at the beginning. [ __ ] Control yourself. You're an adult, right? You have a modicum of self control.
(23:35) Yelling right now. Just relax. I'm not yelling, dude. Like you [ __ ] said you would control yourself and you're promise that you are dudes. Just
(23:42) you're going to wake up your wife. Just calm down, buddy. No. No. Listen, he's right. You did promise. You're coming on a YouTube channel not to do that. So don't do it.
(23:49) Like show a modicum of [ __ ] self-control. Like impulse control. It's not Jerry Springer. It's not the [ __ ]
(23:54) streets. We're going to have a conversation. Act like a [ __ ] grownup or it's going to end.
(24:00) So if you're aheadent comments, I think that streets comment was racially motivated, but that's fine.
(24:05) Okay. So anyway, no idea what race you are. I'm [ __ ] I'm messing with you. If I look, man, if I went to your
(24:11) YouTube channel, obviously I wouldn't do things which would intentionally break the toss on your YouTube, you know. Yeah, that's that's my fault. I won't I
(24:17) won't keep Okay, so don't do that. Okay, that's that's ridiculous. But let's get back to this idea that you think that you can
(24:23) justify uh any any claim because a thing exists.
(24:29) Yeah. So, I I just want to be clear, what justifies a a belief and how you justify a belief are two different
(24:35) things. What can justify a belief which is what you asked is just that which exists. No, no, no. That's not what I asked.
(24:41) That's a truth for a proposition. Right. Now, how you justify it, that just depends on your theory of knowledge.
(24:48) Now, I don't actually. So, so then earlier when I was asking when I was asking about knowledge and you said this had nothing to do with
(24:54) knowledge. It does actually have something to do with knowledge then. No, it doesn't. The question you asked has nothing to do with knowledge.
(25:00) Literally. No. What you asked. Then how do you know then? How would you know that? I responded to it.
(25:06) How I would know. Yeah. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. I got to finish asking the question,
(25:11) man. Calm down. Calm down. Just take a breath. Take three deep breaths. Yeah. So, how could it be that that if
(25:18) you say that I'm answering a question incorrectly? How could it be incorrect if that's not a knowledge claim?
(25:24) I didn't say it was incorrect. Okay. So, it was correct. So, I correctly answered it.
(25:30) And I thought I thought So, then So, I don't You said it was an incorrect way. If it's not incorrect, then it's correct.
(25:35) But I thought we I thought we weren't doing the interruptions. Also, that's a false dichotomy. It could just be a non-answer.
(25:41) Okay. So, now to answer your question about knowledge, right? So, is it an is that a knowledge claim? I thought I thought we were not Look,
(25:47) well, I just want to make sure that all I'm asking is this. I'm just going to interrupt you, right? If you want to All I'm asking just let me let me
(25:54) actually answer the show a thing depends on your theory of knowledge and that has to do with
(26:00) truthmaker of a proposition. Yeah. The truth maker of a proposition. Yeah. Has nothing to do with epistemology.
(26:05) Is that an knowledge claim? Yeah, that's an claim. Okay, great. So then
(26:12) everything So do you think Wait, do you think Do you think that has anything to do with what I just said? Yeah. Well, yeah, it does. Yeah.
(26:17) No, no. I just want to be I just want to be clear. Yes, I do. Do you think No, stop. Stop. Do you think that a truth maker for a
(26:23) proposition being that which exists has anything to do with minds being being in existence right now? You think
(26:29) that can exist mind independently? I didn't say anything for a proposition. Do you think that can exist? I didn't say any of that. What I said is
(26:34) that that's a that's a question. I never claimed to say. Yeah, but you did just claim that I said that and I didn't.
(26:40) No, I didn't claim. Look, you keep on blundering things and that's why I keep on interrupting you. So, calm down. If you calm down, I'll tell
(26:46) you. Look, I'm very calm. I just have to be dominant and interrupt you because you like to say stupid things and you like to interrupt.
(26:52) Just chill out. Okay. What you're making here are knowledge claims.
(26:57) That's fantastic. Do you think that a truthmaker for a proposition can exist mind independently? Yes or no?
(27:03) Uh mind independently. A truth maker for a proposition. Truthmaker being who? The person who's making the proposition.
(27:10) No, truth makers don't have to be whoms. They can be anything, right? The truth maker for the proposition this tree is
(27:17) in this location. The truth maker for that proposition would be if that tree is in that location.
(27:23) Okay. Okay. So, the truth maker here, you're not saying it. The truth maker is the mind who's saying that.
(27:30) No, the truth maker is not the mind who's saying it. The truth maker is the tree being in existence. That's so So then you're saying that the tree
(27:36) would exist absent a mind. Yeah. And that's a knowledge claim.
(27:43) But no, it's stipulated. It's not a knowledge claim. It's not. No, it's something that's stipulated. So
(27:48) if I say a tree would exist a tree would exist absent minds. That's
(27:54) that's not a knowledge. That's okay. So if I say a tree would No, no, no. Just to be just to be clear, dude. I don't know why you won't let me
(28:00) [ __ ] speak at all. No. Yeah. Just to be Cuz I want to be clear. Yeah, because you were wrong, dude. Because you were wrong.
(28:05) Yeah. No, no. There was no There was no if I'm wrong. No, you were wrong. Objectively wrong. If you're asking me, do I know I'm
(28:11) stipulating the hypothetical in this way? Yeah, I know I'm doing that. Yeah, that's hypothetical. If you're
(28:16) asking me, does the hypothetical have anything to do with knowledge? No. That's a [ __ ] question. Sorry. Related question.
(28:22) Hypothetical has nothing to do with knowledge. No. The hypothetical has nothing to do
(28:28) with epistemology. I didn't know that. I didn't know that that hypotheticals had nothing. I grant you didn't know that. I grant
(28:33) you don't know. No, you're right. You're right. So, just just get it clear. I want to make sure that you understand what you just said. You just said that if you make a claim
(28:40) that a tree exists, absent minds, that's not a knowledge claim. No, that's not the claim that was being
(28:45) made. That's literally what you said. I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to replay it for you real quick. Uh mystery, real quick. Go back,
(28:52) clip out where he just said that so that I can play it for him. And make sure you clip out where Andrew
(28:58) just said what he thinks I said so we can compare the two. And then when they're not the same, I can laugh. No, he just denied that you said that.
(29:03) Right. Exactly. That's why I said when you take the clip of what you just said and then we play them together and they're not
(29:10) the same, I'm going to laugh. They are They are the same though. I asked you this question and you said you
(29:15) said no often confused right now. I'm not confused about anything. That's why you think they're the same. But I'll just show you. I'm just going
(29:21) to show you. Once you're confused, I'm going to laugh at you. I'm just going to show you the proof
(29:27) and then you can't say anything, right? No, once you show what you think is proof, I'm going to laugh at you.
(29:32) Oh, okay. Yeah. All right. I I don't I don't understand though why it is that you would say that
(29:39) and then say you didn't say that 5 seconds later. that I don't understand.
(29:45) Totally. Totally. Totally. But but anyway, yeah, they're rewinding it
(29:51) and they're going to clip that out for you. So, just hang tight for a second. That's great. Fantastic. And then we can watch you say that if
(29:57) you make the claim that was actually insane. I hadn't heard that before. I hope you know um because of the bets
(30:02) you agreed to during this stream, uh half the money is going to go to my my monastery, the Orthodox monastery I
(30:08) attend. So, you're going to be doing some charity. You don't attend an Orthodox monastery. I don't believe you. Oh, you don't believe me?
(30:14) No. That's great. Can I go there with you? I'm very happy. You can actually. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
(30:20) I looking for We could do like a little video. We could do a little IRL uh debate. Yeah. I just don't
(30:25) Cool. What's the thing that we're looking for? Yeah. So, uh the clip earlier I asked him if it is the case that you say a
(30:33) tree can exist absent any minds, uh is that a knowledge claim? He said no.
(30:43) So, we just want to grab that. About how long About How long ago was that? It wasn't very long ago. Maybe two, three minutes.
(30:51) All right. Give me a minute.
(31:16) That's the nice thing we can always do, right? It's what what comes with position is I can have people just go
(31:21) pull up what people said so they can't run away from it. But you have made some uh now maybe
(31:28) maybe you can say that I made some blunders in the convo. I would even concede that. But you made way more,
(31:33) dude. way more blenders in this one. And it's because I hope you know that. I don't know if there are like YouTube channels that go
(31:40) back and review debates. And if they would review this one Oh, yeah. There are tons. If they were to review this one and they were to count
(31:46) the blunders in the conversation. Mhm. Mine would probably be below three. And that's really generous. And yours is
(31:52) probably upwards of 25 by right now. Yeah. What's What's the blunders that I've made?
(31:58) You literally Yeah. You don't know a single one. The The truth is I know. I know. I know. Like the first
(32:04) blunder you made was saying you answered a question when you said you would answer questions. No, that's not
(32:09) it was an answer. Wasn't another made. We can make that 20. Wasn't that an answer?
(32:15) No, I said it was a non-answer. Oh, okay. What made it a non-answer?
(32:20) Yeah. Because it didn't answer the question. I thought I gave you an analogy to demonstrate this to you. Maybe I need to give it again. If I ask
(32:27) you what day it is and you say, "Can you [ __ ] me in the ass?" Mhm. That's the response. Do you think that Do you think that that's an answer? Do you think that's
(32:33) analogous? I do. So, you think that um if a person if you
(32:38) asked a person what day it was and they said, you know, I don't know off the top of my head, but I think with more
(32:44) information that I can figure out what day it was, that's not answering your question.
(32:49) No, that wouldn't be an answer. No, that's not answering a question. Okay. No. Oh, okay.
(32:55) That that wouldn't be. And just to be clear, that's not analogous to what you said, but No, it still wouldn't be an answer. No, I know. But you just said it's not
(33:01) answering a I mean it's clearly answering a question. It's not clear. Look, I I agree that you
(33:06) think it's clearly answering the question, but that's because you're stupid. No. Any rational person would say it's not
(33:11) an answer to the question. It's not. Do I need to repeat everything? Yeah. I mean, this is just mind-blowing
(33:17) to me. It sure sounds like an answer to the question. I grant your mind's blown. It is.
(33:27) Actually, it is. Yes. I think he's pulling it. Yeah. Sweet. Yeah. You know, give him a second.
(33:39) Oh, can the people who are in here type in chat without the uh perms or whatever it is?
(33:48) Uh, I don't know if they can type in chat or not. Yo, Moxy, can you try typing in chat
(33:57) if you can?
(34:07) Well, while we have this pause, I just want to shout out uh Shut up, dude. Shut up. Don't shout other people's channels out in here.
(34:13) No, I'm not going to shout out their channel. Don't shout out anybody. Don't shout out anybody. Oh, that's crazy.
(34:18) Don't do it. I wouldn't do it on your channel either, by the way. I would give you permission. Yeah. But
(34:25) do you realize do you understand why that's that's a good safeguard to have for channels? It's not to say that
(34:30) you're you're shouting somebody out who doesn't deserve it. It's just to say that obviously people can shout out
(34:36) certain things about people who can be problematic, right? Like let's say you
(34:41) went to a channel and you're like, I'm going to try to shout out and then you name some famous [ __ ] Nazi or something like that, right? That would
(34:46) obviously be really bad for someone. I wasn't going to shout out. I'm not saying you were, but that's why the policies I understand.
(34:53) Who cares? cuz you were being a dink anyway. You don't get the shut out [ __ ] on the channel. Shut up. Yeah, I wasn't I was agreeing with the Relax,
(34:59) Red. You're Are you sure you're going to tell anybody to relax, dude? You've been spuring the [ __ ] out this
(35:04) entire time. And you know what's really funny? I think you could have made me look worse on this if you hadn't sped out so bad.
(35:11) I mean, look, I look, I know you think it was a spur out. It was just It was a [ __ ] spur out. Look, I Well, look, I produce a lot of
(35:18) testosterone because I I often eat red meat and I'm I'm usually in the gym. I'm in great shape. I Why do you act like such a [ __ ]
(35:25) Um I don't know why the female decided to pipe up, but I know you can't relate. All right, buddy. That's why when I talk it's sort of
(35:31) dominant doineering, right? It just sounds like you're smurfing. The reason And the reason, right, why
(35:37) you felt sort of intimidated and felt like I was spuring is because I was just dominating you the entire conversation intellectually.
(35:43) Talking over people and being a pet child is not dominating acting like a [ __ ] child, dude.
(35:50) I could talk over you all day. It doesn't mean I'm winning anymore. Look, we know what this means. Like I could a loving father disciplines his
(35:56) children. That's sort of what I was doing to you. Yeah. Well, unfortunately, you didn't have one and that's why you act this way.
(36:01) Talk about berging out. You're yelling. Like, are you raised my voice slightly, dude? See, again, this is more
(36:09) female behavior. I ra I put a little bit of attitude in my voice. Oh my god. Stop yelling at me. Oh, Andrew. Your buddy is
(36:18) yelling at me. Oh, clutch your pearls harder, dude. We could watch a movie. Watch your [ __ ] pearls harder, buddy.
(36:24) Boy, is this the start or end of your cycle? I I just want to know.
(36:31) Oh, [ __ ] bird. You got me, bud. Your [ __ ] six friends are going to think you're so [ __ ] cool for this.
(36:37) Well, it's seven, but thank you. I appreciate that. Yeah, no problem.
(36:43) Anytime. You lowkey sounded like a radio host when you did that. Anytime. That [ __ ]
(36:49) was hard. You should You should do that. You got a voice for it. Yeah, your mother agrees.
(36:55) She likes when I whisper in her ear. Anyway, the interesting thing that you'll find about me too, man, is that
(37:01) um even on an isolated topic like this, like let's say veganism, name the trade,
(37:07) even if I lose every point in a debate like that, I don't care. It only makes
(37:12) me better for the next time if I come up against the worldview. It's never bothered me to lose debates ever. In
(37:20) this case though, I think if you had just calmed down, we could have walked through it, right? You would have had
(37:25) some pretty good points that she could have made. But what she did instead, like when when you said that [ __ ] about
(37:32) not that was mind-blowing to me. Now, I'm actually happy if you want to take a step back and you want to talk about NT.
(37:38) I'm actually happy to do that, but just don't spur the [ __ ] out and freak out. It's a better experience for me and the
(37:44) audience. Do you want to do that? No, we could have a nice good faith linear discussion. Like there's no
(37:49) issues for me. Okay, good. But I just I do want to be clear. There was no spuring out.
(37:55) It was just making sure you didn't say No, dude. You completely sping out, bro. You were going full Jerry Springer like
(38:02) three or four times, dude. Three or four times you had to be reigned in from your Jerry Springeresque spur. Repeating
(38:07) yourself seven times in a row. You hear the rain around me? It's pretty loud. Can you guys hear it?
(38:15) again. Dude, sometimes I think this guy just his own [ __ ] voice. I don't want it to mess up the audio.
(38:21) Any Anyway, you you were freaking out pretty hard at the beginning of this. Yeah, you've calmed down. You've calmed down a lot now, but you were freaking out
(38:28) earlier. Yeah. I know. We could keep it like this the rest of the discussion. That's fine. But
(38:33) yeah, but why was the what was the point? What was the point of that? I don't even understand like what
(38:40) I've seen some of your videos. cuz you have this like tendency to interject and over. Okay, hang on. I think I I think I got the clip. Hang on. For a proposition.
(38:47) Truthmaker being who? The person who's making the proposition. No. Truth makers don't have to be whoms.
(38:52) They can be anything, right? The truth maker for the proposition. This tree is
(38:58) in this location. The truth maker for that proposition would be if that tree is in that location.
(39:04) Okay. So truth maker here, you're not saying the truth maker is the mind who's saying that.
(39:10) No, the truth maker is not the mind who's saying it. The truth maker is the tree being in existence. That's So then you're saying that the tree
(39:17) would exist absent a mind. Yeah. And that's a knowledge claim.
(39:23) But no, it's it just played the clip here. I'm going to send it to you though in case you
(39:29) probably couldn't I know you probably couldn't hear it, but I am um going to right now
(39:35) send you the clip and prove to you that you did in fact say that. And that'll be the end of this.
(39:40) Yes, I'll just send it to you. But I just played it on stream for the audience and now you know. Uh but hang on. I just downloaded it.
(39:47) I'm sending I promise I'm sending it to you right now. Yeah. Um
(39:53) boom. Uh what's your what's your handle in this Discord again? I'm sorry. Uh Saucy Sauy.
(39:59) Okay, hang on. He's the only one with the with the mic uh unmuted than me.
(40:06) Okay, here you go, Saucy. Um, thank you very much. How do I DM you here? You know what?
(40:13) I'll give it to Mr. E and he can DM. Oh, I have it. I sent it to you. I can't send it over Discord. It's too
(40:19) big. Oh, it's too big. Saucy, how can I send this clip to you? Saucy, go on Rumble and rewind the
(40:25) stream and just listen to it yourself. I'm going to I'm going to You just played it on stream, right? I have
(40:30) I literally just played it on stream. Yes. literally just played it.
(40:36) And now you got to pay up, bro. Because you did say it. And you bet me a thousand bucks you didn't say it.
(40:43) So now you got to pay up. You can send that through the dono chat, by the way.
(40:51) The link is pinned to the top of the YouTube chat. But you literally said, "No, that's not
(40:58) a knowledge claim." And then immediately contradicted that by saying it was. is really strange.
(41:12) That's why you don't spur, bro. Don't spur into base. It's bad. Bad to do. Don't do it. This turned out to be a pretty good
(41:18) invasion, Andrew. Yeah, it was fun. Yeah.
(41:39) Yeah, he could give 200 subs, too. That would be fine. I'm just fine with him just acknowledging that he said that. I'm
(41:46) fine with that long as he acknowledges that he Hey, I did say that. It was a stupid thing to say. Obviously.
(41:53) Obviously stupid. I got way There we go. I just listened to it. Yeah, there you go. You Yeah. Yeah. Do you think that's what you
(42:00) claimed I said? Oh, bro. Yes. Just be Just be his good faith. Just be
(42:06) good. Yes. Yes. Yes. That's what you That's what I claimed you said and that's exactly what you said. Yes.
(42:11) Yeah. That's That's false. That's not what you claimed. I said, but that doesn't really matter. Okay, hang on. I'll pull the clip. I'll
(42:17) tell you what. I tell you what. I'll pull up the clip of me claiming it, too. And then But you you owe me a thousand
(42:22) bucks. Okay. But H, go ahead and grab that, too. And then and then he'll send me the thousand
(42:29) bucks. That's it. Was that what you think we were actually really talking about before that though,
(42:34) Andrew? This is going to stop, dude. The is I want to be clear.
(42:40) Do you think that's enough? Oh, that would be a first. Yeah. Do you think that's
(42:45) Look, can can the female Let's just Let's just say let's let's just assume for a second. Look, Andrew,
(42:52) if we're going to keep this good faith, yeah, I'm going to keep it good faith. I'm going to keep it good faith. Just listen to what listen to what I'm saying
(42:57) to you. Even Even if it were the case that both of us were completely wrong. What you said here was that what I just played
(43:05) and then immediately contradicted it after by saying, "No, I never claimed that at all." Even though I gave it back
(43:11) to you verbatim, cuz I actually take notes as we're talking. I I don't know if you know this or not, but I do this.
(43:17) I do know you take notes. And you and you you did in fact say that. And I think you owe me a bunch of
(43:22) money, bro. You didn't say that. That's not what you said. I Well, I did, though.
(43:30) Okay. And I'm gonna give you the clip for that, too. I'll give you the clip for that, too. When I re when I re and when I asked you specifically, are you you're
(43:36) saying that's a knowledge claim? No. And then you seconds later when I said, "Wait, it's not a knowledge claim for
(43:42) you to say that." You were like, "No, no, no. That is a knowledge claim." So, that's you contradicting yourself.
(43:48) I know exactly. No, no, no, no. I know exactly what the clarification was. Oh, I said the hypothetical that was
(43:53) stipulated is not a knowledge claim. I said, if you're asking me, do I know I'm stipulating the hypothetical this way? That's a knowledge claim. That's what I
(43:59) said. No, that was a qualification that came much later actually a couple of minutes after. Yeah, that was No, that was the
(44:05) qualification. It was probably And here, let me can I ask you to if you to be honest with me like be totally honest with me, right?
(44:12) Don't lie to me. Are people right now as you're debating with me DMing you and you're reading the DMs from people who
(44:19) are on your side? Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
(44:26) No way, bro. And so, so what happened is a lot of the times that you're giving these qualifiers like a lot of a lot of the
(44:32) times that you're giving these qualifiers, the qualifiers aren't even yours. You're giving me qualifiers from other people. I'm not even debating you.
(44:38) I'm debating with 14 people. No, no, no, no. You asked me if I'm reading DMs from people who support me. They're telling you me. Look, I could
(44:45) just I'll read the DMs. Hold on. Yeah, I'll read them. He's just going to read the clip cut out. Hold on. This is from
(44:51) This is from Can I say the name of the person is from? Sure. Yeah. This is from Lemons Are yummy,
(44:56) too. The clip cut out the second you said no. Feel like they did that to remove content. You made him look dumb. You're funny as [ __ ] I'm going back to
(45:02) bed, but good night, King. No, no, no. Read read the debate help they're giving you. No, there there isn't any. You literally
(45:09) just said that there was You literally just said there was. Dude, no. You asked me if I was getting messages from supporters.
(45:15) I said, "Are you getting messages from supporters for debate help?" And you said yes.
(45:20) No. You didn't say. Okay. So then I'll ask you I'll just ask you directly. I'll ask directly. I'll
(45:25) ask directly. I'll ask directly. Did you get any messages which you read from other people in terms of this debate
(45:32) that were sending you information that you could use in this debate? No. single. Not a single person.
(45:40) Not a single one. No, the closest thing I got to that was an Ann debates, the one who bullied you on live, by the way.
(45:46) She just told me that she was recording the entire thing on the Whatever podcast. I didn't watch though. She lost that whole exchange.
(45:52) Totally. Yeah. That one wasn't even close. Okay. I got another message from [ __ ]
(45:58) He just asked me if I was debating you. I said yes. And then he said, "Yeah, I'm watching." I got the DMs from Ann. She
(46:03) just told me to Nobody Nobody after the stream is gonna send me DMs of them having sent you DMs
(46:09) that you read, right? That's not going to happen cuz that's going to make you look real bad if that happens, bro. No, they could they could all send all
(46:16) of us to you. Oh, and then there's May here. Saucy. He said saucy yo on ass
(46:21) cool. This isn't even intelligible. It's saucy. You on ass cool wit wig gg. I
(46:27) don't know if we could say that there. Okay. Oh, and then we got my boy Seth here. He just keeps saying, "Shout me out." I'm not gonna do that though. You
(46:34) asked me not to. But yeah, those are some of the DMs I got. Yeah, I did. And it it it's I got the idea. Let's do a watch party
(46:40) the whole debate so we can go over. Yeah, that wasn't to be malicious, by the way. The only reason I asked that is
(46:47) because it protects the integrity of my channel. You understand that, right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not going to shout. Oh,
(46:52) and then we got another one from my homie Star. She said, "I'm bullying you." My boy Jarp said, "Bully the mod
(46:58) more." They don't like you, bro. You haven't bullied anybody.
(47:03) Oh, we got we got my girl Glock in here. W Glock. Yes, sir. Uh, she just said you're stupid. We got
(47:10) my boy Ice here. Ice said you're dumb. Glock said I'm stupid. Oh, no. Glock didn't say you're stupid.
(47:16) That was me adding that in. She just DM'd me. Keep it up, King. And we got Linda here. So, so you're lying. So,
(47:21) you're just continuously lying. No, no. I confused I confused the DMs. My boy Linda here. You confused what you were the thing you
(47:27) were looking at reading. I got a DM. I got a DM from All right. How long are we going to do this, dude?
(47:32) I got a DM from Linda as I was reading. Nobody gives a [ __ ] about your [ __ ] stupid DMs from Linda. Oh, my bestie Linda here said, "Besty
(47:38) killing it right now. Andrew stupid. Keep it up, King W." Well, I mean, you clarify what they
(47:43) said. Here's here's the thing, though. You got caught and I played it live and now you
(47:49) know and you owe me some money. But anyway, I appreciated the conversation. You played it. You ain't got $1,000. You'd have to have
(47:55) $1,000 to be able to [ __ ] pay you. That is fair. Well, you Okay, great. I'm going to go definitely listen to it.
(48:00) Yeah, go listen to it. All right. Anyway, but you you done with this [ __ ] idiot? Yeah, I'm done. But anyway, you have a
(48:06) wonderful evening, man. I hope you got whatever you think you were looking for out of this.
(48:14) Oh, he thinks he did. He thinks it's a massive W for him. Well, yeah, the Sparkleys always do, but
(48:19) then the clips come out and it doesn't appear that way to anybody else. It's funny how that works, isn't it?
(48:25) When you answer a question. Oh. Oh, no. 15 circle jerkers in a random Discord that's always on the
(48:31) verge of getting banned. Is they don't they don't agree with you, Andrew. What What are you going to do? I don't know. I was just trying to be
(48:37) good faith about it. I always thought NT was an interesting question and I'm always happy to engage with it. But the
(48:43) thing is is like once you start [ __ ] freaking out, like if he didn't freak out, I wouldn't have been able to catch him and all that [ __ ] but he freaked
(48:50) out. That's the way it works. Sometimes people freak the [ __ ] out, dude.
(48:55) But anyway, I got to get going because it's uh 1:30 in the morning and we started at what, like 9. So
(49:01) Oh, yeah. And I I think I think we did manage to
(49:06) uh get all of the [ __ ] dono boards here. Oh yeah, we shattered the dono goal. Yeah, I think we did. So anyway,
(49:12) best damn chat in the business right there. True, true. But anyway, guys, I'm going
(49:17) to get out of here. I hope all of you have a wonderful evening. Um, you know,
(49:23) the honestly if if that guy would have chilled out, I would have I would have been happy. Like I've done this with
(49:28) vegan gains with all these people. I'm happy to discuss uh philosophy with
(49:34) vegans. It's uh like that's fine to do, but you got you got to not freak the [ __ ] out, dude. Just don't freak out.
(49:41) Nobody can even understand what you're saying. Um anyway, can you set up a
(49:46) raid, Mr. You're enigmatic. Yeah. Yeah. We'll set something up. I just went back to the Rumble stream. I'm not here.
(49:52) Yeah. Yeah. No, nobody cares, dude. You're done. Have a nice night. Bye-bye.
(49:57) This [ __ ] guy over here.
(50:02) Yeah. Well, he I mean, he was going to he was going to show me. Yeah. Tell your [ __ ] friends about it, not me.
(50:08) Yeah. I don't know. Uh, we got Speak Easy. We got Elf. Of
(50:14) course, there's always Elf. Uh, send over to Speak Easy. We haven't seen over that way in a long time. Yeah, he showed up right away. Okay. Tik
(50:22) Tok and open panel purge. Yeah. I think I think sometimes too uh
(50:27) people forget um that unlike unlike a lot of streamers
(50:34) uh if you get caught up right or you say something dumb or um you have some
(50:40) philosophy that's not tight in a certain area. I don't get upset about that and I
(50:45) never will get upset about that. That's how you [ __ ] engage in worldviews.
(50:51) And you're always going to come up against somebody who knows something you don't. And that's I'm fine with that, too. I don't think that happened in this
(50:57) case, but I'm fine with that, too. I think sometimes what happens is um
(51:03) people hyperfocus on refusing to take an L or refusing to acknowledge a hole in
(51:08) their worldview or refusing to engage in it. And that's where you end up getting in all kinds of trouble. I think it's
(51:15) too bad too because uh you know ask yourself where that's the community they're coming from. Uh well maybe not
(51:22) that community specifically but that's where NT came from. I mean he he made NT. He has the opposite view. His entire
(51:29) view the reason he got into philosophy was to try to make discourse between people better was to try to make
(51:35) discussions between people better. And it's too bad that so many of the people I think that that he would like if if he
(51:44) was like proverbally dead that the whole term roll over in your grave I I think
(51:49) would apply 100% to him there because his whole point of what he was always trying to accomplish was to make
(51:56) discourse and debates better. And I think uh I think it's too bad that um
(52:04) there's a lot of people who take away a lot of his foundational training to not make discourse better, but to make
(52:09) discourse worse.
