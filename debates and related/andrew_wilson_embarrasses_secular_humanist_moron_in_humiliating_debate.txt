(0:00) so I'm going to use the principles I don't have to use the specific Manifesto because I just I could just get into the
(0:06) Bible and ask how stoning people on the Sabbath because they went to work is good for society or how not letting
(0:12) women speak Andrew your Bible says that you can Stone you can beat your slave as much as you want as long as they can get
(0:18) up afterwards that comes for a good Society no I can tell you why Christianity is not good for
(0:23) society you have not given me any reason to do what I'm not going to do what I'm not going to do is engage with your
(0:30) personal interpretations of secular humanism because personal interpretations don't matter Collective
(0:35) decisions as a society is what matter so you individually deciding this is the prescription of secular humanism is not
(0:42) how secular humanism Works what you've done is said we have got a set of rules by God that we can set out by we've got
(0:49) a norm we've got a normative authority to go to but that normative Authority also drowned the entirety of humanity
(0:55) because they didn't he didn't like what they were doing to use a normal with authority that is a Psychopathic deity
(1:01) is a very silly thing to do we don't need a normative Authority we need Collective experiences and how that
(1:06) would affect humans in the future got it so I just want to make sure I'll steal man I'll steal man wait for the
(1:12) Applause come [Applause] on thank you let's hear some real
(1:23) Applause all right guys come on my turn come on louder all right we'll return
(1:28) toate and Andrew Wilson debates Craig I don't know his last name it just says Craig ffe in a brutal debate where
(1:36) Andrew Wilson completely owns Craig they debate Christianity or secular humanism
(1:41) and well Craig here just doesn't stand a chance this is highly entertaining but don't just take my word for it let's see
(1:47) for yourself this is a courtesy of modern day debates let's see how this goes down of secular humanism which
(1:54) doesn't align with what everyone else thinks secular humanism is you claim I don't know what an ad hom and things are
(1:59) Trust me I debate flaters all the time that's uh but yeah I don't have to argue against your personal prescriptions we
(2:05) can just talk about what secular humanis is better for society none of the things that you mentioned are about Society
(2:12) they're just what you don't like about secular humanism um what I'm just going to ask you is very simple humanism
(2:19) humanism yeah what I'm going to ask you Andrew is very simp how long you going to filibuster dude I just I was literally about to ask a question if you
(2:25) you can calm down and let me finish my sentence then you can respond right what I am going to ask you St sping Craig
(2:30) what I'm going to ask St Craig I'm like three Craig stoping calm down we'll get
(2:36) to the question go ahead Craig you need a moment Andrew okay CRA if you need a moment to like take a breath that's absolutely fine Craig this is a great
(2:43) time to ask the question what I'm going to ask you Andrew is because you failed to do that in your opening could you explain to us why Christianity is better
(2:50) for society um instead of just attacking your own views so let's make this really
(2:55) simple right so Craig says here he says well that's your interpretation of the
(3:01) humanist Manifesto you see the problem everybody's gonna have an interpretation of the humanist
(3:06) Manifesto thus if everybody has an interpretation of the humanist Manifesto including me I we can make prescriptions
(3:14) based on it Craig so now I'm making prescriptions based on the humanist Manifesto for what
(3:19) Society okay you are asking about Christianity I told you that Christian ethics are better for society because I
(3:26) can refute the prescriptions made in the humanist Manifesto that I just made in the humanist Manifesto you Craig cannot
(3:34) refute a single prescription I made off a single tenant in the humanist Manifesto using your own Manifesto do
(3:43) you understand that yes Andrew I completely understand so doesn't that haveen yeah again the pattern that I see
(3:48) with all these secular humanists or atheists or what have you is that they all want the consensus they want want oh
(3:54) well we'll just know what's right and what's not like we'll just know and so Andrew always has to make the point like
(3:59) well no we need if we don't have a defining guide book here then where do we get our morals and ethics from
(4:05) society entailment a societal entailment Craig would you like me to answer the question or are you just going to talk when I talk I can't wait go ahead um do
(4:11) you need a minute to calm down it's fine we can take two minutes and you can yeah it's fine yeah get to the answer please
(4:18) yeah so again um what you haven't done is explain why Christianity is better you just said I think it's better
(4:23) because I don't like secular humanism that's not explaining why Christianity what ethics what morals about
(4:30) Christianity make it better for society what you've done is simply attack secular humanism you haven't given me a
(4:36) single reason why Christianity specifically is better what you said is
(4:41) Christianity is better because I don't like these things about secet humanism and I want you to tell me why these
(4:47) things about secular humanism is bad but Andrew you aren't here to attack secular humanism you are here to defend
(4:52) Christianity so you failed to do it in your intro so can you just give me a single reason specifically with without
(5:00) attacking secular humanism because that's what flat earther do you're acting like a flat earther so flat earther attack the globe instead of
(5:06) saying why Flat Earth is better so instead of attacking secular humanism could you give me a reason why
(5:11) Christianity is the thing that is better for society tell me what ethics what morals yeah because when I make
(5:17) prescriptions based on a humanist Manifesto I can debunk those prescriptions using Christian ethics you
(5:24) can't debunk those prescriptions using the humanist Manifesto that's why it's better okay here I'll show you let's
(5:31) give you an example if we can go through these we can get through that'd be wonderful yeah because you know what I would like to hear is reasons why
(5:37) Christianity is better not reasons why you dislike SEC humanism this isn't about feelings this about reasons let's
(5:42) do this perhaps so that we're not talking past each other are you willing to steal man my argument here Can you
(5:48) steal man it well uh your argument would be based on um your particular version
(5:54) of Christianity which is um which again Can you steal man my argument
(5:59) Craig which argument the one I just made Craig your your argument is you don't like secular humanism uh these are the
(6:06) things I don't like about secular humanism so I going I'm going to say secular humanism can do these things and
(6:12) that means that secular humanism is bad that's what you said Andrew uh no that's not what he said he said that
(6:19) Christianity is better because he could debunk human secularism with Christianity but you can't debunk
(6:26) Christianity using secular humanism that's what he said that's strong uh
(6:31) that's steel Manning the argument correct you have given me a list of things that you think you can prescribe based on the humanist Manifesto right
(6:38) that's what you've done correct uhhuh right so therefore you are saying well these are prescriptions that I think I
(6:43) can give based on secular humanism why do I think Christianity is better what's my argument Christianity you haven't you
(6:49) haven't said yet you've said what you've said Andrew is that Christianity can debunk these things but you haven't
(6:54) explained how it can debunk them give me specifics related to Christianity debunk the things about SEC humanis you don't
(7:01) like so far you've given me no reasons why Christianity is better greig I'll do it the prescription for one do you agree
(7:08) that that the first tenant for secular humanism is knowledge of the world is derived by observation experimentation
(7:13) and rational analysis uh that's what I said in if we go back to the slide which you didn't present any uh why why do I
(7:19) need to present a slide well it's because you know we've got a big thing up there to present slides and I thought it' be nice to I have a slides show so
(7:26) anyway yeah because one of us prepares for the arguments the other one you know I didn't prepare for the arguments
(7:31) because I have a slideshow yeah Andrew you've done a million debates like this this is my second I thought I'd do some research and prepare and you know give
(7:38) something for the audience to look at but you know can we get back to this do do you agree yes or no tenant one
(7:44) knowledge I did say yes maybe you have problems hearing but carry on Greg you need to calm down bro oh I'm I'm fine
(7:49) I'm waiting for your calm what I'm doing Andrew is I'm waiting for your argument but yet I just I just want to make sure
(7:54) that we're we're clear yeah we are clear so you haven't yet given an Argent for your position okay so my my prescription
(8:00) to that Craig is the birth rate is low therefore all women must be forcibly bred and experiments must be conducted
(8:08) on them to maximize fertility and thereby maximize human flourishing because science and that is good now
(8:14) Craig that's what I read from tenant one right can you use any of the tenants in
(8:20) secular the the humanist Manifesto 3 to debunk that prescription or tell me why
(8:25) that prescription's bad so still no reasons why Christianity is bad that's what I'm asking here what you're saying
(8:31) is explain why this is good I yet to hear Let me expl you said you can debunk
(8:36) that using Christianity then I'll explain yes so under Christian ethics forcibly locking up women and doing
(8:43) horrible things to them would be a violation of God's law it would be a violation of Jesus Christ's law to man
(8:50) so because of that Christians would say no you can't lock women up and forcibly breed and experiment on them you're not
(8:56) allowed to do that Craig now Craig I just gave you a demonstration of how
(9:02) Christianity would debunk this now Craig can you use the humanist Manifesto to do it great Do It um well so your
(9:09) prescription is a straw man of secular humanism it's right this dude owns
(9:18) himself the more that he talks and he does quite a bit of talking so if I were him I would only talk when needed
(9:24) because he does not do himself any favors I mean personally that's why I think this whole secularism is a
(9:29) is a this secular humanism thing is a losing argument I mean there's just no winning with this it's like trying to
(9:36) argue that men can become women and vice versa like it that's not true there's no winning with this why right because
(9:43) secular humanism doesn't say does you've gone um that there's a low birth rate therefore we have to do this secular
(9:49) humanism doesn't say there's a low birth rate it you know read the prescript read the tenent again for
(9:56) me it says knowledge in the world is derived by observation experiment and
(10:02) rational analysis and then what was your prescription my prescription based on my interpretation of this is that the birth
(10:08) rate is low therefore all women must be forcibly bred experiments must be conducted on them to maximize fertility
(10:14) and therefore maximize human flourishing because science and that is good so
(10:20) you're saying that second humanism makes a low birth rate no I'm saying that the interpretation here prescriptively and
(10:26) what I'm reading is that this prescription would not not in any way counter that tenant well the fact that
(10:33) there's low birth rates isn't a bad thing it's not low birth rates it's lower birth rates um is is locking women
(10:39) up and breeding them a bad thing would that's not a bad thing or it is a bad thing when I'm in the middle of a
(10:44) sentence explaining something that's when youd be quiet and listen at maybe I know you're used
(10:50) to I'm way out line Craig I know if you let me finish my my thoughts it is would be yeah I know Andrew why can't you just
(10:56) shut up a minute and just let him talk a strong secular humanist is talking you know if I can finish what I'm saying
(11:02) okay go ahead so SEC humanism is about harm and locking people up and doing experiments on them is causing harm and
(11:07) they wouldn't do that um a lower birth rate doesn't necessarily mean that things are bad it just means that there
(11:13) is less people than having lots of people now an extremely large birth rate has many problems um so we can look at
(11:21) what large birth rates caused poverty um you know broken families people being homeless um you know lots of things like
(11:27) that so there's no reason secular humanism would if there is a low birth rate go and then lock people up and
(11:32) experiment on them because that is not necessarily A Bad Thing and having a slight slightly lower birth rate can actually help humans flourish as a
(11:38) second human is we're all about human flourishing and having a slightly lower birth rate will actually help because it
(11:45) um allows better standards of living less poverty Less Problems um less um you children being abandoned less family
(11:53) and societal problems from having too many people around so you have come up with your prescription which is a
(11:58) prescription I don't agree with so I don't have to accept your prescription yeah okay so so if I don't have to
(12:05) accept your prescription I don't even have to to debunk it that is your prescription and it's not what any secular humanism would say in fact that
(12:12) prescription is a logical impossibility based in secular humanism because it includes doing harm and secular
(12:18) humanists would not do something that includes harm so Andrew whether you realize it or not and whether your
(12:23) audience realizes it or not that prescription that you have come from your interpretation is a straw man of
(12:28) secular humanism a prescription to straw man your prescription is because your prescription is based on interpretation
(12:34) that no secular humanism would come to the conclusion of it is a logical impossibility that secular humanists
(12:40) would lock people up and do experiments on them so to think that a um humanist Manifesto could include that as a
(12:47) prescription means that you have no clue what secular humanism is and that's fine if you don't know what sec I just let
(12:53) you ramble for forever right um but so you Craig calm down now Okay carry on
(12:58) with your point sorry apologize knowledge of the world is derived by observation experimentation
(13:03) rational analysis this is a descriptive claim correct okay could do do we make
(13:09) prescriptive claims off of descriptive claims if you want if you want so if I
(13:14) were a humanist and I read that who whose interpretation would it be up to as to how it was applied or what the
(13:20) prescription was hang on hang on was I done calm down you ask the
(13:25) question what I'm asking you specifically is if it is the the case that the person reading it is going to
(13:31) be the person who makes the prescription Okay then if I make a prescription here
(13:37) and it's not debunked by any of the rest of the humanist Manifesto and you're going to some external Source in your
(13:43) case well you see uh there's a logical impossibility because a secular humanist
(13:48) wouldn't do that it doesn't tell us Craig I'm giving you a prescription based on your first tenant hang on stop
(13:56) based on your very first tenant I need you to Ed the actual Manifesto itself to
(14:01) tell me how it conflicts with that prescription what you're doing is you're saying I don't like that prescrip that's
(14:08) nobody gives a what you like show me in the humanist Manifesto where it is that it actually debunks this
(14:14) prescription or says this prescription is wrong or says this prescription isn't humanist what I'm claiming is that that
(14:20) is humanism okay that is a humanist Doctrine you need to show me within the humanist Manifesto how it's not I
(14:26) already did that by explaining that the SEC the human Manifesto doesn't say harm it is about not doing harm and again
(14:33) Andrew you are going back to your own interpretation now second humanism doesn't have one person's interpretation
(14:39) to take into account secular humanism is based on a collective the shared experiences we we don't take the Bible
(14:47) we we don't take one person we need you in the audience to remain quiet please we don't take one person's
(14:52) interpretation and say that's what we're going to stick to okay we don't go this is the thing that we say because this
(14:58) person wrote this and that is what we stick to as humanists we have Collective experiences we will get together and say
(15:03) do you write them in a Manifesto yes because a group of collective experience kidding you have
(15:09) Collective experiences and you put them in a Manifesto you want me to answer the question or are you going to jump in let
(15:15) how long are you going to take to answer the question I let you talk for a while to give the question so let me are you afraid of me answering the question I
(15:21) just want you to ask I'm try Andrew if you're afraid of answering the question no it's just that you're using so much
(15:27) words to say absolutely nothing nothing and also everything you're saying is is is not debunking anything Andrew is
(15:33) saying it's not no one's afraid of you talking in fact uh if we just sat here and listen to you talk all day we would
(15:39) see that you're an absolute who doesn't know what he's talking about it it would be actually be in Andrew's
(15:44) advantage to let you talk but the thing is we only got so much time Craig there's only so much time in the world we got things to do uh we can only hear
(15:51) you say the same things and Andrew is telling you so much if you're afraid of me question
(15:58) hold on one second let me pull you apart just to reset Here Andrew can you ask your question
(16:05) one more time yeah it's very it's really simple okay yes I agree you guys all have Collective experiences and you put
(16:11) them in a thing called the humanist Manifesto which you just agreed to using this humanist Manifesto of your
(16:17) Collective experiences I gave a prescription can you also use that human Manifesto to debunk that prescription
(16:24) tell me why that prescription is wrong using the manifesto itself the man I think you can't I think you can't do it
(16:31) Craig because it doesn't tell you it doesn't tell you anything once again go ahead show me show me in the
(16:38) manifesto itself where that prescription conflicts with humanism because I'm saying it's a greater form of humanism
(16:44) than your humanism are you done yes go ahead okay now take a deep breath and let me talk okay good
(16:51) boy calm right once again human Manifesto says no harm it's about not
(16:57) doing harm it's about human flourishing okay I'm not going to use the exact words because interpretations are a
(17:03) thing but as sector humanists we would get together and say how do we deal with this thing it's not a particular
(17:09) prescription of things that you have to do it is a ethical framework you would take the framework and you would say how
(17:15) do we deal with this problem you would get together as a society and using our shared experiences empathy towards each
(17:21) other the want to do less harm how do we deal with this issue secular humanists do not do harm that is the idea of
(17:27) secular humanism to not do harm flourish so I'm going to use the principles I don't have to use the specific Manifesto
(17:33) because I just I could just get into the Bible and ask how stoning people on the Sabbath because they went to work is
(17:39) good for society or how not letting women speak Andrew your Bible says that you can Stone you can beat your slave as
(17:45) much as you want as long as they can get up afterwards that comes for a good Society no I can tell you why Christianity is not good for society
(17:52) right you have not given me any reason to do what I'm not going to do what I'm not going to do is engage with your
(17:58) personal interpretations of secular humanism because personal interpretations don't matter Collective
(18:04) decisions as a society is what matter so you individually deciding this is the prescription of secular humanism is not
(18:11) how secular humanism Works what you've done is said we have got a set of rules by God that we can set out by we've got
(18:18) a norm we've got a normative authority to go to but that normative Authority also drowned the entirety of humanity
(18:24) because they didn't he didn't like what they were doing to use a normal with authority that is ay AIC deity is a very
(18:30) silly thing to do we don't need a normative Authority we need Collective experiences and how that would affect
(18:35) humans in the future got it so I just want to make sure I'll steal man I'll steal man wait for the
(18:40) Applause come [Applause] on thank you let's hear some real
(18:52) Applause all right guys come on my turn come on louder all right we'll return
(18:57) toate we'll return to the debate go ahead Andrew I just wanted to
(19:04) I just wanted to move back to this uh very quickly I just want to make sure that I steal man your position in the
(19:09) best faith I possibly can you failed so far okay that's why I'm trying again so
(19:15) let's say you're very trying yes when you when you say it's the collective experience of us that matters yes and
(19:22) the interpretation of this framework it's the collective experiences or and how that relates to the framework okay
(19:28) in the collective experience of these of these people utilizing this framework they would be able to utilize
(19:35) this framework to debunk that prescription correct I just did you utilize Collective collective
(19:44) experience to debunk my prescription yeah collective experience of people being U locked up and kidnapped and
(19:49) experimented on being a thing to do the collective experiences would say that Humanity wouldn't do that because
(19:55) the collective experien of humanity knows that that is a bad thing to do that caus is harm and doesn't help people there is no way that secular
(20:03) humanism would lock people up and experiment on them because that causes harm secular humanism does not cause
(20:09) harm we would not find a solution to something that includes purposely
(20:14) causing people harm so you are coming up with this prescription because you do not understand what SEC humanism is you
(20:20) seem to think that secular humanism is anything when I ask a question please don't take two minutes right just give a
(20:25) quick answer Sor if you if you struggle to if you got as you watch a lot of shorts should I play like a video of
(20:31) like Subway Surfers as I talk at the same time is that gonna help so anyway back to this the reason the reason is is
(20:37) because we can't get anywhere if you filibuster on a single answer forever and ever and ever we again if you got short attention span Andre that's not my
(20:43) problem so the point the point is is that if it is the case that it's just due to uh collective experience using
(20:49) this as just a framework what's to stop the collective experience for making prescriptions just like mine based on
(20:55) whatever their Collective experiences are it's a logical possibility stop let me well can I finish asking it okay okay
(21:04) so anyway what's to actually just to stop the collective from coming up with
(21:09) well for one thing they can change the manifesto itself right it's already been changed multiple times so it's the Bible
(21:14) multiple times nobody's disputing that but what I'm saying is that inside of this if you have a collection of people
(21:20) who say for instance to I don't know lock up all children right prescriptively that's what humanist
(21:26) decide is going to help the most when it comes to to knowledge of the world being derived by observation experimentation
(21:32) and rational analysis they're using rational analysis to determine children need to be locked up until they get to a
(21:37) certain age what inside hang on what inside of the humanist Manifesto itself
(21:43) is demonstrating that that should not happen what is it what can you point to anything in it the reduction of harm
(21:50) Andrew you keep com which is where you keep com where is it the right again I'm not going to use the exact words that
(21:56) are in it because because they're not in it because I'm not going to use the see and this
(22:02) also too um this point do whatever causes harm that's what we won't do but
(22:07) that's subjective there's no book or rule thing that you could appeal to to say what harm is or what harm isn't okay
(22:15) this guy's saying well we would all come to the conclusion that locking people up and experimenting on them is wrong oh
(22:20) okay well now do covid some people were saying having people locked down in their homes and and forcing people to
(22:28) get get an experimental jab some people was arguing that was harmful but other
(22:33) people maybe Craig I don't know were arguing no no no it's good it's a good thing we should do it even though that
(22:40) was causing people harm yeah so with that there was no book or rule book that
(22:45) we could go to to Point N it says here that we're wrong we're by these ethics this guide book of Ethics right here to
(22:51) show that this is wrong and we were at the millions of people were at the mercy of a consensus of the few people who got
(22:58) together and their shared experiences got together and decided we needed to be locked down what about scenarios like
(23:04) that Craig and what it represents is to not do harm you keep coming up with things that are harmful right let me get
(23:10) this through to you secular humanism will not do something that purposely causes harm you keep saying who
(23:16) determines what harm is can you let me talk who determines what harm is CG the collective experiences and empathy so
(23:22) collective experience says this isn't harmful Collective experiences say that it is harmful though that is what Collective exp if it didn't Craig but
(23:29) what what if the collective experience of these people say not harmful but they do Andrew but if they didn't though right well in the same way what if God
(23:35) said that you could do whatever if you did answer my question well but Collective experiences don't it's a logical impossibility under the frame un
(23:41) answer of the first loses Craig answer my question under the framework of secular humanism that is a logical
(23:47) impossibility to do right I do not have to answer things that will never happen let's start with what is logically what
(23:52) does logical impossibility mean it means that is something that is logically impossible as a conclusion can't use the
(23:58) words to describe the words Craig yes you can what does logical impossibility mean it means that it is something that
(24:03) would not come as a result of conclusions of what's happening if you look at the overall if you look at the
(24:09) overall conclusions of what secular humanism gives and look at that the outcome would be question is what does
(24:15) logical mean I'm trying to answer it means that it is something that if you
(24:21) look at the overall conclusion of something and look at it logically the outcome is an impossibility if you look
(24:27) at all the conclusions of secular humanism what tries to promote the logical impossibility of um locking
(24:33) people up and causing harm comes from looking at those of the entirety of secular humanism you keep coming up with
(24:39) questions of what if they locked people up what if they did that it's not something that would happen in secutive
(24:45) is Wolverine from the X-Men logically impossible uh Wolverine is from the X-Men specifically um the the first the
(24:52) character The Wolverine from the X-Men the adamantium claw the healing power system is that logically impossible um
(24:57) use copenhagen's interpretation of quantum mechanics no no it's not logically so Wolverine is not logically
(25:03) impossible right it could exist in a number of universes as far as we know what is logically impossible is that a bunch of people can't get together and
(25:09) change what the meaning of harm is uh well
(25:15) again but Andrew you are missing the point of what Collective experiences show us we look at Collective
(25:20) experiences throughout the world and we can see what harm is you are just saying well what if they change what harm is
(25:25) but as humans we know what what if they change what the meaning of har is Craig you got three words out there Andrew can
(25:31) you answer the damn question Craig I'm trying to Andrew and if you let me that would be wonderful oh well you see the thing is is that without answering the
(25:37) question the question never gets answered so we're never going to actually answer the question because answering the question is an unanswered question what are they change the
(25:44) definition of harm Craig yeah Andrew I'm trying to let me answer the question they won't change the definition of oh
(25:49) they won't no but Wolverine's logically possible so secular humanism looks at what happens as experiences and
(25:54) throughout Humanity we can know that locking people up and doing harm is a bad thing because it makes bad things
(26:01) happens it makes people unhappy it causes harm it makes Society a worse place what about when it doesn't cause
(26:06) harm like when we lock criminals up so the idea of locking criminals up
(26:12) at least in you know the decent does it reduce harm Craig yes when you yes wait so so wait so you're just saying lock
(26:20) people locking people up is going to reduce harm am I allow talk am I allowed to talk well CRA am I allowed to talk
(26:27) and talk yes great you're allow allow to talk yes great Andre but how long are you going to talk am Andrew allowed to
(26:34) talk for how long at once though okay so you are being a flat earther here oh
(26:39) you're being an ethical flat earther what you're doing is you're not allowing the other person to talk and just laughing and you want to answer any
(26:45) questions I'm trying to answer the question but every time I do that's not answers filibuster no you don't understand that it's answers Andrew
(26:50) maybe because you're not a very intelligent person but I'm not sure one day Craig I'll get to your level well so
(26:56) would you like me to answer any of your questions or are you the answers here's the thing I'll make a deal with you if you treat this in good
(27:03) faith and you actually answer my questions I'll actually answer yours but don't fill a buster hang on don't Fil A
(27:08) Buster and don't lie simple can is it is it not the case that people change what
(27:13) the definition of harm is all the time and by necessity they have to do that
(27:19) Greg right you have to change what the definition of harm is so when you say Andrew it's logically impossible that
(27:25) people would change the definition of harm so that you could lock women enough to do XYZ to them that's not actually
(27:30) logically impossible is it under the tendance of sector humanism yes it is then show me where sect humanism it's
(27:36) about not doing harm and show me where show me where the in the humanist document it conflicts with this since it
(27:43) says we can change our definition of what harm is anytime we want but the definition of harm is what it is we know
(27:50) what harm is no we don't know what harm is yes we do our Collective experiences shows if we make people unhappy if we
(27:57) make people hurt make them die we make them injured that is harm and as Society we can get together and say well we
(28:02) don't want those bad things to happen what makes people depressed what makes people Andrew I am in the middle of answering your question and it can
(28:09) reduce harm to Andrew I will answer your question but you might need to let me get there go ahead set my set my stage
(28:16) calm down the problem is that you do not want to hear the answers you just want your script I'm not going to stick to
(28:21) your scpt get to the answer go right do not talk let me answer because I yeah
(28:27) Andrew's the one that's yapping for ages yeah it's it's Andrew who just doesn't know when to shut up yes thank you Craig
(28:35) uh what do you think about this so far sound off in the comment section below smash that like button if you haven't
(28:41) already and if you are enjoying this let's continue good boy right so doing
(28:47) harm is everyone knows what harm is everyone knows that harm that's what's in question see here we go I let that's
(28:54) literally what's in question is whether or not everyone knows what harm TR lay I'm trying to lay the foundation for my answer if you let me get more than three
(29:00) or four words out a few sentences at a time Andrew then this debate can happen but you just want to overt talk me give
(29:06) you a chance Craig go ahead 30 seconds thank you right so as a collective we can get together and say what makes you
(29:12) unhappy what makes you hurt what stops you from advancing as a human and that is harm we can get a bunch of injured
(29:19) people together and say how did that happen this is harm how do we stop these things this is harm what makes you
(29:24) unhappy this is harm and we can look at what makes that happen you are trying to come up with um a a situation where harm
(29:31) can just be changed and we can make harm not mean having harm but that's not what
(29:36) secular humanism does because as a society as collective um as a collective as individuals we would come up with to
(29:42) not do that to make everyone happy people aren't going to be happy if we do that second humanism wants people being
(29:48) happy okay then Craig I just have a simple question for you when it comes to child transition surgery right we have a
(29:56) split on whether or not that's harm ful who should I side
(30:02) with who should I side with uh the position of um that is
(30:09) something that I wouldn't want to get into because am I allowed to get my thoughts
(30:14) out what about harm yeah my harm I didn't say I wasn't going to I would say
(30:20) it's something I wouldn't want to but again I'm not allowed to get my words out here right so as a collective
(30:25) Society we would get together and see what happened and that is going through changes at the moment personally
(30:30) personally I don't agree with that right um and the the current position within
(30:35) SE humanists seems to be that allowing children to transition is something that causes harm right that and that is the
(30:42) position that I personally hold when I look at the evidence and what other second humanists are saying is that
(30:47) allowing children to transition causes harm because children are not at a place where they are able to make that
(30:53) decision their brain is not fully developed um and especially people with um uh we look at neurod Divergence who
(31:00) neurod Divergence actually have a much higher percentage of wanting to transition and things like that and that could be an effect of them being neuro
(31:06) Divergent so we have to look at individual cases but personally children in transition because they are not ready
(31:11) to make that position that decision their brains aren't fully developed until they're like the age of 25 so
(31:16) letting children do that before they have the ability to is in itself causing harm so so then what's going on here
(31:23) just so you understand I just demonstrated something very important to you you said we know what harm is yes
(31:29) our collective experience demonstrates what harm is then I ask you a simple question there's two different collections of people right now one who
(31:36) believes that this is very harmful and one like you who believes it's not very harmful which one of those is second
(31:42) which one of those well humanists themselves disagree Matt dillah Hunty who's a humanist for instance is right
(31:47) as we speak probably sucking lady balls right like that's that's actually true so hang on
(31:55) hang on hang on stop stop is though bro it's my turn my turn bro my turn calm down calm down BR calm down not mat calm
(32:03) down I didn't say you were right I'm not going to run away from a debate I didn't say you were I didn't tell you to run I didn't tell you anything calm down so
(32:09) anyway back to where we were what I'm saying is he's a humanist you're a humanist clearly you disagree
(32:15) about thises stop stop stop just ask does he say specifically that he thinks
(32:21) a transition calm down I'm just asking a question does that is that what he says calm yes but anyway calm down I don't
(32:26) think that's humanist humanist themselves okay humanists themselves disagree stop bro would you chill out
(32:33) for two seconds they they did themselves disagree on even what a man is they
(32:38) disagree on the prescriptions for children no they don't they yes they do and they disagree about all of these
(32:44) things within the very same framework you're talking about the thing is is like that's fine you can grant that
(32:51) humanist can disagree as the peanut gallery was telling you you can make the same criticism about the Bible
(32:56) theologically people disagree all the time totally fair argument what's not a fair argument is for you to say that
(33:02) it's logically impossible for us to redetermining under humanism of course
(33:07) we can redetermined experiences Humanity show
(33:15) us what harm is and either he's pretending not to understand or he really doesn't he keeps going back to W
(33:20) collectively by human experiences and stuff like that but Andrew is saying that everyone's human experiences are
(33:27) different so who decides at the end which is the one that's actually correct
(33:32) what is the harmful thing he just said well it's wrong to lock people up and experiment on them but clearly PE there
(33:39) are some times where people might think it's Justified like with Co there were people who thought doing that was
(33:45) justified because it's for some greater good there are other people who thought
(33:50) that that was wrong and that was actually doing harm both sides were trying to come at it from a point we're
(33:55) trying to that we're trying to prevent harm this side thought they were trying to prevent harm this side thought they
(34:01) were trying to prevent harm they both have their own definitions of what caused harm and what was more harmful so
(34:10) Andrew's whole point is where can you go to decide what is harmful and what isn't
(34:16) because us as human beings can't decide on our own what is harmful and what
(34:22) isn't harmful it is not black and white we need some sort of of higher power
(34:28) which is why these atheists sound stupid when they say I don't need a sky Daddy to tell me what's Mor and what's not
(34:35) yeah you kind of do we all kind of do humans are selfish creatures sometimes
(34:42) we act out of our self-interest or sometimes our opinions differ on what is
(34:47) harmful and what isn't so when you could sometimes so you could turn to religion in this case Christianity to give you a
(34:56) moral ethics and moral framework with secular humanism you can't because secular humanism only relies on the
(35:04) human perspective it's like trying to play a football game and there's no rule
(35:09) book you can't do it it would be an unwatchable game it would be unplayable because if everyone there is just
(35:15) allowed to decide the rules on the spot it would be chaos but if you had an a a
(35:20) football rule book that tells you what you can and can't do better then the game is actually playable crazy here
(35:28) look like an absolute jackass and listen I've seen the whole debate to be fair he seems like a nice guy he just seemed
(35:33) like he was out of his depth and Andrew Wilson well was right again when it comes onto this whole Christianity
(35:40) debate if you want to see the full debate I have a link in the in the description below it is highly
