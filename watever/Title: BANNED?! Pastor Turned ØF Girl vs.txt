(4:41) you can take a second go over there drop us a sub we're almost so we can get like another YouTube plaque or whatever

(4:47) um before I have the guests introduce myself I just want to address a couple other things um so uh and it's been ongoing for a while now

(4:56) but um I've been having like chronic neck and back pain issues for many years recently had one of the worst flare-ups ever for my neck even with that

(5:03) three-week break I took it's been really bad uh so I'm not and have not been at 100 been dealing like I said dealing

(5:09) with it for a really long time basically operating at 50 um if I was at 100 just be much sharper

(5:15) quicker probably do like three or four shows a week but um you're still killing it Brian thank you yeah I try I try I

(5:22) persist even though I'm like in pain over here but um and it and honestly anyone who's ever had any neck issues

(5:28) often comes with headaches and brain fog so you know I see the comments some people are saying like I'm really not on

(5:33) point you guys aren't wrong it's just like hard for me to be as well spoken and articulate as I'd like to be just

(5:39) because I have like some brain fog and headache issues all the time so sometimes I get lost but I'm working on

(5:45) it um so but appreciate you guys who still support me and watch the show despite that which also leads me to this

(5:50) so the last show Chase was on because of the stress and because of some of the pain issues um I lost my cool

(5:57) and um I could have handled it way better basically something came up that I didn't really want to talk about it

(6:02) came up and um I kind of uh you know I I lost my cool I got upset at Chase I got

(6:08) upset at um Sam so uh I apologize I apologize to chase after the show just

(6:14) under enormous amount of stress so uh it was a little misdirected wish I handled it better but uh yeah so uh good to have

(6:21) Chase back we're the homies it was just it was just like a 30 second thing and the last podcast yeah I'm not tripping

(6:27) on it yeah so um Brian's trying to manage a lot here fam yeah there's a lot going on behind the scenes

(6:33) um and just you know trying to get 10 people to show up on time all that actually you know what one quick note

(6:39) there was a girl um who was gonna be on the show today and she said hey I'm gonna be 50 minutes

(6:45) late and you know I wish we could have accommodated her but you know I I have

(6:51) the girls meet at 6 PM we aim to go live at 7 pm oftentimes we end up being like 50 minutes

(6:57) late beyond that but uh you know she flew from Chicago I don't know

(7:04) my understand she I don't know I don't know what the details are I guess she arrived in La last night and somehow

(7:09) still ended up 50 minutes late so I look we can't delay the show for everybody because

() 

(7:15) someone's late so sorry we couldn't accommodate you but I mean 50 minutes late it's a little pushing it

(10:49) um okay um so announcement I was banned off of

(10:55) hinge shocker I know it's so over it's done it's done now let me tell you why I was

(11:01) banned air can you pull up the uh the band notification your account has been removed you've been banned from using

(11:07) hinge for violating our terms of service okay so let me explain it the band Hammer finally came down I was permaband

(11:14) from hinge and I was using hinge to get guests to be on the show for months so I'm

(11:20) actually surprised for nine months did they specify what they didn't specify

(11:25) they didn't specify but that was the only reason I was using hinge was to get guests for for the show uh granted that

(11:32) is a bannable offense so I'm not surprised um you know you're supposed to be on the

(11:37) dating app for dating purposes but it's kind of interesting they don't mind uh if chicks are using it to promote

(11:43) their Instagram or only fans but uh I think I'm the sole guy doing the reverse finesse

(11:49) so I'm doing what basically thousands of women are doing you know they put their Instagram and the dating profiles and I

(11:54) get banned um by the way oh really quick uh thing I got a full so I paid for

(12:00) their premium thing so I could just like because I think on hinge you can only send to eight messages a day so I just paid for their premium thing so I could

(12:05) just like blast blast out the invites I got a full refund on my 150 prepaid

(12:11) hinge Plus or premium whatever it's called just some quick game for any of you gentlemen who get banned from the dating apps and you're paying for the

(12:17) premium uh in the terms of service for hinge they

(12:22) say if they get if you get banned they won't refund you however um and by the way I prepaid so six

(12:28) months 150 bucks uh so you could get banned for a week after paying 150 and

(12:33) they won't refund you but if you paid via the Apple App Store and Eric if you could pull that up here so it's against the terms of service on

(12:41) the app store for an app actually here I'll pull it back for a sec it's against the terms of service on the app store for an app to deny you service you paid

(12:48) for so if you do get banned on any of these dating apps and you paid for their premium thing just saying you can get a

(12:55) little refund you know same report that to Apple they'll give you a full refund Eric pull it up really

(13:00) quick um yeah you just go to this page just type that thing into uh the top and uh

(13:06) yeah you can do it anyways I'm totally irrelevant but whatever okay go around the table current relationship status

(13:12) are you single friends with benefits talking stage situationship relationship Merit married engaged whatever and

(13:18) what's your longest relationship go ahead ooh I am currently dating slash in my [ __ ] face

(13:27) primary marriage which was 12 years wait are you divorced currently yes can

(13:32) you hold on you're currently in your what [ __ ] phase

(13:38) if that's okay for you YouTube um okay did you just did you just send

(13:44) the asterisk I sent you I sent a nuclear missile hold on we sent it again we're

() 

(13:49) so bad oh my sorry [ __ ] it went oh my holy okay

(13:54) um how long ago did you get divorced three years ago how long has your [ __ ] phase

(14:00) been um three years did your phase start before or after the

(14:05) divorce after I got divorced it's actually been really healing like after being super religious and super

(14:11) conservative and censored and control controlled when you finally get out on your own and ask yourself like what do I

(14:17) want what brings me alive what makes me feel connected and I found out it's not being monogamous it's not being married

(14:23) it's actually being open and available for amazing connections with people laughs

(14:32) that's amazing by the way it's now part of the stream I have so many questions

(14:39) wait so you said did you say proud [ __ ] phase I'm just oh yes I'm very very it's

(14:45) been healing healing's the word I I use for it what's been healing my [ __ ] phase

(14:51) so for me I've been raised in the indoctrination that my job as a woman is to please my male partner my husband and

(14:58) as a woman I was not given pleasure because that wasn't it didn't have to be reciprocal getting divorced and

(15:03) discovering my sexuality I learned my pleasure is just as important of a right and so now I get to

() 

(15:09) have that with different people find out what I like what I don't like have different experiences to find out what turns me on what turns me off and that's

(15:16) healing to know yourself and to learn yourself and to feel good with your pleasure and not limit it because of

(15:22) what someone else thinks you should do with it Nick was that presented as Christianity to you that the man just

(15:27) gets the pleasure and the woman doesn't get any pleasure I mean I think it was more experience it was more caught than taught I think they would they would say

(15:33) it's equal but in practice it was my job as a woman to support the man and

(15:39) whatever he wants and so you just learn this messaging of well what I want isn't as important though if you if I confront

(15:45) to them they say no no no no you're just as important but not impressive you don't experience that in your marriage

(15:50) it sounds like not the way I think it should have been correct I'm sorry to hear that yeah because I think an

(15:57) authentically Christian marriage the man gives his life for the woman and absolutely equal sexual pleasure is very

(16:04) important that so I'm sorry that you didn't experience that in your marriage yeah thank you

(16:10) uh and you said did you say what your longest relationship was yeah it was my marriage which was 12 years okay gotcha

(16:16) 12 years but you're currently single dating yeah dating when you say you're

(16:22) dating what do you mean you have a couple boyfriends yeah this is the first time I have non-monogamous so I'm dating

(16:28) a person but I have sexual experiences with other people as well okay so would

(16:33) you consider that person you're dating boyfriend yeah my partner your partner is it a boyfriend girlfriend yeah it's a

(16:39) guy it's a guy okay so how long have you been seeing him um a couple years oh you've been seeing him a couple years

(16:45) like a month after the divorce uh several months several months after divorce I've been divorced for three

(16:51) years okay so yeah okay and then so you say there's other guys in the

(16:58) picture mostly women oh mostly mostly women okay

(17:03) um how many women are in the picture I know um as many as I desire it really depends

(17:09) like it depends on the um who I feel connected to um where I'm at

(17:14) um I go sometimes to different locations specifically for an experience so it's just

(17:19) more flowy than I'm dating a guy and a girl it's more like what kind of

(17:24) experience do I want to have and are there any other guys right now no not right now okay

() 

(17:30) when you uh got married to your ex-husband how long into the marriage did you

(17:35) realize you weren't going to be pleased in the way that you wanted to oh I think I knew even before we were

(17:42) married so we had sex before marriage and I had so much guilt around it because you know that was taught that's a sin and it wasn't good but because I

(17:48) was sinning I can't complain right and so then you get married and you think it's going to get better but then really

(17:53) that taste of what I had before marriage was the substance but at that point

(17:59) you're married and I would advocate for myself and say I'm not getting as much pleasure can we focus on me and there

(18:06) was some effort but in the end it wasn't reciprocated we for me we were not

(18:11) sexually compatible and I think that's part of why my [ __ ] phase has been so healing is I will never marry someone

(18:16) without having sex with them first because if we are not sexually compatible I am not signing up to being

(18:21) your partner for life I we need to I need to know for a good fit if we're a good match if the pleasure is beneficial

(18:27) Mutual then I'm open to considering long term with you are you looking at getting

(18:33) married again not right now it's Tuesday maybe maybe down the line maybe someday

(18:39) so when you say a [ __ ] phase what do we when are we talking here

(18:45) so for me guess what that it's me reclaiming that word usually it's used as an insult for a woman who is sexually empowered it's used to like make a woman

(18:52) think like she's too loose and has no morals and values um so it just means I have sex with who

(18:57) I want when I want and I don't have to limit it based on society's expectations

(19:03) religions rules it's based on my desire and what's right for me

(19:08) okay so do you you object it sounds like you object to this term [ __ ]

(19:14) no I love it I love it when like we can reclaim it when someone tries to use it against me like that's when it's like

(19:20) when people try to insult you with words I think part of the power is when you take it back and make it yours so I've

(19:25) reclaimed it so you can call me a [ __ ] I'm like thank you I am um but that's just for me okay

(19:32) um we'll come back to some of that stuff later we'll have we'll give everyone the opportunity here to uh share Uh current

(19:37) relationship status in your longest relationship um I relationship for

(19:45) okay okay um go ahead

(19:50) um I'm single and my longest relationship has been one year oh sorry one question for you your name's Kirsten

(19:57) correct yeah um so you said your current boyfriend is that your CR you said you've been dating

(20:04) your current boyfriend for two years okay um because you wrote a note here I think

(20:10) at some point that um your first encounter with a boyfriend you were dating

(20:16) you had a unique encounter where no first time ever there was

(20:22) a pegging incident yeah so when I was like 16 this is my very first boyfriend going

(20:30) without this massive strap-on and asked me to pick him no way horrible yeah what

(20:37) was your response I just looked at him in disbelief like I barely even knew what sex was at this point and he hands

(20:43) me literally another dick and he's like can you shove it in me and I'm like what did you just say to me how big was it it

(20:51) was probably a good eight or nine inches like it was pretty [ __ ] massive

(20:56) so then what happened oh I didn't do it I left I walked right out of his basement it

(21:03) was in a basement too okay mom's basement yes it was at his parents house and we broke up after that one this

(21:09) guy's a [ __ ] not surprising dude asking virgins to peg him in his mom's basement like yeah well the [ __ ]

(21:15) chance to be the greatest troll of all time that was crazy don't get me wrong I don't but like it was my first time you're

(21:22) just gonna whip that [ __ ] out on me just caught me off guard a little bit wait so you broke up with him I did yeah wait

(21:27) but okay you see you said it was your boyfriend um boyfriend kind of talking it was like

(21:33) one of those awkward High School relationships how long have you been talking a couple months maybe how old

(21:38) was he he was 18. how many other how many other girls had he busted out that piece on I

(21:46) don't know do you know because we went to the same high school together yeah she's heard that story a few

(21:52) feet the first girl that I've heard he's tried that on so the question is what kind of pornography

(21:58) is that guy watching I think that that's okay right I'm sure I'm sure there's a category just for him somewhere

(22:04) somewhere pretty messed up Justin what do you

(22:10) think about that I think this show doesn't even need me

(22:16) I think he's doing just fine bro just like how he didn't need Kirsten no comment no comment

(22:22) um yeah that's uh he could have at least saved it for like the third time you know like to be a gentleman like at

(22:29) least wait a little wait how how long how long had you guys been talking three years a couple of months yeah it wasn't

(22:34) long at all that's such a bold move that's it was crazy wow

(22:41) okay all right uh Giselle sorry what you said you

(22:47) currently single and your longest relationship was a year correct yeah okay what about you

(22:53) in a relationship and my longest relationship was into the mic into the mic

(22:59) I'm in a relationship and my longest relationship was about two years or so

(23:04) okay I am single thank you for the reminder

(23:10) I've been single for two and a half years um I honestly prefer it that way

(23:17) um but my longest relationship was five years um this like the guy that I dated for

(23:24) five years I was with him from before I started uh high school and then until

() 

(23:30) after um it was very on and off a lot of people in our high school called me a ping pong ball because I would go

(23:37) between him and his best friend is that like your nickname oh I had a lot of nicknames well what were some of your

(23:44) other nicknames I just didn't do that one actually what were her nicknames the the biggest one

(23:50) that I remember was what was it like the hobble Goblin oh hobgoblin yes yes that

(23:56) was a real one that's a real one I'm surprised she remembers that why where did that come from so my my ex-boyfriend

(24:02) and his best friend and the other ones they used to call themselves goons and

(24:08) so because I was a girl in their group I was a hobgoblin I don't know I couldn't

(24:14) tell you I was in the middle of nowhere surrounded by you know cornfields and

(24:19) dumbasses so I don't know goon in the Hobgoblin yeah no they actually called their mom s why it was

(24:25) that one of their moms and so they always

(24:32) said that I mommed them so they also called me the same thing that they called their mom what's your current nickname

(24:37) l yeah wait so you said you were going back and forth between your sort of

(24:43) boyfriend and some other dude so I dated

(24:49) um the god the the main guy that was for five years um on and off and he usually would date

(24:56) one of my friends so to rebel and do the same thing

(25:01) I never said it was mature I was literally like 15 to okay 17 but okay just being honest but um yeah no I'm I'm

(25:09) openly pansexual now so what does that mean yeah super attracted to kitchenware

(25:16) I'm just kidding uh it just means that I am like

(25:21) it just means that I'm like open to anything I'm not I'm more attracted to

(25:28) intelligence um than and like who a person is the conversation I have with them their

(25:33) energies so like that basically includes like more than just men and women it also

(25:40) includes non-binary trans any any category of that sort I'm

(25:45) pansexual as well so a pansexual means that you date just anything based off just the vibe so like

(25:54) it could be boy girl trans okay cool how is that different how is that different than bisexual

(26:03) drag for this but like but like you like men you like women but

(26:09) being pansexual means that you don't care about gender or any of that you're

(26:14) just into somebody for who they are despite that I've dated non-binary people many times so

(26:21) and people that are in transitioning whatever the West Has Fallen oh

(26:28) um okay so and you said you're you said you've been single for two how

(26:34) long 2.5 years like over two years yeah okay all right last person I dated was a

(26:39) female was a female okay what about you um like am I in a relationship right now

(26:47) current relationship status longest relationship okay so I am single my longest relationship I've only ever had

(26:54) one boyfriend my whole life and we did it when I was 18 and until we did first

(27:01) six months and then like broke up for like two and then we dated for three months so nine months total and you said

(27:07) there was a two-month break in between yeah so were you seeing other people during that break no was he

(27:14) um no I was his second like girl ever had sex with so okay yeah okay so he

(27:20) didn't see anyone and then like we got back together because like he begged me and I gave him another he begged you

(27:53) how long did it last forever well so he was like okay he was kind of like like I

(27:59) um closer to myself okay I was like I was young you know so I thought I was

(28:06) like in love and like he was like kind of a bum like because he was like he got kicked out of his parents house and he

(28:13) was living in the back of his truck um and in his camper and so I was trying

(28:19) to help him and like be like Captain Save A Hoe but like for a guy so I let

(28:24) him like live at my house with me and then like I was just like okay you gotta go because he would like get fired from

(28:31) like every union job he had because he would show up to like set like late like

(28:36) you have to be there at 6 30 in the union that's like the most important thing is like show up on time and like

(28:42) he was always late so I was just like you're kind of a bum so like we're over sorry

(28:48) smart move yeah yeah don't don't marry a bum yeah it's good advice don't do it okay uh

(28:57) what about you the questions uh relationship yeah kind of relationship status married and the

(29:03) longest relationship is my marriage okay almost five years very cool okay yeah I'm currently single longest

(29:09) relationship is like a year and a half I always keep that a mystery seven years

(29:15) all right mystery seven sixty girls that Justin's talking to now

(29:22) don't have a clue you keep whether you're married I'm kidding I'm kidding do you um do you have can you at least

(29:30) confirm if you have like one girl or do you kind of date multiple people cannot confirm can I wish I could and I wish I

() 

(29:37) could that means it might be multiples of something um is there how about this confirm or

(29:42) deny is there a harem cannot confirm or deny

(29:48) can you confirm or deny if you're voluntarily celibate what the [ __ ] I can't do that yeah I'm definitely not

(29:55) voluntarily Justin hello he literally has a welcome mat right under his nose

(30:03) says the Hobgoblin sucking dick sucking dicks in cornfields

(30:08) roasted yeah okay I can take it smoke okay

(30:14) all right cool um so uh let's see here I have a question yeah Justin do you ever see

(30:20) yourself getting married no not on paper no absolutely not I believe in love and marriage and in

(30:25) regards to taking care of a woman fully and your responsibilities as a father and a provider and protector 100 in fact

(30:31) I think that's probably what's broken about the world but in regards to letting the state get into all my businesses that took me over a decade to

(30:37) build absolutely not know how do you think you're gonna get to the place of that marriage you want with that family

(30:45) and that Lifelong Love I didn't say I didn't have family or children I just said I'm in your business oh I see okay

(30:53) so you want to keep it private is what you're saying that's what I said do you Justin I might have multiple

(30:59) family you never know I might like family more than you so much I have five do you think that's a good thing to have

(31:04) multiple families I think it's good if there's one dad and there's not a bunch of step parents involved and the dad can be the hero and those five families live

(31:11) a 10x better life than they would have otherwise yes ma'am I do but you don't think that it will be ultimately a an

(31:18) opportunity for jealousy or disharmony amongst women are always going to be jealous what's changed about that women

(31:23) been jealous all the way through time so I'm not jealous in my marriage I don't care about your marriage I'm talking about mine well my life is going to be

(31:30) so I don't answer to you so that's my answer I'm gonna run my my situation exactly how I want to and generally when

(31:37) I do that that's when I have the most happiness let's say in my life so so

(31:43) and you would want that for your daughters yeah yeah I live my life unapologetically on

(31:50) my terms so if my daughters that are overly spoiled and and educated in every way and have friends all over the world

(31:56) and World traveled in the best schools in the world if they have a problem with me at the end of the day then they can kick rocks too I I'm not going to simp

(32:02) for my daughters I'll love them fully but if they grow up and turn into a person that doesn't want to get in line

(32:07) with me or at least look here's my goal as a parent teach my children how the world Works give them the skills so they

(32:14) can live on their own terms and give them choice if they choose not to make me part of their life after I've given them those things I've still succeeded

(32:19) as a father but I guess I'm asking if you're comfortable answering obviously but are you wanting to be a role model

(32:24) for your kids is that part of a thousand percent a father should show up in every way for his children I think I'll be better than most fathers regardless of

(32:30) how many children I have I might have a hundred but you think part of being a role model it's okay for your kids not

(32:35) to know even their your relationship status with their own mom they will know the relationship status with me and their mother but you have

(32:41) other relationships with other women what does that have to do with anything wait I'm just wondering if you think I haven't even said that I'm just saying

(32:47) like if I want to I will but you don't think that's a problem for your daughter to know that about their dad that that

(32:53) he has multiple Mysteries that's up to my daughter man you know but do you want your daughter

(32:58) to have a guy like that long term if he takes care of her in every way and she has a much better life because of it yeah I'm cool with that wait do you want

(33:05) to have 100 kids sound like I might have a bunch of kids yeah I believe in having kids man so there's there's too many

(33:12) dumb ass people having kids might as well have a smart person have some dude it's Justin Loki about to repopulate the

(33:17) world kids are awesome single-handedly reverse the declining

(33:23) they got all these single women out here talking [ __ ] about [ __ ] man well cool I'll have babies with you what's up now

(33:29) part of it is being a smart ass right now right to be honest but I look if

(33:35) if a god decides to have a bunch of children I mean you see it happen all the time God gets married he's a shitty

(33:41) father shitty husband ends up getting a divorce and then goes have and has babies with the next chick doing the

(33:46) same thing I'm doing this up I'm not a lion coward about it I hear you I I see that this is what it is but I think the

(33:51) big question is I mean it seems like you're really focused on self-improvement which is awesome and so I guess my question would be is it ID

(33:57) like what are we striving towards individually right and what do we think is best for society and I think kids

(34:03) want to know their parents love each other and are committed till death do they part to each other yep didn't say

(34:09) any of that wasn't true but if you're the one saying that's not true okay but do you think it would be a little bit

(34:14) um confusing for one of your kids if they found out let's say Theory no because if they trust me enough to come to me I'll just tell them the truth what

(34:20) are we talking about I'm not hiding from anything I just told you I understand that it seems like you're challenging because you have a problem with it I

(34:25) simply don't care so your your kids are saying you don't care if they find out you have multiple

(34:30) Mistresses if I had multiple women and then my kids came to me then I would just talk to them like a

(34:37) like an adult if they're adult enough to ask I'm adult enough to tell them well whatever they ask I'm there for

(34:44) you that's it find somebody else I don't feel bad I'm gonna live in truth here's the

(34:50) difference between me and most men most men are doing this [ __ ] behind people's back right like a [ __ ] coward and

(34:55) they're not even giving the family the life that they deserve so if I choose to do that in the future which I have not said I'm going to do

(35:02) then so be it but if I don't I don't hear ya I guess that you're saying you

(35:08) don't want to share your relationship status but then you just said you people hiding it and be so I guess I think there's a difference

(35:15) between not wanting to share one's relationship status publicly on a platform like this versus when I have a

(35:20) big internet following and like offices that you can Google and all kinds of things like that I don't want

(35:26) to I don't want that smoke for people in my life I see yeah that makes sense uh just just one thing related to the well

(35:31) not related to this uh is the audio okay guys because sometimes we have issues with uh the number two and I just uh want to

(35:39) make sure can you guys hear Justin okay one in the chat if you can hear Justin okay guys I want to make sure that you

(35:44) guys hear him all right one in the chat if Justin's coming through okay looks like a lot of ones audio is good

(35:50) okay perfect thank you guys um I have a question on this Justin so yeah um I know you can neither conf

(35:57) confirm nor deny the current situations but let's it sounds like perhaps there have

(36:03) been times where you're seeing multiple women so

(36:08) what is the pitch to a girl that you won't be loyal is it is it overtly

(36:15) communicated is it just an understanding like what what's the what's the cell what's the pitch to a girl basically

(36:21) because you say you're open with it with the girls how do you pitch it I mean first of all generally they kind of know

(36:27) up front you know if they slide in my Instagram DMS and they see my life it's like they're like are you really that

(36:32) surprised and so there's questions you could ask to to see if a girl's bi or not I might joke around ask her blondes

(36:38) brunettes early on sure you know what I'm saying and see what she says just to check if she see if she's bi or not and

(36:44) and look I don't coach game I'm just like super honest and then another thing is by the time a girl really sees me

(36:49) online she's already listened to my content and listen to things I've said so they already I mean they would know

(36:55) the truth you know right um I'm probably gonna ratchet back you know some of these dating type shows just because I

(37:01) feel like I've had the same conversation a million times and just do more of the business stuff but um by and largely my content as a filter

(37:08) you know and and I get I get DMS from women all day you know just basically

(37:14) saying hey I at least appreciate you telling the truth I got cheated on got lied to et cetera et cetera et cetera so

(37:20) um there's not much screening I really have to do okay you know I mean but have there been

(37:26) any instances I assume perhaps maybe some of the women you approached or they weren't familiar with you I mean what

(37:32) because you say you're open with the girls and yeah and uh you know let's say to all the G's out there that they're

(37:37) trying to level up and they kind of want to you know they want to have well you know what I would say first I would say

(37:43) first that having multiple women is not the goal I don't think that's a good goal for a young man you know I think working on yourself completely and

(37:49) absorbing and having a lot of women come to you as a goal um for example like let's say that

(37:54) you're married and you have a loving relationship I don't think there's anything in the world wrong with that at all but I want that for you and

(38:00) everything well too bad that's not what I want so that's my business not yours but what I'm saying is is that if I'm in a situation with a

(38:07) woman and she thinks she wants to leave because I have let's say more girls okay cool you can leave me for a man that you love less that will cheat on you anyway

(38:14) if he could I'm not doing anything any other man would not do if he could maybe her husband couldn't doesn't but you

(38:20) know for the sake of the conversation I think most men if they could would have the option of having multiple women now

(38:26) it has also been my experience that I can only love one person at a time and so that said there there's you know

(38:33) I think there's only one spot in my heart as far as you know long-term commitment and when I look at long-term

(38:39) commitment I look at protecting providing being there fully emotionally a person's best friend I mean ride or

(38:44) die like really there with them even if they're upset or jealous can I ask you one more question far away okay if you

(38:52) have replaced in only one place in your heart for one woman or you want to have one woman in your heart I think you said why don't you just commit to one and

(38:59) choose to be faithful to her I'm just not wired that way I spent my whole 20s trying to fix myself

(39:05) control you you work out you do business you can possess your own your own power

(39:11) and just direct it but that's not how I am that's not how I am do you think that might be a limited mindset

(39:17) I think it's none of your business but I don't want you to think I'm triggered by you I'm not I saw somebody say that and

(39:22) I think that's interesting I think you're annoying but I'm not sure you know what I'm saying no you are you're annoying in like this goody two shoes

(39:29) type way and that's fine uh I'm gonna live my life on my terms Unapologetic unapologetically like truly so uh you

(39:37) can ask me this 85 different ways at the end of the day I'm gonna walk out of here the same man and any woman in my life that you either

(39:44) accept that or leave and that's not a threat that's hey this is what I offer if that works for you okay if it doesn't

(39:50) you can go there's plenty of people that are in hot wife relationships they're swingers they're gay none of those

(39:56) people get questioned the way I do yeah none of those people could question the way I do I'm one of very few men that

(40:02) can actually come out inside and on my on the top of my head there's probably a handful the Tate Brothers being some of

(40:07) them and then a couple of my other friends that can actually openly say this how I'm going to live I'm gonna live on my terms and guess what women

(40:13) don't leave us for it I cannot think of a woman that has left me over telling them that yeah some women like that yeah some of them are like oh my God that's

(40:19) so sexy so no woman wants a man that other women don't want and by and

(40:24) largely I think that women are attracted to it that little bit of dread in them that little bit of competition and I don't mind providing that atmosphere for

(40:30) them at all and I'm not sorry I kind of have a question so um I hate that I talk about this so much

(40:37) actually it's not that because yeah it's just

(40:42) like I'm not trying to promote it no no I'm saying like if a young man thinks he wants to get married I don't want him to

(40:47) see me and think oh I need to start I need to sit my wife down and tell her if he doesn't actually feel that way but I

(40:52) think you'd be shocked at how many men hate themselves over the fact that they want multiple women and they're scared

(40:58) that everybody's going to reject them and they're going to get kicked out of their family group their church group their friends and same with women same

(41:04) with women yeah exactly I was just about to say that you know it's the same sense of um of you know especially even from

(41:10) the opposite perspective from mine as as even somebody that's only 21 years old I've experienced you know like some a

(41:16) man sometimes wants to be very um protective is a good way of putting it

(41:22) and and I understand that um fully um and there are certain times where

(41:29) it's like it's hard not to be like the jealous type and I've been in polyamorous relationship well let me be

(41:34) clear I'm not polyamorous no yeah that's why I was actually that's my question there are some girls I'm seeing and I

(41:40) don't care as much they like and they like I'm not watching them like yeah I'm like whatever but any anyone that's

(41:46) close to that I'm trying to provide for or possibly have children with and always shut down now you can help me bring women home all day long I'm not

(41:53) trying to leave you out but at the same time like I'm not you're not talking to any other men and and those women are

(41:59) happy with that so it is like a it is like what I described kind of like where it's what's mine is mine but yeah what's

(42:05) yours is also mine well I wouldn't I wouldn't say what yours also mine I never thought of it that way but yeah so

(42:11) you're going to be protective over your girl like if you really care about her you really really care about her like especially like if you're with a guy and

(42:17) let's say he takes you to a swingers club he probably doesn't love you he's just trying to get a trade-off right I don't know about that because you can't

(42:24) I can't go both ways it may be so maybe so for you I'm just saying any woman I truly care about like I'm not I'm not

(42:30) playing that [ __ ] at all yeah well in that sense though like do you think it's fair no I don't think life is fair at

(42:36) all and this particular subject is super unfair I want to be very very clear about that number one I am not promoting

(42:41) it I'm not promoting it in any way not promoting what I'm not promoting that men have a bunch of women okay yeah like

(42:46) I'm saying that for me in my life the the biggest struggle in my adult life was filling out of place because of

(42:53) how I felt about it was almost like hey I'm coming out the closet I'm super straight you know um and then number and then number two

(43:00) I'm not promoting what what I'm saying right now is fair at all I don't think it's fair at all I don't think the World's Fair yeah but it and I I might

(43:06) be misunderstanding you but it sounds like you're saying that some men maybe maybe yourself don't have

(43:12) the ability to be monogamous and so you're choosing to frame it that way I'm telling you how would you like how I

(43:18) want to how would you I would frame it as it was more of me holding my breath and trying to be something I wasn't

(43:32) and you're praying God God please let me not leave this girl I love because I want to sleep with the volleyball team

(43:37) type stuff like the biggest heartbreak in my life was in college I broke up with Miss Louisiana while she's getting

(43:42) ready for Miss America because not because we didn't get along not because the sex wasn't good not because we weren't like best friends

(43:48) it's because I wanted to sleep with other girls at school yeah and I thought I was doing the right thing and I ended

(43:54) up breaking my own heart you know what I'm saying and so through my 20s I would I thought something was wrong with me

(43:59) and I was trying to fix it trying to fix it trying to fix it and in time I realized that there was never anything wrong with me at all I

(44:06) just had to live my truth and find people even if it's just a small group of billions of people in the world maybe

(44:11) it's three to five people that love me for who I am and then I'm at peace because then I don't have to be wrong they don't have to answer to my

(44:17) conscience I can just be myself and for that reason I'm able to put walls down like oh she might catch me and just tell

(44:24) the truth and so instead of loving her 80 90 I can love her 120 and take care of her every way so you can give your

(44:30) whole heart to somebody when you're not living in lives 100 and that was interesting for me because I was in a monogamous marriage because I was told

(44:35) that was the only way the right way and then I learned over the years that I'm actually non-monogamous and that was even interesting when I started dating

(44:41) after I got divorced being upfront about it because I know and I said the same thing where people are mad at me because I do in public what they do in secret

(44:47) instead of like instead of hiding I tell people like hey I'm non-monogamous I can't be only with one person for the

(44:53) rest of my life and if you're not cool with that then we're not meant to date but if you are cool or you're meant to be in a different position like you for

(45:00) example over there with your titties out and everything talking about you [ __ ] like yeah Mama when I hear a girl say that I'm like okay well [ __ ] I I take

(45:06) a ride on that you know Ferris wheel but it you get put out of the wife bucket

(45:12) for a guy like me but at the same time like I'm not mad at you for saying it

(45:17) because a bunch of people were calling you Haram and stuff like that and and technically maybe it's true but

(45:23) it just for me when I see a girl like that it just it just puts her in a different bucket yeah and I'm happy to be in whatever pocket because it's like

(45:29) I know what I want and if I'm not wife material for you I don't want to be your wife so it's like to me it's alignment

(45:34) and that's not an issue and you can call me whatever no I'm not here to judge you about it you're at peace I'm at peace and I think that's the biggest thing I

(45:40) learned walking away from the church and religion is how unique every person is and it's everyone has their own set of

(45:47) morals and values that works for them and I used to think there was right or wrong but now it's like if you're at peace with you that's the most important

(45:53) thing if I'm at peace with me that's the most important thing and I've never been more peace in my life so I love those

(46:00) with kindness like despite your disagreements that's why we're in an America in the first place like you're

(46:05) allowed to disagree with other people and their opinion America so I wanna I wanna pipe up here

(46:11) I find your uh your perspective interesting Justin I used to want the same thing

(46:17) when I was about 18 years old I I realized I was like man I want to have like 30 kids with like 10 different

(46:23) women like I just I wanted a ball out have as many kids as humanly possible and this was when I uh I was not walking

(46:30) with the Lord at this point in time and I maintain that dream till about my mid-20s

(46:35) and I realized after some conversations with some friends that were from like

(46:41) Mormon polygamy Cults out in Utah you know my buddy he was in uh his

(46:46) grandfather had like I don't know like 20 wives or something like that and he had like hundreds of grandchildren with all these different women

(46:52) and I asked him about it he was always turned off to religion because of his experience growing up in this family

(46:58) I asked him why and he said the rates of alcoholism suicide all of these

(47:03) different things in his extended family were extremely high a bunch of his cousins had committed suicide they

(47:09) suffered from severe depression all of these different things and it was because of how big and difficult to

(47:15) manage that extended family was that came from their grandfather and he looked at that and he just hated it

(47:21) right and that that really like that really hit home for me

(47:26) and a few years later you know I was reading through the Old Testaments of the Bible and one of the things that you

() 

(47:31) notice about all the Patriarchs in the Old Testament right King David King Solomon many of the

(47:38) different Patriarchs they would have multiple children with multiple wives and what would happen is their kids

(47:44) would end up warring with one another and they would end up at odds with one another and so you would have this

(47:50) pattern of broken families from men who had practiced polygamy now if that's your choice for your life

(47:55) I want to be really clear I'm not defining what I'm going to do like I'm not saying I'm going to have multiple

(48:02) wise with multiple women's I'm just keeping it very vague yes yes understood understood and the point that I'm making

(48:08) is I I just wanted to share I personally used to want what you've been describing and I wanted

(48:14) to make a ton of money to be able to support it but I came to the point in my life where I realized you know as a Christian I'm a Christian

(48:21) the thing that I can do to honor God personally is align myself with his prescription for marriage between one

(48:27) woman and one man I understand that's not your choice but I think part of the wisdom in embracing that and in

(48:33) embracing monogamy is you create a very healthy family long term right and like

(48:39) I get a bro I get the desire to want to be with multiple women it's it's in our freaking DNA but for me personally

(48:46) that's something I am absolutely willing to sacrifice because it produces more

(48:51) fruit in a family long term I know families and monogamous relation marriages that's toxic I know families

(48:58) that are in polyamorous and non-monogamous relationships that are healthy and vice versa so I think it's

(49:03) less about the structure is what determines the health it's the health of the individuals in that relationship you

(49:09) can have a monogamous marriage and if the couples are miserable that's going to affect their children you can have

(49:14) couples or thrupples or quads or whatever who aren't they're polyamorous relationship and they're healthy and they're connected and they're

(49:19) communicate they communicate there's boundaries and that's going to provide more health so I just push back on this idea that there's a prescription that

(49:26) for All Humans this is what you should do when every human is so different and like it's a matter it's a matter of the

(49:32) health of the individual and then who they're being with then the structure that makes it healthy but if you're sleeping with multiple people what is

(49:39) the point of saying I'm in a relationship with this person like if you're gonna say I'm committing to you what is the point of being in a

(49:45) relationship with them yeah it's a great question so I think it's different for every person so for me since I'm pansexual and I'm non-monogamous I can

(49:52) have someone I deeply deeply love and I still want and desire other experiences and before I was before when I thought I

(49:59) was monogamous I didn't understand it I thought this I thought the same thing like oh then it's a free-for-all and there's no boundaries and there's no

() 

(50:05) priority but for me it's like oh once I find someone I feel so committed to I

(50:10) don't like that's set that's good and then I have these other experiences that actually nurture that so I sold if I had

(50:16) outside sexual activities once I'm in a marriage or in a partnership it would tear apart the relationship based on how

(50:21) I'm wired when I have outside sexual activities with other people it actually makes me fall more in love with my

(50:27) person no one told me that and I thought I was crazy but that's how I'm wired it

(50:33) like brings something alive and it makes me want to gush love on my person and it's the exact opposite of it so is

(50:39) your dude cool with sharing you with other dudes uh we do women right now so

(50:45) not it wouldn't be with other men just women not yet and why is that um so the way we do it is we like we

(50:51) want to be very intentional about how we do because the most important relationship that matters is us so it's

(50:57) not a free-for-all so for the first part it was just us we built our foundation we put our Roots down and then we

(51:02) reached the point where like let's start having other experiences and we would just do one and then we'd reflect on it

(51:08) talk communicate was any boundary across how do we feel and we found that it actually brought us closer together wait

(51:14) do you guys have threesomes oh so the threesomes with the other woman so you

(51:19) and another girl and then him brought you guys closer together yes and even my

(51:24) own so because I'm on only fans I make content with girls so I have sex with girls for my work oh you do only fans and that also brings us closer together

(51:31) I had these amazing experiences and I come home and I tell all about the things and like I feel alive and

(51:36) energized and and did you say you were a mother yes and okay I have to yeah do

(51:42) you how old are your kids 7 10 12. and does it because I went to school with or

(51:50) there was a guy uh like his mom drove a pink Hummer and she was a porn star right and everybody dogged on him

(51:56) because you know and like it sucked for him and I felt really bad do you think

(52:02) that your kids would be affected at some point with like the fact that you did

(52:07) only fans no so I so my kids are very educated at their age-appropriate level but I've asked my teen boys how they

(52:13) feel and I was like do you ever get picked on by your friends and they said no why would we even have friends like

(52:18) that so their friends don't even know they know they know they do know and they don't care what about other kids at

(52:24) school these are the kids at school that know well I mean like your kids have friends and then there's other kids that

(52:29) they're not friends with um I think I mean my little kids but they I don't think their friends know but as they get older their friends know

(52:36) because I'm friends with their moms or their dads or their families and so it becomes knowledge and they just like cool and then some of my kids are like

(52:42) here's how you can make more money you should try this on Twitch you should do this like they actually like help me and

(52:47) they well Jen's ears yeah like they're just so open-minded they don't have the stigma and the Judgment that I was

(52:53) raised with yeah I have a question yeah earlier in the conversation you made the statement if I recall correctly you put

(52:59) it as long as you're at peace with your morality that's what matters right do you think that this kind of sexuality

(53:05) would be sustainable if it was like all across our society like if everybody operated this way I think a lot of

(53:11) people do operate this way they just do it in secret or behind backs yep on accident and or on accident versus what

(53:16) do you think the percentage is like more than 10 percent less than 10 the people over 50. oh yeah the people you think

(53:23) it's well over 50 well over 58 of people that do what that would rather cheat on

(53:29) their spouse than be openly polyamorous with them and open the lines of communication and calling cap on that I

(53:35) don't think that was actually a study done where 70 of men have cheat on their wives at one point or another yeah but I

(53:40) think 70 of would drag a number I think a big thing a big reason I think

(53:46) it's been at least I think it's way higher than the generation that I am in your generation maybe for sure

(53:54) but also also like your your Social Circle like a lot of my friends like most of my friends they're not

(54:00) interested in doing that so this one I can understand this was in part by Design design because the sexual Revolution happened right in the 60s and

(54:06) the 70s and there was a sexologist named Alfred Kinsey I don't know if anyone has heard of him but he was he's kind of

(54:12) known as The Godfather or the grandfather of sexology today and so his ideology has really influenced a lot of

(54:18) sex ed today and a lot of behavior today and so what he did he wanted to prove that everybody was sexually deviant was

(54:25) the term at the time sexually deviant they weren't a monogamous relationships or if they were they'd lie and they were in swinger culture and other kinds of

(54:31) relationships and he wanted to mainstream this idea because he wanted to break down the natural family single

(54:37) mother single father together married together and with with children and so what he ended up doing is he created

(54:43) social data research data and he would actually survey prison populations for

(54:49) their sexual experiences and he would use that and claim that this was representative of the entire population

(54:56) so actually he would say he would ask you know interview convicts or have people interview convicts and who were

(55:01) involved in all kinds of dark stuff and they would share yeah we've been obviously in bestiality rape or we've

(55:07) been involved in having many different partners and then he said this is representative of so 70 or 80 of

(55:13) Americans he claimed are involved in swinger culture or polyamory behind closed doors but he was lying is the

(55:20) thing but so you're telling me that stat she just referenced is totally I don't know exactly where you got that set but

(55:25) I think it might be a Kinsey and Stat because a lot of his statistics kind of created the Groundswell for that

(55:31) mentality and then the problem is you can become a self-fulfilling prophecy right so if everybody thinks oh it's

(55:37) normal to have sex with a ton of different people it's normal to not be monogamous it's actually good to not be

(55:42) monogamous right that's the message a society tells you it's good to you know porn is good sleeping around is good sex

(55:48) is not a big deal then it kind of becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy because more and more people get sexualized and get you know start down

(55:55) that path and unfortunately in our society too a lot of young girls I mean I heard what you shared Kirsten right it

() 

(56:01) was horrible like with that guy I mean it's ridiculous right but he was probably watching porn right so he's

(56:06) being trained by his pornography to treat you like an object I mean he didn't even talk to you about he just

(56:11) did this gross thing to you and you're like what the heck you walk out right but he was trained by porn to do that

(56:17) that's not normal like a little boy doesn't grow up and become that naturally as a man he's trained to think

(56:22) and become deviant and messed up I disagree because if you're gay you're

(56:27) gonna want it in the ass and as a woman I love pegging and I didn't learn that from porn it's a desire I had it's like

(56:34) I wish I had a dick sometimes and if I don't I'm gonna buy one so to say that that's like like to say it only comes

(56:41) from porn is like such a when did you first when did you first realize you wish you had a dick sometimes

(56:51) and have always wanted to [ __ ] most people with two legs like I just like am drawn to having sex and in my 20s

(56:59) maybe the late 20s I think the Curiosity was there and like I didn't watch porn in my 20s I was a Christian in a

(57:05) monogamous marriage but I had this desire and I was afraid of it and then I learned that like this is actually a common desire and like I've fulfilled it

(57:11) and I'm like oh my gosh I love this it like resonates with me and it brings me pleasure it brings my people pleasure

(57:16) that I do this too but outside of it's easy to judge I'm like ew weird gross wrong but inside it's been amazing for

(57:23) me and the people that we participate in but if you're okay if you are happy like having sex with a person you're having

(57:30) sex with right what is the difference between you having sex with that person you having sex with a different person like why do you feel the need to have

(57:36) sex with everybody it's not a need it's a desire and I think it's learning that it's okay to have desires it's okay if

(57:42) they're not mainstream it's like if it's between consenting adults like do what

(57:47) you want like that's another thing like no one's being harmed here no one's being coerced no one's being manipulated it's like I desire this do you desire

(57:53) this yes great we're all on the same here's a question do you think all desires should be acted on all sexual

(58:00) desires nope and that's that's a common accusation that's like oh well then you're gonna it bestiality is always

(58:06) thrown in there which is so ridiculous can we not talk about BCR oh yeah sorry I can't say that conversation but like they say people

(58:13) then assume it's all desired it's like no it's like checking it and asking and what I teach my life coaching is the

(58:18) difference between surface desires and Soulful desires what's the surface desire of like God would feel like

(58:24) really good right now is eating an entire package of Oreos dunking them in milk and watching TV for five hours that might feel really good right now but my

(58:30) Soulful desire is just to feel good not feel gross in about five hours so it's like checking beneath that desire and so

(58:37) for me I was always afraid of my sexual desires what does this mean about me am I a cheater am I going to hurt someone I'm like oh I'm just a very sexual

(58:44) person who gets a lot of pleasure and connection out of sex that's actually a gift I bring when I have sex with you

(58:50) it's amazing I bring my whole self to the table and I've had people tell me I've never had something like that I've

(58:57) never been given pleasure like that and to know that I could fulfill that for you that's an honor so I want to go back

(59:02) to my original question yeah if everybody had this same set of

(59:07) moralities across the table throughout our whole society how quickly do you think it would take

(59:13) for things to completely fall apart I don't think that would ever happen first of all I don't think that would ever happen no and I because I think you

(59:19) don't you don't think hold on hold on Chase one second oh yeah uh if you guys curse in these it doesn't

(59:25) trigger the robot voice uh wait let's pull it back up and read it yeah I'll pull it back up um I don't know why this one came over

(59:33) it but what the frick hold on it's I'm re-triggering it right now uh what is going on

(59:40) yo bad zxc thing for the 200 just when I thought the 100 just when I thought the

(59:47) depravity could not get any lower in modern women all I can say is you can only impress me at this point both 304

(59:55) you think your kids aren't about to get the soul bullied out of them because of your phase is completely insane uh your

(1:00:02) response yeah it's just like I've already told you my kids and my teen boys have said my our friends don't care

(1:00:08) and they know so it doesn't stand any truth to that like do you think do you

(1:00:14) think if sorry do you think if other families were practicing the same thing their kids wouldn't get bullied

(1:00:20) um I think his get bull no matter what unfortunately it doesn't right but you're not just you can give them different families that's the that's the

(1:00:27) thing is like we try to stigmatize sexually different families as though they're gonna be the ones give away I

(1:00:32) have friends who are all kinds of monogamous monogamous married single Parenthood and their kids are getting

(1:00:37) bullied for totally different reasons it's not relegated to just sexually different right but it's also being a

(1:00:43) Target on people yeah exactly people will get bullied for all for all sorts of different things but that's not an

(1:00:48) excuse to give kids more ammunition do you think that teen their teen sons

(1:00:54) are telling you the truth absolutely I know they're friends their friends know me and we talk about it all the time

(1:01:00) because like they're we just have such an open family like what if they didn't want to hurt your feelings would it weird you out if you're if your kids

(1:01:06) friends were like watching your only fans like well they can well they can't because you have to be of age

(1:01:14) I don't know how old they definitely are all over there

(1:01:21) they're definitely watching your content they're definitely doing things they shouldn't be doing to your content but who hasn't done that to their friend's

(1:01:27) hot mom there's one more important thing going on here though because I think it's

(1:01:33) something really interesting Nick you were talking about like sexual desires and the desire to act out on our

(1:01:38) different sexual desires and I think there's this mentality in our culture today that if someone has a sexual

(1:01:43) desire then that is their identity that can become their identity if they have enough of a sexual desire in One

(1:01:48) Direction that's their identity and so but I don't think that's true I don't think we're defined by our desires I

(1:01:54) think we're defined by what we choose I love pegging and I do not identify as a pegger it's like I love threesomes and I

(1:02:00) don't identify as a threesome it's like I'm Nicole Mitchell a woman who's alive and in tune with what she wants and lets

(1:02:07) herself have it with consenting adults and there's nothing wrong with that I disagree all kinds of experiences but

(1:02:13) doesn't mean I have to identify as each of those things I love Oreos I'm not an Oreo you know it's like

(1:02:18) we have to realize like this these are statements we say as it's there's no

(1:02:23) substance behind it no I disagree I disagree Nick I gotta make a point you go for it you say that there's nothing

(1:02:29) wrong with it you say that as long as you're at peace with your morality it's fine I completely disagree again I think

(1:02:37) I think if our entire Society ran the way that you're kind of prescribing where people just fulfill whatever quote-unquote Soulful desires they have

(1:02:44) things would completely fall apart like yeah the values that she was preaching to Justin earlier when he you know he

(1:02:50) was getting a little bit annoyed by it understandably I I what she was preaching like like I I am

(1:02:57) here personally in the world to serve God and I believe that one of the best ways that we can serve God Is by

(1:03:03) sacrificing our selfish desires that might have negative impacts on ourselves

(1:03:08) or other people and these statements like you know as long as you're fine with it it's okay like there's Ripple

(1:03:15) effects to our actions in that statement though the assumption is that the desires are negative and that they will create harm so I have a belief that my

(1:03:22) desires are given to me by God and by fulfilling my desires it brings more good in the world you think that they're

(1:03:28) given to you by God yes I think the fact that I have a clitoris which only exists for pleasure not for reproduction not

(1:03:34) for child wearing purely for my pleasure I believe there's a Divine Design where pleasure is our Birthright and so by me

(1:03:41) honoring my desire for pleasure letting myself receive it letting myself give it to others produces so much good and

(1:03:47) pleasure and connection I it baffles me surely how people are so afraid of pleasure they'd rather sacrifice and

(1:03:54) deny into say to push back what you're saying earlier too like if we did all the way you guys preach like husband

(1:03:59) wife monogamous marriage and kids that's how Society has been what the past 100

() 

(1:04:04) plus years and women are shocked in marriages thousands of years women were trapped in marriages they couldn't get

(1:04:09) out and if they got out they were ruined because they were their worth and value was solely found in that marriage they could only Professor yes women didn't

(1:04:16) have the right to own homes open credit cards have bank accounts buy property the reason the divorce rate is so high

(1:04:21) now is more women are so are we are capable to be financially independent so

(1:04:27) this is something I'm super passionate about because I think there's been a version of maybe fundamentalist

(1:04:32) Christianity that people have experienced that they felt really hurt by and so they've kind of lashed out

(1:04:38) against it and rejected it and I see this a lot actually um but the reality is when you know I

(1:04:45) actually so I was raised Protestant went through this kind of semi-agnostic phase kind of like you went through and then I ended up Catholic after doing a ton of

(1:04:51) study and a ton of research and just being convinced by the beauty of it and it was learning about how men and women

(1:04:57) are equal dignity they're equal Partners learning about sex what God's design is

(1:05:04) which is a beautiful one that it is about pleasure it absolutely is about pleasure and pleasure it's not dirty or

(1:05:09) shameful but it's also about procreation and the ability to bring life into the world and it's designed to be within

(1:05:14) marriage where you're in a lifelong public commitment to someone that you're

(1:05:20) going to give yourself a hundred and ten percent to and that's how you build a beautiful family of love and respect and

(1:05:26) your children are secure in your love that you have with your spouse and so you know I don't know all of your experiences obviously and everyone has

(1:05:31) had different experiences but the reality is the social data proves that

(1:05:37) monogamous lifelong marriages make people happiest they have the most sex and the best sex and kids are healthier

(1:05:44) that way and so that's why I know you're excited about that Vision uh Chase and that's why we want to share that Vision

(1:05:49) not just because of some fundamentalist thing but because it actually makes people happier and healthier in the long run yeah okay well to my people then

() 

(1:05:56) we'll continue on that conversation a little bit later um I do have to read a couple super chats and I need to touch

(1:06:03) on a couple other points here so we have uh let's see here we have did I miss a few [ __ ] okay I don't think so all right

(1:06:09) we have a German ganzer 100 are you able to see this can you read this

(1:06:14) to lean forward top males are often referred to as Alpha but the term Alpha comes from studies of wolves in

(1:06:20) captivity not on the wild where they are more family centered guys if you could replace alphas and betas what would you

(1:06:26) call these top guys Justin wallers and

(1:06:33) first of all I think Alpha and beta is the most cringy thing to say cringe to to associate yourself with

(1:06:40) um so I don't I don't particularly identify as either hard for me to say

(1:06:47) was that a question directed towards us it's asking the guys I guess I mean I yeah I think the whole Alpha Beta things

(1:06:53) kind of cringe especially if you call it like yourself refer you know there's no

(1:06:58) planet where I would ever call myself that I just I hate it so much you got Alpha you got you got sigmas that March

(1:07:06) to the beat of Their Own Drum I feel like sigmas think they could be Alpha but there's a real Alpha around so they're like I'm Sigma [ __ ] that dude

() 

(1:07:13) that's just as nerdy you got betas and then this is one I'm trying to bring into the Lexicon bro the Omega males oh

(1:07:20) yeah yeah what's that what is that what's the Omega male right this is this is uh you've got Christ who said he was

(1:07:26) the Alpha and the Omega right and so you've got alpha males the Omega male this is the archetype of the man who commands respect He commands

(1:07:32) Authority but he also has his sights set on the end the kingdom that's coming right an alpha male who's focused on the

(1:07:38) kingdom he's focused on the service right and yeah he's a he's a leader to serve yes that's the Omega male I

(1:07:44) identify as an Omega male Chase is an Omega male okay very cool very

(1:07:50) cool all right uh Mr Max thanks for the hundred uh Chase and Leela can we bring back moral how can we bring back morals

(1:07:57) in society you just gotta live it Joy like proud

(1:08:04) live in it here's yeah and don't judge people you know ultimately stay the

(1:08:09) course of what you think's right a good answer I would also feel like I've got a better one no no no to add to

(1:08:16) add on to that how to bring back morals in society I mean there's there's nothing new Under the Sun right the morality that she's preaching has been

(1:08:21) around for thousands of years various societies have experimented with polygamy pansexuality so on and so forth

(1:08:27) I think the best way to bring back morality in society is to be fruitful right God provided us the

(1:08:35) blueprint for success in relationships and marriage all these different kind of things and like I don't think a society

(1:08:40) that's based on that kind of morality is going to stand the test of time right but I think if if people try to be the

(1:08:46) best versions of themselves that they can possibly be raise the best families that they possibly can raise up those families with good morality and and that

(1:08:54) dynasty that lineage goes on to set the Legacy in society I think long term that's how you bring morality back rock

(1:09:01) and roll a uh Mr Max thanks for the uh big 100 shout out Steve Norman he coined the Omega male term by the way um we

(1:09:10) have ten thousand about ten thousand five hundred people watching right now

(1:15:01) have I have a couple questions just to bring it back really quick to Justin um in terms of kind of your relationships with with women uh is it

(1:15:09) closed is it it's closed on their end right like you may have a couple girls

(1:15:16) here and there maybe more than a couple but they are exclusive to you is that

(1:15:21) correct just into into the mic if you yes okay what would you tell one of them

(1:15:27) if they wanted to be with other guys it was nice to know you it's not a

(1:15:32) problem yeah I look man I'm not forceful at all like this is a choice thing if if

(1:15:38) a woman sees it as a valuable thing then so be it and I Honestly though I think the way the conversation is going is

(1:15:44) it's like I have like 80 wives or some [ __ ] um but uh now if they want to go they

(1:15:50) can go man no problem that was what I expected yeah you should always be calm and respectful you never I don't believe

(1:15:55) in raising your voice and getting angry anything like that you know I have a question do you think marriage should be

(1:16:01) public what do you mean do you think that when you commit your life to someone and

(1:16:07) you're gonna build a family with them do you think that should be done in community so public look I I think

(1:16:13) that's up to the people that do it I don't think there's a right way to do it at all so it's up to you so you think

(1:16:18) like for children they shouldn't they don't have the right to know whether or not their parents are married and be

(1:16:24) able to feel that when they got into society yeah I think that if you're if your kids ask you should tell them the truth 100 there's no lie or no nothing I

(1:16:31) would ever keep from a child of mine meaning the truth about no we're not married I have other other people I'm sleeping with

(1:16:37) whatever they asked me I would answer I think as somebody that was raised by a single mom like those things they they

(1:16:45) don't matter as much to your child as you think that they may I mean it did have an effect on my relationships going

(1:16:52) growing up but it's also something like you can learn from that experience through your parents you know like you

(1:16:58) can as long as you have open communication with your child and I don't have any children but I have younger siblings and I'm openly

() 

(1:17:04) communicative with all my family members I think what's most important when it comes to kid is their love in the house do they see love between their parents

(1:17:11) not not are they living the way of of making people that go to church happy it's a very downward deflecting question

(1:17:18) you're asking me and I understand why you're doing it however I'll put love first in front of marriage every day of

(1:17:24) the week because people get married in America every weekend putting the marriage and the Facebook pictures before the actual love so I'll take the

(1:17:31) love over all the [ __ ] I think that's probably true there's a lot of it's definitely true there's a lot of hypocrisy for sure there's a lot of

(1:17:37) hypocrisy and Christianity as well like Bible thumping people that want to beat you up with their views and ask silly

(1:17:43) questions about things that don't matter like is your kid going to be upset that you have other women all I'm worried

(1:17:48) about is being a good [ __ ] father and a provider and giving them a life full of love and if I can do that I've been

(1:17:53) quite quite successful in fact I'd say more successful than most Christians so my understanding

(1:18:00) thought it totally wanting the best for the other person and that it's committed and that

(1:18:06) it's sacrificial and that it's exclusive it's faithful and Fidelity I think is a really important part of love and if you

(1:18:12) don't have Fidelity and love then you don't have the security and the opportunity for full vulnerability can I throw a hypothetical at you yeah

(1:18:18) please do if and this is a hypothetical please so please don't get offended but if your husband were to do something

(1:18:26) that was not okay with you whatsoever to the point where you did not any longer want to be with him whether that's

(1:18:32) cheating or something else that's just a no for you would you leave she would stay would you

(1:18:37) leave them to just please your your children and to keep your family together is that like some you're

(1:18:44) willing to risk your own happiness and well-being or even safety if it was something that was that extreme are you

(1:18:50) talking about abuse I'm I'm using a hypothetical okay whatever it is that would be like a straight like I need to

(1:18:56) leave this person would you stay with them just for the convenience and also the toxicity that it could bring into

(1:19:03) your household and inflicting your your children you know so my position is if and it's the position of the Catholic

(1:19:09) Church as well which is that if you're in a situation in a marriage that's abusive right it's causing harm to you

(1:19:14) or your children then you definitely should create separation you should leave you can actually get a legal divorce if you need to separate your

(1:19:21) assets but the position of the church and my belief is that marriage is forever

(1:19:26) um until death was part until death was part so you can marry someone and they become a screwball you know they totally

(1:19:32) mess up they they do bad things and you should separate from them for your protection of your kids protection but

(1:19:40) you then don't go on and just remarry and try to live another life now there's something in the case if you were lied

(1:19:46) to so there's something called annulment which some people say oh that's Catholic divorce it's actually not annulment is

(1:19:51) when the mayor it says if the marriage never happened because it's people were lying typically when they go into the marriage so like typically abusers don't

(1:19:58) just start abusing after marriage they're abusing before marriage too or they're lying so if they're lying to you in a serious way and you go into a

(1:20:04) marriage you weren't free able to freely choose that marriage and so afterwards you can request an annulment from the

(1:20:10) church and be like hey I don't think I was even married because I didn't freely choose this I didn't know this guy was a liar and you know addicted to

(1:20:16) pornography and abuse and all these things and so in that case you could nullify the marriage and then be free to be free to actually get married I want

(1:20:23) to say something just to be completely fair to you I think what you have in your marriage is absolutely beautiful no

(1:20:28) problem with it at all I think that if you two are happy and like living together in the Lord and like you see a

(1:20:34) future that even goes past his life to Heaven I think that's a beautiful beautiful thing no issue at all well and

(1:20:40) you should be commended for doing it you know properly well but not properly in regards to religion I don't mean to cut

(1:20:45) you off but properly in regards to like what you are setting out to do with him I think that's a beautiful thing well

(1:20:51) we're definitely imperfect people figuring it out right and that's what part of marriages is becoming better together you know in that total

(1:20:57) commitment to each other um but the thing is like I'm passionate about not just wanting it for myself right like I'm very grateful to be

(1:21:03) married it has rooted my life it has anchored my life it has changed my life but I don't want to just keep that to myself and be like oh this is just my

(1:21:09) personal thing over here I want other people to re to have the opportunity for that what do you think it takes for

(1:21:14) women to get in a position to find a husband that will commit to them fully and give their life to them what do you

(1:21:19) think that takes well I think the first step is working on yourself and your own development as a woman becoming the best

(1:21:26) that you can be and then having good standards for the man that you're going to be with like to be perfectly honest

(1:21:31) with you I would not ever date a guy who I thought would be unfaithful to me not even date him never if I found out my

(1:21:38) person I was dating is sleeping with other women or sleeping with anyone honestly because I don't I didn't have we didn't have sex before marriage I'd

(1:21:44) be like no I'm not I'm not interested but I ask you what what you think a woman needs to do I think the woman needs to become the best she can be she

(1:21:51) needs to grow psychologically be healthy if she needs to heal from trauma from her childhood a lot of us have baggage I

(1:21:56) had baggage go get the therapy that you need um really understand do you not do not believe that that therapy is in the

(1:22:03) church and Christianity do I not believe what do you not believe it's everything that you need as a church you can't just find that in the word well the beauty of

(1:22:10) so the beauty of Catholicism is it's very much focused on the whole person right so it's not like we're just Spiritual Beings right we're also bodies

(1:22:16) with desires with traumas with with experiences and so the psychological

(1:22:22) world and you know psychological health is an important part of bodily health and it connects to your spiritual health

(1:22:27) so therapy is great you know obviously we totally promote therapy for those that need it mental health is really

(1:22:33) important so just because you're doing the right thing spirit doesn't mean you're necessarily mentally healthy you may need to get mental health support

(1:22:39) too I think this is actually something a lot of people who are really spiritual fall into they think oh if I'm just pray enough I can make my depression go away

() 

(1:22:45) right and yes sometimes God does just heal depression like that but a lot of the time God uses natural means like a

(1:22:52) good therapist you know a good psychiatrist to help somebody through that or a good threesome Oh wrong I

(1:22:59) would say that that's going to decline someone's mental health in the end would be my might for some people but that's again like it's so unique to the person

(1:23:05) and I think so you're talking about like spiritual you talk about bodily mental we're also sexual we absolutely are

(1:23:10) that's the part like we have to find a way to helpfully channel that desire and for you that's through monogamous marriage for me that's tsunami monogamy

(1:23:17) and trusting like what is right for me is right for me what is right if it's right for you and back to your question

(1:23:22) too about you know what if all Society was like you but it's not it's a spectrum we have people all the way on the one extreme of monogamy we have

(1:23:29) other people on The Other Extreme to polyamory and like we're all summer across there and I think there's beauty in all of it depending Who You Are or

(1:23:35) what's good for you and so I don't think it has to be one or the other but Nick you're three years in right you're three

(1:23:41) years in living this way so look at look at 90 years look at 80s I'm thinking the same thing I don't know how old

(1:23:49) 200.69 Madison and Giselle is there anything you want to talk about

(1:23:55) yeah let's uh let's move things along a little bit here um so

(1:24:01) uh Kaiser Wilhelm the third you got anything it's okay yeah Chase do you want to pull up a little bit more today

(1:24:07) it's super hard not particularly it's not comfortable yeah I'm sitting sideways you guys are good you guys are

(1:24:13) good uh Matt Kaiser Wilhelm the third do you have anything to say

(1:24:19) okay I guess not Gisele what's up I mean I've mainly just been listening

(1:24:24) I'm not too into religion but I really am into love and monogamy and I think

(1:24:30) it's very special because I think all of us could have sex all the time if we wanted to and I think that's what makes

(1:24:36) having sex with a special person so special and that's just my viewpoint on

(1:24:41) it but I understand that we all have have we find happiness through different ways or through different means but I

(1:24:50) guess this is just how I choose to live my life I recommend you for having that point of

(1:24:55) view I really do I have a question do you think that like you're hyper sexual like has come from and

(1:25:03) I don't want to like pry but like Trauma from like maybe getting like molested or

(1:25:08) raped like bro what the [ __ ] not at all that's this common question that most only fans models get yeah it's like you

(1:25:14) have childhood trauma and like that's how afraid of pleasure we are that's how afraid we are of women who know what

(1:25:19) they want and let themselves have it we have to couch it in terms of she was probably traumatized as a child what if she's just a powerful woman who knows

(1:25:25) what she wants like we don't know what to do with a woman like that so we have to couch in terms of something had to have happened to her no no it was just a

(1:25:32) question no I'm just saying this is commonly the only fans world but when you see a man with a strong sexual desire sleeping with a bunch of women

(1:25:37) it's like they're looked up well a lot of times they call it the ego they say it's his ego that needs it right truly

(1:25:42) he just wants to have sex yeah it's like it's not it's well maybe some guys some guys because they're the ones that brag

(1:25:48) about well dude I will never brag about women I sleep with ever exactly the Chad and the um Alpha Male yeah

(1:25:56) that's super cringy yeah so I agree um I think those things are misconstrued

(1:26:01) sometimes though because I think some men just like literally have that kind of Drive in them like physically like coming out of them it tortures them I

(1:26:07) tell people all the time if I could stroke a check for a million dollars right now it ain't clear and that feeling never come to me again I would I

(1:26:13) would write the check I think that your drive whether it's your sexual drive or your drive for

(1:26:19) whatever you're aiming at right wealth or friendship you're lonely whatever it is it's powerful right and it can be

(1:26:25) channeled and so you know to what you were saying earlier um Justin is like you can Channel these things towards the

(1:26:32) end that you choose and so I think the big question is what is the end that we're going to choose that when we're 80 years old or 90 years old on our

(1:26:38) deathbed we're like you know are we going to be surrounded by that lifelong partner that spouse that we are faithful to our whole life and our kids who grew

(1:26:45) up in that intact home are we going to be alone or are we going to be you know what what kind of Life are we aiming

(1:26:50) around a polyamorous woman would not be alone at her funeral I'm gonna let you know that right now

(1:26:56) but that's what they know let's be real like let's let's show you guys like

(1:27:02) let's be real how long is this Merry-Go-Round Gonna Last right in my in my opinion I think go ahead Kirsten as

(1:27:07) women too we are also more wired to have an emotional connection to sex I can

(1:27:13) still have a high sex drive but have sex with one person if you start having sex with so many people and don't be wrong

(1:27:18) I'm the only fans model too so I I don't give a [ __ ] about that but like when you're having sex with so many people

(1:27:23) that as a woman there is no more emotional connection that clearly is some kind of issue well one thing I can

(1:27:30) say as a man is I know for a fact that a man can love a woman and sleep with other women and not be in love with those others men and women also wild

(1:27:35) completely different and I agree with you and that's right now that's why it's a problem for me that's a lot's a

(1:27:41) problem for me so if I love a girl there's no having sex with other guys because if she loves me she she doesn't

(1:27:46) even see other men yeah other men are invisible if you're in love with a man other other men are invisible and that's

(1:27:52) no disrespect to you I'm just I'm just saying that all women have to have an emotional connection to have sex that's

(1:27:58) not true and and in that same sense you know I feel as if like you know her and I we we see a little bit eye to eye on

(1:28:05) certain things but I see eye to eye with a lot of different people here because I have I'm I'm able to see different perspectives but I do want to do want to

(1:28:12) point out the fact that you know she was in a in a marriage where you said 12 years of course when she becomes single

(1:28:18) she's going to want to experiment and see what's going on outside of that I'm 21 years old I wasn't in a marriage but

(1:28:24) I was in a very toxic bad relationship for five years when I got out of that I wanted to just see what or maybe

(1:28:31) happened for me maybe it wasn't even that it was toxic it was just a long time ever that doesn't mean that it's going to be this way forever that

(1:28:36) doesn't mean that I can't meet the right person and put all my intentions into just one person that doesn't mean I'm incapable of commitment it just means

(1:28:43) that I'm 21 years old I'd rather focus on myself focus on what is best for me in this moment and not focus all my

(1:28:49) attention on to a man or woman or yeah and Rolo calls that the part of yours in his book so it's right in line with

(1:28:54) where you are age-wise I would argue though that you're not head over heels in love with your partner you know not

(1:29:00) not like obsessed you know that kind of love I'm talking just one sec while this comes in

(1:29:11) uh Thomas thing for the donation Thomas did you want to continue your point no okay

(1:29:17) I I do want to know the answers to the question how long do you think this Merry-Go-Round is going to last like as long as the Merry-Go-Round of monogamy

(1:29:23) lasts it's it's how people are wired when people who are wired for monogamy are going to be monogamous people are

(1:29:29) wired to be non-monogamous are going to be non-monogamous the root of my question is like right now it's fun

(1:29:34) because like there's a lot of people that want to have sex with you and like you're enjoying that companionship and all that kind of stuff but like what

(1:29:40) about when you're in your 50s and 60s and like 70s and all the people all the people that want to bang you now who

(1:29:46) don't want to commit to you like they're probably not going to be around please don't commit to me I'm not open for that but like don't you want that

(1:29:52) companionship when you're holding it with who with my person I'm dating my partner you think they're going to be

(1:29:57) around when you're in your 70s and so yeah and if not that's okay too I don't put pressure because I this is the big

(1:30:02) thing coming out of monogamous marriage we vow to be with each other until death do us part and then we parted long before death and it was really

(1:30:08) traumatizing because I'm like wait we said this but we're doing this so I've told anyone I date now in my person right now like I don't even want you to

(1:30:15) say that to me that is actually really alarming to me that because I don't know where you're going to be 30 years from now I don't know who I'm going to be 30

(1:30:20) years from now what if we could become totally different people I am not going to hold you to a promise you made 30

(1:30:25) years back I'd much rather instead of saying to me I'm going to spend the rest of my life with you I'd rather say I am

(1:30:30) so excited to wake up with you tomorrow morning I want to take it one day at a time make sure we're on the same page we're in alignment we are vibing things

(1:30:36) are amazing but if we start veering in different directions it is not my job to Reign you back in and force you back

(1:30:42) kind of adjusting to saying like you're free to leave like I don't control you your own person I'm free to leave and if

(1:30:48) I desire a long-term companionship I believe I can have that if I desire to have many partners over the rest of my

(1:30:53) life I believe I can have that I truly believe we get to have the desires of our heart I think the human condition is

(1:31:00) that things aren't always amazing right we have bad days we get sick terrible

(1:31:05) accidents can happen and so that's where the power of love comes in a love that doesn't leave a love that doesn't isn't

(1:31:12) based on feelings or desire but a love that's based on choice and I think deep down we're all wired for that even men

(1:31:18) even men that like like you were saying Justin I want to be with multiple women and everything I think deep down we want

(1:31:23) a love that stays a love that lasts and it is possible for everyone every single

() 

(1:31:28) person at this table I guarantee you a thousand percent it is possible for you not for asexual yeah but I would argue

(1:31:33) that like who are you to tell me that I'm not going to be happy because I don't choose your path yes I don't think I said that that pretty much you

(1:31:39) reframed it in that way so who are you to say that I will say do you think I'm going to be less happy than you I think

(1:31:45) that if you live your life and you said you're not sharing whether or not you're doing this so we're all talking in

(1:31:50) hypotheticals so I don't know exactly how you're living right you didn't share that but if hypothetically you live your life where you are starting multiple

(1:31:57) families with multiple women what if I have one family and 50 girlfriends I think in the end it will bring great

(1:32:03) unhappiness to your family to your children to the mother of your children and to you okay cool

(1:32:11) I just wanna I just want to clarify what you're so kind of related to this um let's let's speak a little bit on

(1:32:17) marriage really quick so uh uh I agree with you Justin I think marriage is

(1:32:24) an L especially for men I mean you're an incredibly successful guy and I think you previously stated hey look oh I

(1:32:31) didn't get to my position in life to marry someone and it'd be a liability where she could potentially uh change

(1:32:38) your mind so I agree with you there and especially I mean with uh stats as they are I think

(1:32:44) it's something like 80 of marriages end in divorce or sorry excuse me 50 of marriages end in divorce 80 of those are

() 

(1:32:51) initiated by women so men are disproportionately impacted by the

(1:32:57) negative Well there's almost it's almost entirely negative outcomes of divorce so

(1:33:03) um I I and I but Chase I know we've kind of had a back and forth on the whole

(1:33:08) marriage thing and I think kind of my point is that you could have a long-term even life partner with

(1:33:14) someone and not get married to them and I mean I think the two things I'd point to recently uh granted this one isn't as

(1:33:21) strong of a case as I previously thought but you look at for example what happened with Stephen Crowder now

(1:33:26) there's been some videos that came out and that don't exactly paint him in the most flattering light but you know Steve

(1:33:32) makes it easy to understand why his wife would leave yeah now granted it's a it's a three-minute clip of an otherwise

(1:33:40) multi-year-long marriage people have bad day bad days he doesn't look good

(1:33:46) granted he does not look good in that in that moment but you look at the the

(1:33:51) context of his marriage they were both virgins both religious um even they got divorced you have we

(1:33:59) have you you're a yeah but I gotta say something hold on you're

(1:34:04) ex-pastor I imagine you were quite Pious when you were a pastor you were you got

(1:34:10) married I assumed to a Pious man were you uh when you got married were you were you both virgins if I don't know if

(1:34:16) that's too prying but no we were not but you were both deeply religious and so I

(1:34:21) look at that and I look even at the deeply religious person where you know there's uh people who are agnostic or

(1:34:27) who are secular who get married and I you know it would occur to me that people that are religious have even like

(1:34:34) a at least logically with you would think well there's the religious component to marriage so those are potentially

(1:34:40) stronger but you look at I mean and I looked at the the data I think I think religious people Edge out secular people

(1:34:48) a little more in terms of staying together but it it still ain't looking great either people who are religious Brian the data

(1:34:55) the data on people who are actually attending church and they take the religion seriously they don't just call

(1:35:01) themselves Christian there's a big difference in those data sets versus the people that actually take it seriously

(1:35:07) right and to call her marriage Pious or to call Crowders marriage Pious is not actually fair to people that are truly

(1:35:14) honoring what the word of God tells us to do for example no offense but female Pastor not not

(1:35:20) living in alignment with the word of God right Paul was clear we're not supposed to have female pastors okay so that's

(1:35:26) that's not that's not an example of piety Stephen Crowder right the way that he was speaking to his wife

(1:35:32) look it's it's one moment in time it's three minutes it's you know there's no way to extrapolate that out to the rest

(1:35:37) of their lives with certainty but if those three minutes were a representation of the rest of the

() 

(1:35:44) way that he was approaching his marriage it's like that's not how we're called to treat our wives when we're we're serious

(1:35:50) about our walk with Christ you know like he was speaking to her in a very aggressive and like

(1:35:56) I don't know man like like she she was just asking to like use the car and go get groceries and stuff

(1:36:02) and the way he was speaking to her was so like condescending and rude and he was treating her like [ __ ] you know what I mean it's like I watched that clip and

(1:36:09) I'm like I'm not surprised she wanted to leave him if if I was a woman and I had been with a guy like that for years and

(1:36:15) he had been treating me like that for years I'd be like yeah I probably you know want to get out of this marriage right it's like it's verbal abuse you

(1:36:21) know but there's a difference between that versus somebody who is actually striving to live by the tenets of the

(1:36:27) word of God and who is who you know who is loving their wife as he loves himself and who is sacrificing for her and who

(1:36:34) treats her like gently and with compassion and if the wife is doing the same to her husband then she's you know

(1:36:39) submitting to her husband and she's loving him effectively and she follows his leadership and he is a good leader you're going to have totally different

(1:36:45) marital outcomes with couples like that right well and it's really interesting because the step when they do studies

(1:36:51) about sexual satisfaction for women they find that women who are married in

(1:36:58) monogamous face full marriages and they are going to church regularly like weekly

(1:37:04) share that they have the highest sexual satisfaction and super low divorce rates

(1:37:09) there's so much data out there that women get more orgasms and more pleasure from women than they do to men but

(1:37:15) that's because the men is that man is probably not a good lover to them yeah that's the majority of the situations

(1:37:21) you see that's the beauty of a lifelong marriage it's like you learn to love each other not just like in doing chores

(1:37:26) for each other doing fun things together but in how you have sex you learn to really love each other what do you do if one partner has a high

(1:37:33) libido and one partner has a low libido well you work through that so one has to starve sexually and one no you feel

(1:37:39) guilty you are not sacrifice like was that the case in your marriage no but I'm just I just know examples

(1:37:45) where men like but either gender one gender is like I have no drive so I can't well if a guy I'll answer that if

() 

(1:37:52) a guy has no drive and the woman has a high drive he should go get his testosterone levels checked right because a guy a guy who's just gonna say

(1:37:58) a guy who's healthy he's like he's gonna want sex you know but if he has no if he has no sexual drive stressed out or he's

(1:38:05) not eating well he's not or even or even vice versa like if a woman is in in having the same sex drive like that's I

(1:38:12) don't know I mean I think when it comes in then is there something wrong with the woman I think when it comes down to as emotionally into a relationship if

(1:38:19) she's not yeah it doesn't have that high sex drive because when with my ex he had a really high sex drive and I don't I

(1:38:27) really don't care for sex but with him I was down to do whatever because you loved it every single day yeah yeah

(1:38:32) however many times and that's the design of monogamous love and marriage is that you learn to love each other and this

(1:38:38) idea of like sexual incompatibility I think is a total myth I think it's a lie and people believe it and so they have

(1:38:44) sex before marriage but people have who have sex before marriage and sleep together or cohabitate actually have worse outcomes once married they're more

(1:38:50) likely to divorce not a lot of people know that that's what the social data says but that's because when you're in

(1:38:55) it for life and you're in it to really love this person to be committed and learn them and do whatever you can for

(1:39:00) them you learn pleasure with them you learn how to love not just sex with them but your entire life with them and you

(1:39:07) work at it together I think it's because when you're like monogamous like the when you're with someone longer like

(1:39:12) just them you learn to communicate like what you like in dislike in the bedroom like what do I say I like non-monogamy

(1:39:20) no I'm saying like you know what I mean no but like I'm saying when you're with it's like I love you and I want group

(1:39:26) sex well I think if you want it if you want to cheat on somebody and you're married to them I think you make the decision not to

(1:39:32) yeah and that's that's where I have different beliefs from religion which is about sacrifice I believe in honoring desires and like again I'm not saying I

(1:39:39) I think go on a whim and just do whatever but I think like I think that actually is true love can you love me in my fullness and in my fullness I'm not

(1:39:45) monogamous and my fullness I want to have sex with other people and my fullness I'm very sexual if that's too

(1:39:50) much for you I can't be with you and I bless and release you see I think you're making an identity out of your desires

(1:39:56) but your identities what you desire you're making your identity out of your desires just because minor sexual you're

(1:40:03) making that about me but you make an identity out of your desires for monogamy for marriage for procreation

(1:40:08) that's your identity I I all make our identities around our desires it's not just for sex I think there's a lot of

(1:40:14) Truth to what you're saying the question is what desire will you be defined by your sexual impulse and urge or will you

(1:40:19) be defined by something much bigger or is your identity based on controlling your desire

(1:40:26) it's about channeling it make sure that you don't let him take advantage of your

(1:40:31) compassion towards him I'd add one quick thing is find a good Mentor like a man that you can respect and that is living

(1:40:37) a faithful fruitful life and try to learn from that man and there are good men out there even when we're hurt by

(1:40:44) bad ones yeah I didn't my dad I didn't meet him until I was like 12 and he was never a father to me either and so I'm

(1:40:51) so sorry you lent like all your savings to your dad for that um and I hope you find a guy that can be

(1:40:58) a father figure in your life that's super sad have you guys been reading the super chatter was just that one popped

(1:42:18) right all Pharmaceuticals derive from things that ultimately occur in nature but you can't be patient patent AKA make

(1:42:26) money if people know they can get it from there nature hence why Farm

(1:42:32) companies chemically remake or structure drugs so they can patent them to profit

(1:42:38) you read so much quicker on your live stream by the way because it's closer here probably yeah

(1:42:45) fair enough okay big farm is profiting off the sickness of mankind can I say

(1:42:50) something I like because my brother is a raw vegan I was a raw vegan for about a year and it can cure cancer dead like

(1:42:58) dead ass like going raw vegan and literally cure cancer like big Pharma profits off of chemotherapy

() 

(1:43:04) um they want us they want people to stay sick because chemo is not curing cancer

(1:43:10) it's just killing all your cells in the hopes that the cancer doesn't come back but the remission rate is like very low

(1:43:16) so like I'm very passionate about like how big Pharma is just trying to give

(1:43:21) kids meds like kids don't need to be taking Adderall that's like prescription meth while we're on the topics you want

(1:45:45) have uh pptsd yeah I was pegging dramatic stress disorder there we go and

(1:45:51) then we have Liam La go ahead Chase and the girl in the white shirt where in the Bible does it say that

(1:45:57) having multiple wives are bad can you give a specific example also David and

(1:46:03) Solomon differ you want this one well Jesus himself says that we allowed you

(1:46:09) to divorce and that was wrong and marriage is between one man and one woman this is a man that never got

(1:46:15) married wait what that's true oh Jesus Jesus yeah he was also the Son of God and the

(1:46:20) ultimate Authority on mankind so um also in Genesis it says the same right after God creates Adam and Eve he

(1:46:27) says this is why How does it go this is why a man leaves his parents or Amen to his wife yeah and the two become one one

(1:46:34) flesh so the polygamy thing was actually not God's original design but it was it

(1:46:42) people did it because they have free will right people can choose to do things like that and in the end it's not it wasn't God's solution

(1:46:48) to have sex with I will also hold on I will also add to one of the commit God

(1:46:53) told the Israelites not to accumulate three things wealth chariots and wives because he said that the three things

(1:46:59) would to to collect those three things would turn their hearts from God chariots yeah so like cars and [ __ ] uh

() 

(1:47:06) basically growing their armies right oh chair so the Chariots are like cars but like Olden cars like yeah ancient whips

(1:47:14) bro so if the Israelites happened I'm gonna I'm gonna keep buying Lambos

(1:47:21) yeah the point the point was don't he was telling the Kings don't put your faith in your armies rather than me

(1:47:26) right and he was also telling them don't collect multiple wives because they'll turn your hearts for me and you look at the kings that did that Solomon being

(1:47:34) the best example it turned his heart from the Lord on the topic of Chariots Justin how many

(1:47:40) chariots do you have um quite a few chariots you said you had a Lambo no I actually just gave my

(1:47:46) position my myself permission after I bought my last big property to buy Lambo so I'm gonna pull the G-Wagon back to

(1:47:53) Louisiana with the King Ranch and put a Lambo in Miami let's go Justin was not

(1:47:59) sorry yeah well not sorry about anything what's your favorite whip

(1:48:41) no I'll just buy another one oh okay

(1:48:47) so uh just curious so you're are you part-time in Dubai part-time in the South and then

(1:48:53) part-time in Florida so I have my place in Florida I have a big house in Louisiana and my house in Dubai is being

(1:48:59) built right now it's a it's an 11 000 square foot I'm super pumped about it it's gonna have a gym send them a

(1:49:04) private beach infinity pool and across from the Tates so I can wave

(1:49:09) with my multiple wives or one wife depending on what day is it on that

(1:49:15) island or whatever no no it's not on the birds but they're building it that way so it's a whole community that is going

(1:49:22) to mimic the Mediterranean so we're going to live in the neighborhood Venice but they're going to have Morocco and

(1:49:27) all like all the different you know Mediterranean cities uh in the development outdoor movie theaters coral

(1:49:33) reefs is going to be incredible I'm really excited about it it's called The lagoons if you look at all the lagoons okay are you are you uh

(1:49:40) are you going to become a citizen of uh is it the Au no I'll get the golden Visa

(1:49:46) because of the investment in the country but I have no interest right now in renouncing my citizenship I'm very

(1:49:52) patriotic I believe in America I think America's a goat I believe anybody that doesn't love America can get the [ __ ]

(1:49:57) out let's go I'm very very much for America starting to come together and stop hating each other and writing from

(1:50:03) within let's let go of the gender the race Wars the whole thing like we are the [ __ ] goat and any nobody wants to

(1:50:09) smoke so if we can fix that internally we'll stay the greatest and um I'm not

(1:50:14) coming off of that until they take my gun rights away let's go based I have a I have a question

(1:50:20) um I don't know if you intend to have more kids if you do how would you like would you intend to shuttle them between your property yeah like like

(1:50:27) one of my daughters has been to Dubai multiple times I fly my kids all over the world uh FaceTime watch them go to

(1:50:34) sleep at night I'm a good father when I'm home we're playing basketball every night at Sunset

(1:50:39) um I'm making birthday parties I'm doing all that [ __ ] I'll be the best ad on the planet I have a lot of free time if I

(1:50:46) need it because of the way I work in the in the in the career that I've built and

(1:50:51) I'm getting paid in my sleep so I'll be there as much if not more than the next guy and most importantly in a world

(1:50:57) where men have gone to war for years and years and years or I have 200 employees in my construction company that live on the road I'm going to be a very

(1:51:03) impactful father they're not going to forget their moments with me because they're going to be moments that they'll never forget you know and I'm trying to

(1:51:08) create that kind of magic in my children's lives and then when they get of age I'm going to start you know

(1:51:13) teaching them how the world works like I said make them competent enough to create choice in their life and whatever choice they choose after that is fine

(1:51:20) with me they can go whatever route they want I'll still love them I'm not here to dictate their life I'm here to be impactful in it

(1:51:26) whether you know whether you can get behind it or not or whether that's what Jesus wants me to do I don't know but

(1:51:32) there's going to be love for sure I gotta ask another question hypothetically you have a hundred kids right I'm not I'm not going to do that

(1:51:37) by the way what what where would you set the max at 40 40. I'm talking [ __ ] I

(1:51:44) don't know I have no idea I don't have plans to like I don't have this big plan for kids I'm just keeping keeping the

(1:51:50) amount of kids I have vague maybe I have maybe I have four maybe I have ten I'm just trying to keep it vague question

(1:51:55) would you adopt if you wanna hell no no no no no no no no no no okay damn it I

(1:52:01) want it my genetics are way too [ __ ] good to

(1:52:06) adopt no no way yeah that option is beautiful yeah good for you not me

(1:52:12) hahaha is it is Dubai like really pretty I've never been beautiful it's a society

(1:52:17) that sustains itself unlike Southern California there's no homeless on the street there's real order you [ __ ] around I could leave my watch on the

(1:52:23) sidewalk you know whether whether you get behind Dubai or not you have to respect to buy

(1:52:29) and that's something I've lost a lot of a lot of respect for is is some of these beautiful places like South South

(1:52:34) California I walk through Santa Monica other day you couldn't go one block without somebody screaming f-bombs homeless

(1:52:41) and that's what I talk about when I talk about America we need to clean our [ __ ] up we're we're placating to less than

(1:52:47) one percent of the population so we don't hurt people's feelings but what about the children walking down the street that want to see the pier you

(1:52:53) know what about those moments with family you know California you know we actually cut checks for homeless people here in California it's one of the

(1:53:00) things that needs to end California pays you to be homeless but wait why is Biden

(1:53:05) giving money to like the Ukraine why can't you just like get like all the homeless people off the street because

(1:53:11) war is profitable and Democrats like to do that kind of [ __ ] and inflate the money that's why we left weapons in in

(1:53:17) you know Iraq Iran you know this the whole thing is [ __ ] I don't want to say too too much because I'm not trying

(1:53:23) to get my channel taken down yeah but don't believe what you see I don't California has a lot of issues though

(1:53:28) it's really sad because I grew up here and watching it go downhill has been pretty sad coming to you live from Santa

(1:53:35) Barbara California beautiful here but yeah California Stan uh as it's called okay so uh I think we

(1:53:43) have uh this one here from VD cars thank you for the hundred Giselle go ahead at Liam La the Bible describes polygamy it

() 

(1:53:50) does not prescribe it okay VD cars thank you venerio actually

(1:53:55) does an excellent job showing the downsides of polygamy too the what side the downsides

(1:54:03) okay we had something here we had to pull up hold on one sec um so Nicole you

(1:54:09) were on Dr Phil and in that interview you said you never felt more holy sacred

(1:54:14) or true after your nude photo shoot that is correct holy yes it's like I can literally I

(1:54:22) like as I peeled off my layers and it was like literally me before God no hiding no shame nothing and I never felt

(1:54:29) more alive and connected to who I really am in that moment and I got my car afterwards and I bawled because I'm like

(1:54:35) I found that this is how I was meant to live I I joke but it's kind of serious I was meant to take my clothes off and my

(1:54:42) whole life I spent covering up being modest by someone else's prescription for me when I found that I the truest

(1:54:48) version of me is when I'm there's nothing between me and God so you don't you don't believe that God is the god of

(1:54:54) the Bible then no I don't believe in the Bible anymore correct so who do you think God is like just some images there

(1:55:00) is a God maybe there is maybe there's not I'm open so you're an atheist I'd say more

(1:55:07) agnostic um okay and and you also said in that video I saw you said sex workers are

(1:55:14) typically the healthiest humans um does that include the herpes and HPV

(1:55:20) you know it's interesting that that's a stigma because most people the common person who's not a sex worker never gets

(1:55:26) tested versus sex workers get tested every single month or hot depending how active they are and are the most on top

(1:55:33) of their STIs but there's nothing wrong with STIs sdas are common if your person is having sex with another person you're

(1:55:38) at risk of getting an STI and so we have to drop the stigma that somehow it means to your gross or icky it's just like we're all at risk

(1:55:45) for it and it's just knowing that all sdas are manageable or curable and just get tested it's not a problem

(1:55:51) no offense or anything but I mean I think herpes is disgusting you might have it most people carry herpes and

(1:55:58) don't even know you're talking about the hs1 virus mouth herpes yeah I'm talking about people I'm talking about like

(1:56:03) genital herpes yeah most people don't have genitals we actually do the data most people do and they because it's

(1:56:09) asymptomatic majority of the time and it often gets mistaken for a pimple that

(1:56:15) people don't realize that they have it herpes breakouts are much more severe yeah sure some people are asymptomatic

(1:56:21) however if you are symptomatic my understanding and from the literature

(1:56:26) I've seen and what I've seen online photographs it's part of it I'm in a

(1:56:33) sexware community we talk about STIs all the time we're very educated versus the research has passed around to scare

(1:56:39) people like this could happen to you when it's often just a pimple but people don't talk about that because that

(1:56:45) doesn't scare people away from sex and into absence well I think you're you're now on the opposite side of the propaganda because to conflate her a

(1:56:51) herpes outbreak with just a pimple I think there are people who have like pretty

(1:56:56) debilitating breakouts where they're in like severe pain it can cause scarring I mean there's

(1:57:01) that might be an extreme case but again majority are asymptomatic never have a flare-up and then for most people

(1:57:07) outside of that when you have a single flare-up it is the only time you'll ever have it are we defending her like I'm just yeah

(1:57:14) I'm trying to destigmatize people having STIs because we're making it sound like it's horrific and it's it's because

(1:57:20) you're sleeping with all these people you can get it sleeping with one person and not even know yeah but if you if you sleep sure right the very and I've I

(1:57:27) actually knew a girl who the first time she ever had sex was a virgin hooked up with this guy she got herpes right

(1:57:34) um tragic that's pretty rare though and uh I would say the more sexual partners

(1:57:39) you have uh the greater likelihood you are to eventually get an STD and that's

(1:57:45) why you do protection that's why you get tested that's why you communicate up front do you want to use barriers if so what kind there's all kinds of

(1:57:51) conversations but I find people who are not in the sex work industry just sleep around and hope for the best and never get tested you said that but that's not

(1:57:58) true I don't sleep around a lot like my body Count's not high but I get tested

(1:58:03) every time I have sex with anyone like everyone do that and also just because

(1:58:08) you're in the sex industry it doesn't mean you're automatically going to catch something I promise like I again I do

(1:58:14) only fans and I'm still only sleeping with my boyfriend so it doesn't mean I'm sleeping around with other people just

(1:58:20) because I have an only Fan's room in the sex industry it's a common misconception that if you do adult work if you do only

(1:58:25) fans you sleep with everybody that's not true sure not necessarily I

(1:58:31) mean and I I think sex work is kind of a uh it's yeah it's like that's that's

(1:58:37) anywhere from like tasteful lingerie to being a street prostitute I think it's not a particularly helpful term and I

(1:58:43) don't know if lumping these two groups of people really is doing them any any favors but when it comes to like for

(1:58:50) example STDs uh I I would say that they have done studies and I my

(1:58:56) understanding is like for example if you're doing traditional porn where you're doing a new scene with someone

(1:59:01) every every week whatever maybe I don't know the frequency that's average in in

(1:59:06) the industry but you are at a much greater risk even with all the testing

(1:59:12) that they do of getting HPV and getting herpes so and additionally you said protection uh you can get herpes even if

(1:59:20) you're wearing a condom then you use dental dams yeah of course it's that it can be like on your hip or like herpes

(1:59:26) breakout can be not on the shaft or so you can still get herpes and I look I'm

(1:59:34) I'm not trying to get herpes you know what I'm saying yeah I'm not trying to get that have sex or use protection using protection does not preclude you

(1:59:42) from getting herpes to be away from getting uh ones like

(1:59:47) syphilis or things like that those can be transmitted as simply as me sharing the puppet with you like it's saliva

(1:59:53) like you can kiss somebody and get an STD it's not it's not um it doesn't Define you as a bad or doing something

(1:59:59) wrong or being icky or being gross and another thing is is in schools all they

(2:00:04) tell you is sex big red button wear a glove if you're gonna press the big red button like how is that going to teach

(2:00:10) anybody how to actually use protection it's just telling kids don't have sex if you do have sex wear a condom and then

(2:00:18) just sending them out into the into the world not giving them enough information at all whatsoever I don't know like

() 

(2:00:24) I think sexually transmitted diseases should kind of be stigmatized hot take I

(2:00:33) agree I agree Brian I got your back it's not ideal you're back bro I don't know look if you have if I mean okay hold on

(2:00:42) hold on if you get an STD that's incurable you shouldn't be like

(2:00:48) excommunicated you shouldn't be excised from society but like you have to real like this this idea of not stigmatizing

(2:00:56) it um I wouldn't like talk [ __ ] or be like oh look that [ __ ] herp derper you

(2:01:02) know I wouldn't say any [ __ ] like that however I don't even know what the terms are however like I think if if a girl

(2:01:09) disclosed to me that she had herpes and I think most men would agree most men are going to be like [ __ ] no I don't

(2:01:16) want to deal with it and me personally like I think dating is hard enough as it is as a guy bro I'm not trying to [ __ ]

(2:01:23) like if I were if I were to get uh herpes bro I'm gonna [ __ ] be that's

(2:01:28) that's an additional handicap I don't know if any of you play golf bro you're handicapping your [ __ ] if you get herpes

(2:01:34) I'm just saying it's hard enough as it is

(2:01:40) have just spiked more and more that people think hookup culture is okay and you know having sex before marriage or

(2:01:46) having sex with multiple people is okay so I don't know it's really sad actually because we could solve that with

(2:01:52) deciding not to just have sex with multiple people that a woman had sex one time and she got STI so there's no 100

(2:01:58) but she said full proof that you could not get an STI and again you can get it having sex one time but

(2:02:06) again this goes back to my the point that I was making earlier in the conversation what would happen to society if everybody had the same value

(2:02:11) who cares who cares I I care as a member of society don't have sex I'm already

(2:02:17) being abstinate but my point is you're you're you're advocating for like hey everybody just [ __ ] whoever you want

(2:02:22) don't care about the STIs everybody would just say that everybody would get diseases like that's what you're proposing here that you project that I'm

(2:02:28) just saying you're saying we should destigmatize it and Society would run fine if everybody had these beliefs but

(2:02:34) it wouldn't let me finish I can tell you what I would say is that that people get to choose the risk they're willing to

(2:02:39) take so if you want no risk choose abstinence if you want some risk you're going to choose some sexual activity if

(2:02:45) you're fine with more risk you're going to expose yourself like there's no one right or wrong when it comes to risk

(2:02:50) it's knowing your risk tolerance and making informed decisions and then if you are sexually active get tested

(2:02:55) regularly there's nothing wrong with that I mean yeah hold on hold on go ahead I'm happy

(2:03:04) I've never been happier so you don't feel like there's nothing wrong no I used to feel like something was wrong

(2:03:09) before kind of like what Justice was Justin was saying before I finally honored the fullness of who I am when I

(2:03:14) kept trying to be monogamous when I kept trying to lower my sexual libido when I kept trying to be who everyone else told

(2:03:20) me should be as a woman as a wife as a mother I was miserable when I finally got clear on who do I want to be as a

(2:03:26) person as a woman as a partner as a mother my happiness went through the roof I think if everybody lived in a way where

(2:03:33) they were honoring the fullness of who they are we would have a disease-ridden society well but I think that but I

(2:03:39) think the fullness of who we are changes depending on our feelings our experiences and even our traumas and so

(2:03:46) I think that that can be very misleading like what does it mean you mentioned Soulful desire versus like a surface

(2:03:51) desire and I think that what does how do you discern between the two and the

(2:03:56) reality is our hearts can mislead us and it's the way you discern it and

(2:04:03) that's why moral reality no I think each person has a discern for themselves if we just make up all of our morality all

(2:04:09) the time we're inevitably going to hurt other people what if I make my non-monogamy it's a societal rule you

(2:04:15) have to you have a chaotic and broken Society Society civilization would collapse I love it that's how we feel

(2:04:20) about monogamy when you try to force your values on someone else people will cheat people will lie I don't think and

(2:04:26) I don't think Chase would force want to force anybody to get married marriage should be freely chosen so no

() 

(2:04:33) one should be forced to be monogamous in that sense but I do think we have a responsibility and that involves the

(2:04:38) choices we make with whether or not we have sex and that's a choice that we make we're not doomed to have sex or not we can choose no I'm not going to have

(2:04:45) sex because I know that there's consequences that can result from that like really good consequences

(2:04:53) like there's so much good we only focus on the bad because pregnancy is not expecting fatherless homes

(2:04:59) there are 2500 babies killed every day in this country because they were unwanted because people had sex that

(2:05:07) weren't ready to be parents with people they didn't want to actually be with people have used contraception and it's fail it's not because so they have to

(2:05:13) have options to if they don't want the baby they do everything in their power to not have to have it that's social why should children have to die because

(2:05:18) adults just want to live they're just cells before they're born as a baby you're just cells right now okay

(2:05:25) but you have a right to live and the child has a right to live in the womb sure do you guys want to continue that

(2:05:31) discussion no it's all it's done well I'm happy to not interested

(2:05:36) question for the girls would any of you date someone who is pro-life

(2:05:43) yes since we're on the topic um I I guess my question is what do you

(2:05:48) mean by pro-life you mean Pro forced birth not interested if you mean life from womb to the tomb you care about all

(2:05:55) degrees you care about children who are born and have no resources you care about homeless children you care about immigrant children you care about

(2:06:01) children who don't have protection or provision then I'm all about that you are very good at manipulating

(2:06:08) language Nick sure you're very very good at manipulating language call it but I think well that's I mean you just you

(2:06:14) just did it she someone asked if you're pro-life or if you would date somebody who is because

(2:06:20) Force birth in America that's my point Pro forced birth because once a kid is born in America do we provide resources

(2:06:26) do we have Universal Health Care do we provide schooling or do we care for our children we don't please hold on

(2:06:32) couples waiting to adopt with the acceptance with the exception with the

(2:06:38) exception of rape nobody's forcing somebody to give birth okay when people stop stop please

(2:06:46) please let me make my point I can interject yeah you can but it's incredibly rude and disrespectful okay no it's not it's not okay with me

(2:06:52) as long as you continue doing it I'm going to tell you to stop people when when people get raped then you could you

(2:06:58) could call it forced birth okay if people choose to have consensual sex

(2:07:04) nobody's forcing the birth of that child they made the choice to have consensual sex and and then and then the birth

(2:07:10) happens what'd you say sex and procreation are two different things right but when somebody has sex when

(2:07:15) somebody exactly when somebody has sex they're risking procreation so the two are

(2:07:21) obviously intertwined like like I know you're saying that

(2:07:27) chase because it's like that's the way people think today is oh I'm gonna have sex and risk procreation when creating a

(2:07:33) new human life is so amazing not if you don't have resources not if you don't have money the thing is the thing is

(2:07:38) people people don't think about the fact that they're risking procreation no that's why we're in the situation that's

(2:07:44) true but also what if people chose not to have sex until they were in a

(2:07:50) relationship publicly with someone they were committed to for life and prepared to have children that might come from

(2:07:55) that we'd have a lot less murdered babies I would not have a job I would not have

(2:08:01) a job you're a talented woman you would you would forget oh I I knew but I would not have my favorite

(2:08:07) one yes you I I think you you're better than the job that your favorite job

(2:08:12) I mean I don't think that there's a a sense of oh I'm better or worse if I do

(2:08:18) or don't do what I'm comfortable doing with my own body yes I just think you deserve more than men I think that I

(2:08:24) deserve the world and I'm willing to do whatever it takes to get it and if that means that as a woman that is

(2:08:30) independent on her own since 17 years old and that's what I want to do then that's what I'm going to do I have a

(2:08:35) question for both of you guys for uh Alan Kirsten Kirsten Kirsten how long do

(2:08:42) you guys plan on doing only fans for I personally want to do it until I do decide to kind of settle down have a

(2:08:48) family and stuff like that just because I do see the targets going to put on people's on children's backs I had an old management who she was huge in the

(2:08:56) porn industry and her kids and everybody knew that she was in the porn industry and her kids were severely bullied for

(2:09:03) that and I think at that point it's like I yes I I love the fast money that it is

(2:09:10) now but I don't want to do this my entire life do you want to marry your boyfriend that you do only fans with so

(2:09:16) to my knowledge you just do it with your boyfriend right correct and you make sex videos correct if you don't mind me

(2:09:22) asking I'm just I don't know okay so you guys but you guys don't like show your

(2:09:27) face or anything you just do it depends on the video I figured I I decided to go

(2:09:32) all in okay I wasn't fully explicit until about a year into it when I was with my boyfriend and I just decided you

(2:09:39) know what I'm already doing this I'm already being stereotyped to do this I might as well make as much money money

(2:09:46) use that for the rest of my life but you want to marry you want to marry him are you concerned at all about like the fact

(2:09:52) that you already have so much stuff out there and your kids could be bullied for that one um I mean that's definitely obviously a concern but I think it's one

(2:10:03) going all in on it I might as well like again it's always a possibility but

(2:10:11) what are your long-term goals um I want to own as many businesses as possible I'm investing a lot of my only

(2:10:16) fans money currently so I don't have to work a day in my life I don't like being told what to do I want to be my own boss

(2:10:22) and I just want to run a [ __ ] ton of businesses and have people work for me but in terms of family and stuff I do

(2:10:28) want a family with with the boyfriend you do with no I mean ideally yes yeah okay oh how long do you plan on

(2:10:34) continuing um so I don't have like a I'm I don't

(2:10:40) have like a cut off date but I also don't um I don't I'm not like delusional in

(2:10:46) the sense that I believe that that's what I can do forever I'm aware that my appearances only going to last so long

(2:10:52) in the sense that you know I'm not going to be 55 years old doing doing of

(2:10:58) personally not that there's anything wrong with that but um I do want to have like a family one day and maybe an

(2:11:05) alternative way or uh or a way like you you know I I I'm not sure it depends on

(2:11:10) the future and what it holds for me but I definitely have my own moral compass and I have other sources of income and

(2:11:17) other things that I can turn to for income so it's not that I've that I feel trapped that I feel trapped that I have

(2:11:23) to do it it's something that I enjoy for the time being I have a question for Mr Waller here

(2:11:28) do you think only fans is a net negative net positive or neutral for society and

(2:11:34) the health of society and women and men

(2:11:39) I think it's a net negative but I can see where a lot of young women feel like they have nowhere to go

(2:11:45) because men are so [ __ ] weak these days and they have this opportunity to make this easy money and regardless of

(2:11:51) my opinion of it which I do think is a net negative I think it's going to continue to grow as as men continue to

(2:11:57) bend to it it's everything that's wrong with Society right now is men's faults it's weak men's fault so we put up

(2:12:03) certain things we don't show up in certain ways so women don't feel safe enough to let go so they want to be bad

(2:12:09) [ __ ] and all these other things instead of taking the traditional feminine frame inside of a relationship

(2:12:14) with a man that's a man that she can trust or lead and the reason that women are doing these types and most women

(2:12:20) that have an only fans account in my opinion if they found a man that was strong that they knew would support him

(2:12:25) and they trusted him to be inside the frame and let him lead the mission they would put the only fans down

(2:12:30) absolutely I would love to be a stay at home I'd be a stay-at-home mom if your

(2:12:37) boyfriend was making enough money would you just stop I yeah I I would gladly do that if they decided I want you to stay

(2:12:44) home you do all the cooking you do all the cleaning you take care of the kids I would gladly do that and get behind the mission completely so you're making all

(2:12:51) the money for your Universe no not at all so so let's let's zoom out for a second he just touched on an interesting

(2:12:57) subject which is the masculinity crisis do you guys see a crisis in masculinity in the world um oh yeah yeah yeah hold

(2:13:03) on just a second chance to make such a good point we'll come back [Music] okay can you put some passages and names

(2:13:10) from the Lesser key of Solomon to see if we get a reaction from that upstanding

(2:13:16) that's a good one that's a good one um anything passages he's basically in

(2:13:23) like in The Testament of Solomon he's talking about the fact that there are demons and uh he's implying that she's

(2:13:29) possessed by demons confirm or deny take it confirm or deny whatever you want so I I hold on hold on confirmed and

(2:13:36) confirm or deny possessed by demons depends what you call a demon demons are liberated empowered woman I guess so

(2:13:42) like it's what is it well it's funny because uh The Liberation and empowerment of women actually has occult

(2:13:48) underpinnings and many many of these many of the early feminist authors actually explicitly worshiped Lucifer

(2:13:54) and Satan as the Liberator of women I love these conspiracy theories it's not a conspiracy theory they openly wrote

() 

(2:14:00) about it there's a book called satanic feminism look it up people the early feminist writers openly worship Lucifer and say uh chase the crisis of

(2:14:06) masculinity yeah so to get back to that so do you guys agree that there's a crisis of masculinity yes

(2:14:14) oh you seem not to think so do you don't think that there's too many weak men in the world or there's a decline of

(2:14:19) healthy masculinity I think there's too many I mean it depends on what you think weak is I mean I've been in I've been in

(2:14:25) the strip club industry before I mean come on we know what week is I don't think you're weak for for having a

(2:14:33) fantasy and and being and somebody being able to provide that for you I don't think you're a weak person for having a

(2:14:39) fantasy what do you I what do you I don't know what you're talking about like I don't think do you think men today are weaker or stronger than 100

(2:14:46) years ago on average oh I think everybody is weaker I think everybody's weaker yeah

(2:14:52) everyone's way too sensitive now everything's so sensitive everything way too far yeah and they can't just to my

(2:14:59) opinion if it does not affect you why the [ __ ] do you care exactly so let's

(2:15:04) let's let's let's zoom out a second I think I would say one of the things that's making men weaker is the

(2:15:11) addiction to sex well not sex the addiction to pornography that many have nowadays would you guys say that that's

(2:15:17) accurate yes yes yes yes yes yes L seems not to think so do you think so do you think addiction to pornography

(2:15:23) makes a man weaker me I'm sorry I don't I don't think you're weak daddy

(2:15:30) if you like porn I'm just gonna say that like that because of course she's got a conflict of interest here financially

(2:15:35) hey Elle since we're talking since we have your attention um can you use I don't know if you see your angle here can you scoot Kiki like

(2:15:43) into frame because she's like kind of like been you're gonna have to use your muscles

(2:15:49) though she's so if you push her yeah oh perfect wait too much wait back

(2:15:55) back just yep push myself but you got

(2:16:00) now you gotta scoot back into your spot okay and then they're you right there scoot that way can you scoot that way

(2:16:07) you can yeah that one oh okay and then screw your mic along with you if you can all right cool okay I finished the point

(2:16:13) that I was getting to go ahead and then I have a follow-up Point okay keep grabbing it yeah do you guys think

() 

(2:16:21) it would be better for the world if there were more strong men yes yes yes yeah because okay I personally

(2:16:29) like I just want to like surf like I'm very submissive to men so if I had a

(2:16:35) strong man like who like like not like how they are now but like a masculine

(2:16:41) man who would provide and like make the money I would stay home cook clean do everything like raise the kids like

(2:16:47) everything for him like he would come he would leave with like breakfast he would

(2:16:52) go to work with lunch and come home to dinner and like whatever else he needed but like men aren't like that today

(2:17:00) foreign [Music] [Applause]

(2:17:19) I think there are men like there certainly are and but there's also

(2:17:24) a huge decline of them there is a huge but there is and I think it's because of

(2:17:29) something in addition to what you guys are saying which is of masculinity there's a crisis of femininity and it

(2:17:36) takes both of us before we get to that the point that I'm trying to make so you think what did you say a moment

(2:17:42) ago you think that there needs to be more of them what did you say just two seconds ago that there's a decline in it there's a decline in it

(2:17:50) do we think that by increasing the amount of pornography that is available

(2:17:55) on the internet we are potentially contributing to the decline of masculinity yes yes that's one yes

(2:18:02) that's two yeses what do you think yes yes and here's why because men being

(2:18:07) able to purchase a girl on only fans is really not like

(2:18:12) empowering the women because it's saying hey you can just buy a picture of my titties online for 10.99 a month and

(2:18:21) that to me is like yeah it's it's the opposite of like feminist and

(2:18:27) empowerment it's like hey a guy can purchase my boobs for 10 bucks like these are Priceless like he you know

(2:18:33) what I'm saying so like I think it's really hurting like I think I think telling women that it

(2:18:40) was empowering to sell their bodies online for 10 bucks a month is one of the most hilarious games

(2:18:48) Alfred Kinsey guy and Hugh Hefner said that he wanted to be the pamphleteer of

(2:18:55) the sexual Revolution like he wanted to be the one to trick women into being played by bunnies and think they're

(2:19:00) empowered by being played by bunnies when really he had the last laugh yeah and I think that you know we as women

(2:19:06) deserve better and I think deep down men want to be better so it's like who's going to be better

(2:19:12) it's difficult for a lot of men to become better when they are enticed in all directions by pornographic content

(2:19:19) right it's very difficult for a man we are sexual beings and like the male sex

(2:19:25) drive it's freaking high and when you're saturated from all directions with sexual content it's hard to pull your

(2:19:30) mind out of it as a man and back to the whole empowering thing the only things is pretty just my entire income and I do

(2:19:36) not feel empowered by it at all no I don't think I feel completely degraded most of the time I don't think you do

(2:19:41) speaking to these people but the thing is I already knew that going into it I decided to make a [ __ ] bag and get

(2:19:47) the plan for the rest of my life laid out but I respect so many glitter finish I respect you just that I knew it was

(2:19:52) degrading from the beginning but it's like oh you know what I'm going into this I have a plan and you just own it if you could do it over again and make

(2:19:59) money a different way would you if you had an opportunity to make money a different way would you do it over again I think yes and no

(2:20:06) um I first started right out of high school I was 18 I was in college for two weeks and I said absolutely not I'm

(2:20:12) going out to LA and so I think yes and no because at the same time like I am making a lot more money now than I would

(2:20:19) at many other jobs how much do you make monthly uh you could ballpark it I mean about

(2:20:26) seventy thousand dollars a month yeah and that's not even like a lot compared to some of these girls not only fans but

() 

(2:20:32) I feel like I'm also doing it much smarter than a lot of these girls not only fans are because I invest so much

(2:20:37) of it do you know what percentile you're in on of I am in the top point zero nine

(2:20:43) percent uh wait just really quick you do you do only pins you do only fans anybody else who do only fans

(2:20:49) just you three correct no hidden off Justin

(2:20:54) Jay Waller 69 only fans you're very smart no I I I'm not judging you

(2:21:00) onlyfans.com whatever he's on there um just really quick on money so you said

(2:21:07) you make 70 000 a month how much do you make between thirty thousand and a hundred thousand a month wow wow okay

(2:21:12) and how much do you make per month um I started okay I just started but I

(2:21:18) average about six thousand that's about it impressive that's with like no following and so to

(2:21:26) to drive the point home uh we're talking about the crisis of masculinity we'll talk about the fact

(2:21:31) that there's not enough real men in the world there's so I've heard from literally thousands of women in the past several months that have been like man I

(2:21:37) wish that there were more real men out there I think a lot of dudes are having their their real their life force sapped

(2:21:43) from their bodies from all this pornography out there and we've talked throughout this conversation about this idea that hey I have I have my morality

(2:21:49) as long as it's not hurting anybody what's the big deal right

(2:21:55) what I want to know is do we think it is responsible if we're trying to create a healthy Society to increase the amount

(2:22:01) of pornography that's available to men if we want to see the masculinity crisis fixed is it a good idea to continue

(2:22:07) contributing to it with more pornography I have a I have a follow-up question for you

(2:22:13) drive away from what you have fast but do you think if all the top let's say 25

(2:22:19) even 50 or 100 top creators took took their platform off of only fans do you

(2:22:24) not think that men would still find another girl to go subscribe to and get the same content or go on PornHub and do

(2:22:30) the same thing also to counteract that do you think that the men that are on of

(2:22:36) it's It's primarily men the people that go in strip clubs primarily men you

(2:22:41) can't be mad at a woman for making her bag win you're the reason that there is a bag there to begin with here's the

(2:22:47) question here's the question I have how many married men do you guys have subscribing to you about 40 percent

() 

(2:22:54) probably probably one of those have their wife in their profile picture with them yeah that's bizarre some of them

(2:23:00) fantasies about you being in the you like fantasies about like their wife finding out or something like couples I

(2:23:07) suppose to subscribe you know they watch my content together and it brings them closer together I love it but here's the thing though I bet that's such a small

(2:23:13) percentage I bet a lot of husbands their wife don't know and if their wives did find out

(2:23:18) that she had to get off only fans because his fiance found out and was

(2:23:23) like either we're done or you get off only pants I had I had a guy sorry I'm sorry I had a guy or a woman messaged me

(2:23:30) last week she said my I just found out that my husband has spent thirty thousand dollars on an only Fan's hoe

(2:23:36) what should I do about this should I divorce him in my opinion yeah in my

(2:23:42) opinion if a woman was in that kind of situation she should leave him so so here I'm curious for you too if you guys

(2:23:47) got married and you found out that your husbands were spending tens of thousands of dollars on other women's pornographic

(2:23:52) content how would that make you feel that's hard to say I feel like just

(2:23:58) because like obviously being in this industry it's like me and him both do only fans we both make content and so

(2:24:05) it's like and obviously I mean they're gonna watch you guys are gonna watch porn either way I personally don't put

(2:24:11) that on me I'm not going to okay but Jordy 95 of men are going to be watching porn

(2:24:21) unless you're unless you're asexual or celibate the people that subscribe to him are probably men as well it is about

(2:24:28) I I used yeah it's a high percentage 90 gay men and about 10 women right yeah so

() 

(2:24:36) the problem so the problem with this is is this why men should take responsibility men have always led the world listen let's not act like that's

(2:24:42) not the case we invent build and maintain Society the fact that despite how beautiful you are you're stunning

(2:24:47) the fact that you can make more money than the [ __ ] that paved the road for me to get here is a joke yep

(2:24:53) it's a [ __ ] joke and it's broken now that's not disrespect to you but one thing I will say about Dubai if you don't bring Dubai back up is that you

(2:24:59) can't do that [ __ ] in Dubai yeah okay no you no you can't you can't even get on a porn site to buy if you wanted to and I

(2:25:06) one thing I think in Dubai you just can't do it no no no no they they they take it away

(2:25:13) and for that I will say when I'm in Dubai not only is it safer but you see more families in Dubai you see more you

(2:25:19) see kids you see things like this it's a beautiful thing and you know I'm all about people having their free rights

(2:25:25) and everything but I do think Dubai gets that right because if America doesn't do something to save the men so men can be good enough to get good beautiful women

(2:25:32) like you ladies then we are always going to have this problem regardless of religion this is why we should ban porn

(2:25:37) in America I'm about it I'm through it look look if we agree on anything I'm about I'm all about banning porn

(2:25:45) because what's happening it's so funny how the women are more upset about it than the guys right now oh no wait look

(2:25:50) look the point is this what's happening I

(2:25:56) go ahead one quick thing is um perhaps the women at this table haven't been hurt by a man cheating on

(2:26:03) them or a boyfriend or something cheating on them and looking at porn or cheating with another person but I know people that have been hurt and probably

(2:26:09) we know people who have been hurt exactly so and that's

(2:26:17) the others how you'd want right and so I think that's really you mentioned a crisis of masculinity I

(2:26:23) think there's a crisis of femininity too because you know we set the standard as women right like that's part of our role

(2:26:29) in society of saying like we're going to have boundaries we're going to have standards for the men and that they need

(2:26:35) to rise to the occasion for us but I would argue there's just as many male feminists as are all women yes those

(2:26:40) [ __ ] [ __ ] are the ones that's messing everything young beautiful girl would be much happier if there's a man

(2:26:46) that you could be inside of his frame and not be talking to weirdos on the internet I know you make a lot of money and and I don't blame you for doing it

(2:26:51) 70 grand a month that's good money but ideally for you if there was a man that

(2:26:57) you could look up to admire want to be inside that frame and you who knew he had everything taken care of completely you would put it down and and it's not

(2:27:04) anybody's fault but weak men that a young lady like this is having to do something like that because there's no man around that she can identify how

(2:27:10) many men are providers and we are the caretakers and I because of how again

(2:27:16) you guys were saying a weak men for that reason I was raised where you rely on anybody you get your bag by yourself and

(2:27:23) that's for that reason my household was very traditional yet we were still raised because of how the world was

(2:27:28) turning that you provide for yourself and you rely on absolutely nobody I just want to say I think you're really smart

(2:27:34) for like investing and not like blowing your only fans money on like flexing like you know like Hermes bags and like

(2:27:41) stupid stuff so like thank you I want to say that one question for you one question for you um Okay so

(2:27:47) can I say something Brian really quick super quick for Kirsten okay super quick um I believe that you're very smart that

(2:27:54) you're very beautiful you're very talented and I think you could make a boatload of money not doing only fans and I think eventually maybe not 70k.com

(2:28:02) but also like I am extremely business-minded where it's like I'm making all this money now that I can

(2:28:08) invest into all these businesses and I don't have to worry about taking loans I don't have to take money from other people I'm able to make all this money

(2:28:15) myself and make all these businesses that I don't have to I don't have to work when I'm are you doing that right

(2:28:20) now that's what I'm working towards yeah Investments businesses all kinds of what kind of businesses you want to uh the

(2:28:25) current one I'm working on is a women's only gym that is that's so basically they're not super based yeah is it

(2:28:33) though yeah dude I think we should have men's only gyms and women yeah I was about to say like gender

(2:28:39) issues yeah and so you can't you can't do that that's a huge reality thing but we're able to work around with the

() 

(2:28:45) lawyer that I'm speaking to which I can't really talk too much more honor well I I should I mean there's something in California called the unrue it's

(2:28:52) Unruh I believe the Unruh I don't know exactly what it's called but uh

(2:28:57) California has really strong anti-discrimination laws yes so like for example in California you can't

(2:29:04) do a ladies night at a bar so ridiculous no well I'm I'm in favor of it the

(2:29:09) feminist look the status quo feminists asked for it you're gonna get equality you ask for

(2:29:15) equality that was the original feminism though no well feminism has always been a man-hating ideology but that's another

(2:29:20) conversation no feminism's always just been like a women's Supremacy mandating

(2:29:26) ideology but many today for sure though well I mean if you go back to like

(2:29:32) Seneca Falls it was basically it was uh the OG feminists were also deeply racist

(2:29:37) too but that's that's a whole nother uh conversation so um I I commend you on

(2:29:42) that I personally want to see female-only gyms and Men men's only gyms and I want to see dude only gyms where they're playing like death metal inside

(2:29:48) and yeah big screen but that's how it was and then peanut butter and jelly sandwiches

(2:29:54) are those death metal bands no it's just the one chalk everywhere yes yes eating PB and J so you get gain weight yes dude

(2:30:02) that's how it used to be there used to be like gentlemen's clubs and there used to be uh bars and establishments that

(2:30:07) were for men only however it was a real country however the feminists came in and said this is discrimination and so

(2:30:16) this is what you ask for you want women only gyms too bad bro I don't ask for it you get it I don't want chicks with

(2:30:22) spandex all the way inside their intestines doing squats around me while I'm working out fair enough like get that out of my face dude fair enough so

(2:30:28) I had the question for you kind of like I was just curious can you show us your tattoo the one right here

(2:30:34) it says Eternal Eternal but why is it backwards yeah why is it backwards

(2:30:40) when I look out in the mirror it says Eternal what inspired you to get that um because obviously we do not live

(2:30:46) forever but I want the Legacy I live while I'm living to be Eternal you know you can live forever

(2:30:52) yeah yeah yeah there's a man named Jesus Christ and it's real

(2:30:58) I had no idea Chase was so religious Chase is a deeply religious I had no

(2:31:03) idea you said you had no idea what I had no clue you were so religious yeah bro yeah Jesus is the real deal man are you uh

(2:31:10) you know what you're you're close with the Tates Chase is like on a crusade to

(2:31:16) to bring Andrew back to Christianity Christianity yes oh instead of Islam

(2:31:23) yeah that's what well that's what Chase told me right yes yes I wanna I wanna

(2:31:28) bring Tate to the truth man oh man that's a conversation for you and Taylor Cowboy I think the Eternal thing is

(2:31:33) really beautiful because we were all made I think for eternity we're like have this insuppressible desire to live

(2:31:39) forever and to have that Legacy and that is one of the reasons I became Catholic was because I discovered that you can

(2:31:46) like Chase was saying no absolutely I understand all that I was raised in a very strict Christian household and so I

(2:31:52) understand all of that I was just more curious because I know this backwards I was like it's backwards so I was like so

(2:31:58) I can see it in the mirror do you think can you show it to the camera one more time just do you think

(2:32:06) do you think this thickness of the Christian home that you grew up in made you like have an aversion to it

(2:32:13) um honestly no I like I said I from the time I was born I was raised very

(2:32:19) Christian I started having an issue with it I um my senior year of high school I had Lyme disease and I was really I

(2:32:25) currently have Lyme disease yeah it took them nine months to diagnose me um I didn't leave my house for nine

(2:32:31) months all kinds of things and you said you got bit by a tick yeah yeah and I didn't even know um that I'd been bitten

(2:32:38) by a tick but when I had that it was like I was still very connected to God at that point and it was like after praying for nine months every single

(2:32:45) night it's like you almost give up and it's very hard to find your way back from when it took three years to get

(2:32:51) over I've had it for 28 years I got it for my

(2:32:58) mother she took her own life from it when I was in high school and that actually made me an atheist for years yeah yeah yeah do you still have it no

(2:33:05) actually I found a holistic doctor out of Indiana a couple hours out of where I live and she was able to get rid of it

(2:33:11) for me it took like six eight months but I officially like you can test my blood

(2:33:17) and it'll come back Lyme disease free wow congratulations congrats that's more about it after the show that's something

(2:33:23) chase that you've struggled with for your whole life so yeah yeah to be honest my relationship with Jesus is the

(2:33:29) only reason I'm still here because I've I've dealt with that hopelessness a lot yeah that's it started all of my mental

(2:33:35) issues whether it's pressure and anxiety everything it was just from there it just all went downhill so yeah um I'm

(2:33:42) glad that you're healed from it thank you by the way there's uh there's currently uh we got still ten thousand five oh what

(2:33:50) the [ __ ] why did I did I I don't know has that been going on the entire time sorry I didn't mean to send the missile

(2:33:56) there I don't know why but okay there's 10 500 people watching the chat is on

(2:34:02) fire that's crazy thank you everybody you guys drop a like on the video um drop a like there's ten thousand of

(2:34:07) you in here but let's get to uh four thousand five thousand if we can do you mind if I bring something up in regards

(2:34:13) to you switching Tate over I think your best bet is to start with getting Christianity to actually stand behind

(2:34:19) the religion yes these gay flags in front of churches not that I'm against gays but that's not with the religion

(2:34:25) yep the things that the Christianity is allowing is making Christianity lose in

(2:34:30) a lot of ways to Islam and I think that's the basis right now for Christianity to return is to get back to

(2:34:36) the backbone in the actual religion and not being socially correct with people you and I are a hundred percent on the

(2:34:43) same page bro absolutely one of the phenomenons I'm sorry I got to say this one of the phenomenons that is driving

(2:34:49) so many people towards Islam right now is Christianity a week yeah dude bro you you look you

(2:34:55) you go on Twitter they've got trans people literally dancing inside of churches across the West what is that

(2:35:02) it's a huge departure from the word of God and it's it's really fascinating to watch too because so many young dudes

(2:35:08) watch Tate and they look up to Tate and they see Tate saying hey Islam is more based than Christianity is and so

(2:35:14) they're following Tate into Islam my problem with it is because when you when you object I believe when you

(2:35:20) objectively pursue truth you end up at Jesus and a lot of these people they're looking at Islam not as what is the most

(2:35:26) True Religion but what is the most based religion I believe Christianity well it's like what religion do they respect

(2:35:32) the most and that's the problem it's hard to respect Christianity when they're obviously selling out to agendas

(2:35:38) yes I think which is why we need the 21st century Crusade let's go Dave's Vault but hold on are you are you

(2:35:43) Catholic Chase no okay so why not um I mean you really want to get into it

(2:35:48) kind of I mean it's important it's an Andrew take question too because I think if you're if what you're describing is

(2:35:54) true it's like he has an aversion to the immoral issues that the church seems to be accepting immorality into the church

(2:36:00) I have other challenge issues well not even that is not immorality I don't think I'm here to judge of somebody

(2:36:06) else's life what it is is judging the fact that we know that Christianity is getting away from the Baseline rules that they have so you can't respect them

(2:36:12) because they don't keep their word right and I think one of the reasons so in 1500 right the church split and you had

(2:36:19) the reformation and then you had now we have 50 000 denominations alongside the Catholic Church of different churches

(2:36:25) that have different moral beliefs and then you have the rainbow Flags outside of some of them you have the different

(2:36:30) um they're changing the rules about contraception about sex about marriage and that's one of the things that made me want to become Catholic was learning

(2:36:37) that they didn't change their moral teaching for a 2000 years that it's been consistent and cohesive I disagree with

(2:36:43) the consistency and that's why I'm not part of the Catholic church you've got you've got Pope Francis bringing uh deities into the Vatican worshiping

(2:36:50) pachamama in front of uh inside Saint Peter's Basilica and I believe it's the second commandment that says you shall

(2:36:56) have no other gods before me like bro I see Catholicism sorry to call you bro I see Catholicism compromise on so many

(2:37:02) things like this and it's just well let's talk about pachamama for a minute because I don't think to be honest out of respect for Brian I don't think we

(2:37:08) should do that thank you another time um okay let's uh I need to uh do a couple

(2:42:19) deeply religious and Christian culture uh let me just I'll come in here really quick uh do uh I'm deeply appreciative

(2:42:25) of the 100 uh Super Chat however this is not a topic I feel particularly inclined

(2:42:30) to engage in uh on the show just we're not we're on YouTube like I'm not we're

(2:42:36) not going to talk about Brian if I may make a point staying safe with YouTube's TOs

(2:42:42) he raises a good point because all of this like post-modernist I can make my

(2:42:49) own morality whatever I want you know as long as it doesn't hurt anybody and everything's consensual then it's fine

(2:42:55) that is exactly where all of this is going it already has I mean that would hurt we're not going to talk about it to

(2:43:01) respect what Brian wants to do but the pornography crisis is definitely hurting children in a big big way

(2:43:07) pornography usage is increasing and it's hurting kids also Chase are you kind of also referring to like this this shift

(2:43:14) to like maps and Andrew Tate's talked about this Maps yup Maps yep they call them minor attracted persons that's this

(2:43:20) is they're moving towards the legalization of that kind of stuff okay we have hide that Eric

(2:43:26) um we have uh oops hold on [ __ ] Dapper Dave thing for the 100 man for Chase going to your points about Christianity

(2:43:33) losing out to other religions because of giving to the woke agenda not properly defending themselves what is your

(2:43:39) definition of turn the other cheek also Christians giving into toxic femininity

(2:43:45) so what's your definition of turn the other cheek yeah so like if somebody's an [ __ ] to me I'm not going to be an

(2:43:51) [ __ ] to them back right so like I've had plenty of people attack me and I don't just like go and go for their

(2:43:57) jugular and try and attack them back to hurt them that's my definition of turning the other cheek yeah but you

(2:44:02) should never lower your you should never lower your standards to fit somebody else's reality just because you should

(2:44:07) never lower your standards to fit somebody else's reality just because they have to act that way does not mean that you have to retaliate in that way

(2:44:13) right right yeah but to be clear point of not turning the other cheek go ahead to be clear and correct me if I'm wrong

(2:44:18) Jesus was a Savage when he had to be oh yeah he wasn't a punk he wasn't a pushover he wasn't just like he was slit

(2:44:25) a throw too yeah and so I think I think that the church particularly the Christian Church gets that part wrong they need to bring that Sabbath side out

(2:44:31) and Republicans for that matter you know Senator apart I think the key is like what are you defending right I mean turn

(2:44:38) the other cheek is you're turning the other cheek and you're willing to take an insult but right but when it comes to

(2:44:43) defending your children and your family in the future of society there's no turn the other cheek then so

(2:44:49) I think that like we were talking about earlier I think that they're missing that Savage side of Jesus or

(2:44:54) Christianity as a whole what I and what I would say to that Justin is there has been an intentional agenda to neuter and

(2:45:02) castrate Christianity because they know if they can present Jesus as this hippie who just says oh yeah just be nice to

(2:45:08) everybody I'm a socialist that's how Jesus is presented to a lot of of young people nowadays they know that you know

(2:45:13) that the the the Christian ethos that has kept the West together for the past 2000 years is going to fall apart which

(2:45:19) is what we're seeing we wouldn't want a toxic Jesus would we no you know the the true Jesus is the man who's flipping

(2:45:25) tables and chasing the money changers out of the temple with whips right he's coming back and he's he's slaughtering

(2:45:31) the Antichrist in all of his armies right his father is Yahweh who is it

(2:45:36) says in Exodus he is a god of war and you look all throughout the Old Testament God would frequently have his

(2:45:41) people just wreck other tribes right that is who God is and it's not it's not for the purpose of just violence for

(2:45:47) violence's sake but oftentimes it was for the purpose of fighting evil right in the Catholic church in the in the

(2:45:53) Medieval ages they had Knights whose purpose was to defend the church right the the true church has backbone but

(2:45:59) it's been subverted and that's why we're in the position but I think the most beautiful example of sacrificial

(2:46:04) masculinity is Jesus Christ on the cross actually which is kind of this contradiction right Jesus is literally giving his life for other people and

(2:46:10) taking every out of love out of love to for the savings not because he was a [ __ ] it was out of love absolutely

(2:46:17) absolutely but I think that when you're so strong that you're willing to die for

(2:46:22) somebody else right that is the ultimate love right there yes and there are

(2:46:27) amazing like Saints in the Christian tradition that literally die for transcendentals for moral truths for

(2:46:34) love almost all of Christ's disciples were brutally murdered because of their faith but to Justin back to your point

(2:46:41) when you really look at Jesus Christ's character he was in my opinion the most masculine man who ever lived he he bore

(2:46:47) the weight of the cross out of love for other people right he sacrificed his own life out of love and on top of that this

(2:46:54) was a man who had so much courage so much vitality and masculinity he would

(2:46:59) stand in front of people who hated him and were plotting to kill him and he would still speak the truth directly to

(2:47:05) their faces and and then they eventually killed him for it what is more masculine than a man who's willing to die for his

(2:47:12) ideals and isn't isn't so much of a [ __ ] that he'll cower away from death but he leans into it right that's so

(2:47:18) masculine he didn't wage war though he didn't go on a slaughtering Rampage he laid down his life out of love he did

(2:47:24) but he will be Waging War when he comes back so this is different when you're saying like yeah we're gonna rate like that's what we need to do and it's like

(2:47:29) but his very definition and demonstration was sacrificing himself out of love he sacrificed himself out of

(2:47:35) love but he also stood up for Truth All right but uh Justin one thing you said last

(2:47:40) show that that was really interesting and I think you just mentioned something about cutting throats yeah um you said

(2:47:45) what was it like a definition of a man is someone that can slit a throat and hold a baby in the same day I love that

(2:47:52) yeah I don't know I don't know you have to split a throat to be a man but I think I think if it's necessary that

(2:47:58) polarity is necessary then yes yeah I think that they're saying that's what Christianity is missing capable of being

(2:48:04) dangerous yeah but also ultimately I guess I guess I would just push back a

(2:48:10) little bit because because I think where your guys are going I like where you're going in terms of I think the motivation which is you want strong men to defend

(2:48:16) civilization right but I think maybe what you're popping up here with I don't know your whole mentality on this but

(2:48:22) you don't have to be violent commit silence to being masculine right no you

(2:48:28) don't but I think you certainly need to be capable capable when the time comes and that's of course that's the point I'm making is that whether whether

(2:48:35) Christianity needs to be violent or not I think it does is not a consideration it doesn't but I do think I'm not I want

(2:48:41) to make it clear I'm not yeah I don't either but it also needs to stand up for what its actual values have been and what's in the book because right now I

(2:48:47) think they're drastically failing at that and you can see the numbers in churches going down like comparatively

(2:48:53) to the last couple of decades it's not doing well in comparison yeah um okay let's oh sorry go ahead no

(2:48:59) I was gonna say as Islam kind of is and I'm not even look I'm American the Christianity is American I grew up

(2:49:05) around Christianity I want to see Christianity win right let's go a super chat I think about the Virgin Mary did

(2:49:10) you see that if it wasn't over the threshold we're okay enough money

(2:49:16) all right we have uh Slow Joe 69 thank you man for the uh 101.69 in the next

(2:49:22) three to five years every single image in social media will be generated by AI it will be impossible to tell fake from

(2:49:28) reality I hope the 305s learn to code Brian you're a king Chaser awesome Madison and Gisele hope you're invited

(2:49:35) back hey thank you uh so much for the kind word Slow Joe 69 thank you for the additional 69 cents

(2:49:41) they're much appreciated all right we have a couple more soup chats here did we do this one yeah we did we have a Bob

(2:49:48) money210 thank you man really appreciate it brown with four million in Subs oh we did this one right we read it yeah uh

(2:49:54) free fall uh thank you for the hundred man Chase uh Giselle can you read this

(2:49:59) Chase and Brian I am a fan and ladies I just want to say as a female who is in

(2:50:04) her 20s it's so hard especially in Cali to find a good guy because I get made fun of uh for having barely any

(2:50:11) experience and them just wanting to get off on only fans I'm always compared to ladies like you hold on if they're

(2:50:17) making fun of you for that they're not a good guy and you shouldn't want to date him anyways yeah yeah so you don't want

(2:50:23) a guy on only fans you don't want to date a guy you get so you get made fun of for barely having any experience I think

(2:50:30) that's most men find that a desirable trait she's I mean she's probably getting

(2:50:36) shamed for not putting out I would imagine and Free Fall what I would say to that is don't compromise your

(2:50:42) standards there's plenty of guys out there who would really value you being a chased woman that's the problem with

(2:50:47) today's generation girls don't have Role Models anymore to look up into the mic I'm so sorry

(2:50:53) um I'm 23 you know you guys are young too I had an early

(2:50:59) fans account a couple years ago so try to just

(2:51:04) straight into the mic just um lock in I just feel like modern women today are

(2:51:11) just not as good as they were back then base you gotta make women great again

(2:51:16) yeah I mean look at no

(2:51:25) over here she's I feel bad for her you know because she's probably you know just wanting to

(2:51:33) find a real guy who's not willing to spend money on other girls and if all

(2:51:38) these men are just you know buying only fans and he's not a real guy like but I I feel bad because our society it's so

(2:51:45) cornified even before only fans it was pornified you know like with the Kardashians are presenting out into society and with just this idea that as

(2:51:53) women we do have to put out or we have to dress really sexually to get attention and to get affirmation so I think and a lot of girls are I think our

(2:52:00) victims become victims of sexual assault at Young ages today so there's a lot of crap that young girls have to deal with

(2:52:07) and so it's hard for you out there you know I I my heart goes out to every

(2:52:12) young girl and that's where but I my my messages listen you have it within yourself to rise above and you deserve

(2:52:20) better you are better and there's a beautiful future for every single woman no matter what her past was that can

(2:52:26) lead she can believe that in the past get some help uh Free Fall by the way I mean I I would assume it's mostly women

(2:52:33) that are shaming you for barely having any experience because no dudes are going to be like right it is I

(2:52:39) personally like with my values and my morals I tell guys when they're interested in me I'm like I'm sorry I

(2:52:45) cannot have sex with you until we're in a committed relationship and I get bashed by so many men and so many men

(2:52:52) mistreat me after I tell them that I won't do that they'll yell at me they'll tell me I'm manipulative they'll tell me

(2:52:58) that I led them on or anything like that just because I won't put out for them earlier than them committing to well

(2:53:04) that's them just trying to pressure you into having sex but that's wrong and don't give in to it don't never do and I

(2:53:10) commend you for not giving in a good job yeah but there's there's tons of men out there that don't want hoes of course

(2:53:19) are you saving yourself for a committed boyfriend or for marriage or committed relationship yes I want that

(2:53:25) relationship to lead to marriage yes but I I'm not too I've never delve into

(2:53:30) religion too much so that's okay I haven't um done the whole wait till marriage

(2:53:35) thing but yeah I want a committed relationship that leads to yes you want to become a mom

(2:53:41) I that's something that I think

(2:53:47) [Music] see that question you got a little Sparkle in your eye I think Giselle wants to be a mom I'm very

(2:53:54) caring I'm very loving I definitely want to help a lot of foster children around the world that's like one of my Big

(2:54:01) Dreams yeah yes I agree it was beautiful thank you all right we have uh Sloan

(2:54:06) Fidel oh we did I believe we read that one yep Sloan thank you appreciate it we have Rodriguez

(2:54:13) Rodrigo De la Rosa chase the idea that the true church the Catholic Church must

(2:54:18) always be composed by pure Angels is a human very human idea and at the same time an anti-biblical very anti-biblical

(2:54:24) one your response yeah I mean I I recognize that I recognize that all churches have people that are imperfect

(2:54:29) she just asked why I'm not part of the Catholic church and there's I have a lot of different reasons well you talked about the pope and there have been some

(2:54:35) really bad popes but what the popes have never done is change the church's teaching to be bad so even Pope Francis

(2:54:41) if you mess up or does something bad he's not changing the church's teaching and there have been popes that have been actually taken out like they've died

(2:54:48) mysteriously and some people theorize well did God you know let them be taken out because they were leading the church

(2:54:54) in a bad Direction so God the Gates of Hell will not Prevail that's what God promises on Saint Peter he builds a

(2:55:00) church and then we do have Catholic churches that are

(2:55:05) get some condoning lgbtq stuff all right crazy crazy thank you for the 100 Jesus said pick up

(2:55:11) your cross and follow him Jesus Christ never started a religion

(2:55:17) such cap bro he literally promised eternal life if you believe in him and like his disciples spread the religion

(2:55:23) across the world of course he started a religion crazy thing for the 100 donation Super Chat thank you uh Milky

(2:55:29) Way Moses think for the hundred Gisele go for it

(2:55:37) very very hard

(2:55:43) to have a lot of concerns about Justin's hypothetical daughters what does she think about a gay couple raising

(2:55:50) daughters versus a straight couple does she ask gay couples this many questions when she meets them as long as she

(2:55:57) thinks she's smart but not I I think that children deserve a mother and a father amen I agree

(2:56:03) same I think children deserve loving caring parents or Guardians

(2:56:10) because I was raised by a single mother and I am honestly I couldn't see myself

(2:56:16) as any better off and you guys can think what you want because of my career but just as much as Kirsten I also like

(2:56:23) invest my money I when I started stripping every dollar I made went into buying a [ __ ] house and then flipping

(2:56:28) it so did you do it yeah I did that at 19. you said you said you couldn't see

(2:56:34) yourself having been any better off had you not had a father I mean I'm saying

(2:56:39) if I had two loving parents it doesn't matter like I you you you you can have

(2:56:45) an amazing home life and choose the same path and I [ __ ] with that Winners win despite childhood yeah I had a shitty

(2:56:51) childhood of bringing I'm still going to win it doesn't matter winners amen you you can have the same exact trauma as

(2:56:58) somebody else and choose not to let it be a crutch to why you don't do good things I super support that message

(2:57:03) because there's a lot of kids growing up in single family households and I'd never want them children to believe that they couldn't go be somebody if they put

(2:57:09) their minds yeah like maybe I might not have jumped on a Super Bowl as quickly but like yeah like look yeah you know I

(2:57:15) came from a very well-off home I came from Two Loving parents and I picked the same career path you did and I grew up

(2:57:20) in it I was I was lucky to have a very happy home exactly right and now we have a happy home together oh okay I love it

(2:57:28) all right we have uh this one we're in the midst of reading it I'll just continue it and it still affects my mind

(2:57:34) to this day uh prawn separates you from physical s from what it truly is soul

(2:57:40) connection I've experienced more of the physical but the few passionate times stay in my heart

(2:57:47) word Milky Way Moses so sad that's what's happening right now I mean

(2:57:54) it's kind of Simply a few passionate times stay on my heart that's a grown man that just said that but he's I mean

(2:58:05) the first part's pretty horrible though that's a lot of kids are are running into that because of the proliferation

(2:58:11) of porn so yeah but I can't believe you saw it when he was three like there was new magazines and DVDs and [ __ ] in our

(2:58:18) parents everywhere now I get it I get it but like even we had internet at like 16 17

(2:58:25) like the the real problem with porn is that there's no motivation to go like you said there's no motivation to go out

(2:58:31) and get in the real world and I think when that drug is easier than working hard enough and being scared of the rejection is having to do all the work

(2:58:37) that's what the problem with porn is it's it's stopping guys it's stopping guys from being hungry enough to go seek

(2:58:43) the actual facts which it is sleeping with the beautiful girl not not Jack after the image and only fans even made

(2:58:50) it to where you can text into the mic and have it right but in all fairness but in all fairness a smart girl is

(2:58:56) going to have somebody else text for I mean I'm sure that it's hard for you to text to everybody no she texts all her

(2:59:03) people okay yeah they have like 50 people yeah yeah but but otherwise

(2:59:10) you know somebody else will be doing it for her so is that how many subscribers you have 50 000 yes for 70k a month

(2:59:18) recharging them like a dollar fifty no no it's a free page I make all my money through my messages and post

(2:59:24) mine's a free page as well learn from her to do that all right okay bro so a lot of these

(2:59:30) Bros that are talking to models on only fans are probably talking to dude dudes man it is over

(2:59:36) yep well I mean wasn't I'm pretty sure like Tate when he had his campsites he I

(2:59:42) mean him and his brothers were they were the ones telling them yo give me your life savings yeah

(2:59:48) uh well Haram uh let's see here we have uh Lucia

(2:59:57) Christie thanks for the uh

(3:00:02) I didn't see the I I wasn't looking at the country chick said the Catholic religion is satanic it goes all the way

(3:00:08) back to Babylon religion that Nimrod started in the Old Testament the Catholics were torturing Bible Believers

(3:00:13) in the New Testament Fox's book of Martyrs PS highly recommend something Dr Ruckman

(3:00:20) commentary okay uh country chick thank you uh inaccurate I mean I don't understand how

(3:00:27) the Catholic Church could be torturing people in the New Testament that doesn't make sense all right we have uh Lucia here thank you for the uh

(3:00:35) six yo where did the girl is

(3:00:42) all right I'll carry it Brian Q I am not a fan of makeup since I find it creepy

(3:00:48) especially fake eyelashes and so on but my friends have been convincing me to wear makeup because it's appealing to

(3:00:53) men is it true because now I don't feel confident about myself Chase thanks for spreading God's word you're welcome

(3:01:00) Lucia be you like do you be you you're gonna attract a person's attract

(3:01:14) you know special occasions but typically men like more natural looks yeah Lucia I'll speak I'll speak from personal

(3:01:20) experience I don't know what Justin's opinion is I find natural beauty extremely attractive uh I I think fake eyelashes look

(3:01:27) ridiculous I don't think it's attractive at all what do you think Justin I think natural beauty is incredible if you have

(3:01:33) to do something yeah you know maximize it you look so much better without your makeup yeah and and this is coming from

(3:01:40) this is coming from somebody that pursued the makeup industry and I can tell you right now I know for a fact

(3:01:46) whenever I would work at a strip club or take pictures on my of I would always go a more natural route because it there it

(3:01:53) looks like over compensation and for me even even going from um the Midwest in like Ohio and then

(3:02:00) going to Los Angeles California there's a there's a higher there's a higher par like I could be uh I could be a 10 in

(3:02:08) Ohio and be a three here and and that that's not me degrading myself as a woman that's just me recognizing that

(3:02:15) the value of women here is at a different standard than where I'm from because there's more resources for that sort of thing and I personally and I I

(3:02:24) want everyone woman to to do whatever makes them feel the best version of

(3:02:29) themselves so if you if you want to you know get enhancements or get like this

(3:02:35) is not my real hair I really didn't admit that but like

(3:02:42) yes to all of that do you be you yeah do you guys sit down whatever you're comfortable with you know

(3:02:48) it's giving me anxiety when people stand up around me you going to the bathroom Chaser okay

(3:02:56) trying to get down to the bottom of what's going on okay um where were we I don't I don't know I

(3:03:02) lost did we read this one from our good friend in Indonesia yeah yeah yeah I think for the 1600 uh Indonesian what is

(3:03:10) it rupees I don't know thank you um she's not a fan of makeup since I already did that one yeah I was just

(3:03:16) just because I wasn't here um by the way yeah makeup girl I'm not a fan of makeup you're beautiful all right

(3:03:22) Minnesota Liz did we do this one or no no you want a warrior in a garden not a gardener in a war men should have a

(3:03:29) sharp sword and be capable of violence I agree thank you uh Minnesota Liz appreciate it

(3:03:35) I think the ideal man is somebody who is prepared for the crisis yes and who has

(3:03:41) a mission and that mission is service of others and to make the world better and to serve God and so they need to be

(3:03:47) prepared for challenges.com they need to be prepared for violence because violence is in this

(3:03:53) world unfortunately but at the end of the day they're trying to be bring peace into the world in the way that they love

(3:03:59) and serve and build strong communities and build strong families so yes you need to be prepared for violence but not

(3:04:04) be inciting it yes I would say every man should be

(3:04:10) capable of protecting his family and his loved ones at a moment's notice this is very important

(3:04:15) I think any human should be capable of that does anyone have wait so how long have

(3:12:56) let's bring it back to this she's safe I don't know about Lila though keep your face safe don't let it don't want to

() 

(3:13:02) read it he's fine all right let me get the soup chat here um free fall here

(3:13:09) hey it's all don't trip don't even worry about it babe honey honey don't worry I

(3:13:14) got you it's all good okay thanks I got you it's all good okay um free fall think for the hundred Brian

(3:13:20) it's mostly men that laugh at me several laughed in my face during a date because I don't know much sexual things I feel

(3:13:26) that men nowadays want an OS style girl to get off and have no attachments I want to get married have my dad approve

(3:13:31) of him have babies be happy I mean yeah there's definitely dudes that are just like looking the [ __ ] that might laugh

(3:13:37) at you in that situation but Lionel what hold on hold on hold on let me just finish so uh

(3:13:43) by the way just point of clarification are you waiting until marriage or you're just not trying to [ __ ] like first date

(3:13:50) can you clarify if you're waiting like are you waiting until you're in love are you waiting into three months do you

(3:13:56) have are you virgin are you waiting to marriage clarify I just want to say too like even though I do adult work I'm

(3:14:03) still very naive and my fans still crack up when I don't know something I'm not made fun of I'm not made to be

(3:14:10) less than it's like they find it endearing so I'm sorry these men are making fun of you and you don't have to like go have all these experiences to

(3:14:17) validate your womanness this is like be you and you'll find men who will honor

(3:14:23) that you don't know that much that's okay for free fall so I dated all through my

(3:14:29) 20s and I have a lot of friends who you know different experiences but the bottom line I think would be this is

(3:14:36) that have boundaries about the kind and standards about the kind of guy that you'll even date and obviously when

(3:14:42) you're first getting to know them you don't know but once they start start coming on to you sexually pushing your boundaries just say okay I'm done and

(3:14:49) move on to the next um maybe open yourself up to another opportunity for somebody that is more

(3:14:54) noble that respects you more respects themselves more because that's what you're worth that's what your dignity is

(3:15:00) you have dignity and you deserve a guy who's going to fight for you and he's going to have high virtue and you're going to continue to grow your own

(3:15:06) virtue so that's what I would say don't don't waste too much time with those losers amen can I touch on that as well

(3:15:12) uh sure sure go ahead let me just read this really quick Rippy uh homegirl got

(3:15:17) stones in the bathroom yeah I smoked weed in the bathroom but

(3:15:22) it doesn't smell like wait did you smoke weed in the bathroom no I'm being facetious because it would smell like

(3:15:28) weed it was like one of those Vapes that's like I don't know I don't have a

(3:15:33) vape wheat pen I do have a nicotine Vape like um are you like disassociating

(3:15:40) right now like what's going on this is nicotine hello go ahead Elle I am not are you

(3:15:47) disassociating all right fair enough okay um you need a little couch for people to

(3:15:53) take a break go ahead with your point um I was just gonna say that like in the

(3:15:59) same on the opposite side of the spectrum as a single girl that does of guys completely discredit me the second

(3:16:04) they find out what I do and I I based I know I'm not I'm not saying I'm not in

(3:16:10) the point in my life where I'm like oh yeah I need I need a boyfriend I'm just saying like it can be just as difficult

(3:16:16) on the other opposite side of the spectrum so don't don't put yourself down or compare yourself because if you compare yourself to other people then it

(3:16:23) takes the gratification out of your own your own success your own happiness it's not worth it you're very smart I can

(3:16:29) tell and do you do you want to be a role model for other people ultimately is that something that you'd like to be of

(3:16:35) course and I believe that I can do both and it not be a degrading like me not I'm not I'm not degrading Myself by by

(3:16:43) I'm gonna get women are going

(3:16:53) do you think that the dream of a young girl

() 

(3:17:03) should be to be an only fan I think that a young woman should have a

(3:17:11) choice to do what she wants with her body and that it shouldn't be frowned upon to do whatever means necessary to

(3:17:18) be independent and that's my opinion and you don't have to agree with it and you don't have to agree with the way that I make my money and you reserve that right

(3:17:24) for yourself and I respect that opinion I do I think it's powerful that you are allowed to have that opinion but I don't

(3:17:30) think that I need to agree to it or co-sign it but I think we all just had this conversation Chase was talking about asking questions I think we were

(3:17:36) kind of all mostly agreeing maybe not every single person but most of us were agreeing that you know porn has really

(3:17:41) hurt Society at large and we wouldn't want to be in a relationship with a man who looked at porn a lot of men on only

(3:17:48) fans are fans are married men who are looking at the porn and their wife is you know they're being cheated on basically so I mean that role model that

(3:17:56) you want to be all right then it's news job to step up and take the market away it's back to what I said earlier men

(3:18:01) have always led the world why are we going to act like this woman's false now if there was no platform for her to make

(3:18:06) this kind of money on she she wouldn't be doing it if men were better she would be with a different man it is men's job

(3:18:12) to take this responsibility and stop subscribing to it not the girl's fault because the girl has no man to get under

(3:18:18) and get behind and believe in no man to marry no man to be submissive to and so the only thing that's out there is for

(3:18:23) her to make money with his easy way because he's weak ass [ __ ] dudes okay all right hold on hold one quick thing one thing I really appreci about what

(3:18:29) you're saying Justin is that you're saying men need to take responsibility men should take responsibility which is not a new thing it's always been this

(3:18:36) way so for us to flip it on the chicks now I think is dumb agree but I would just argue that women are strong we have

(3:18:42) agency we can make decisions I agree with some of the language coming out of the side of the table that we make decisions we make choices we should use

(3:18:49) that power for what end right it's not like men of all the power women have no power of choice women have the power to

(3:18:56) decide the standards that we hold ourselves to and that we hold men to and the kind of women we want to be and the

(3:19:01) kind of role models we want to be for the next Generation right and so I agree so here's my question Justin do you

(3:19:08) think a woman yeah we can get to let Chase speak Justin do you think a woman

(3:19:14) is being a good role model by doing only fans for the younger Generations no I

(3:19:19) think she's doing what she has to do like to do only no no she doesn't no she doesn't but when she has the option of

(3:19:26) being a look and I'm not tell you like taking up for only fans girls not on my agenda but when you look at it

(3:19:33) she's either going to go do a job where she makes no money or she makes seventy thousand dollars a month or I make less money than a man does doing the same job

(3:19:40) I mean she's well I disagree with that I I don't I don't think there's wage Gap

(3:19:45) is BS but she makes six grand a month she could find a job where she makes six grand a month it's not like I have other

(3:19:51) jobs that I've done before where I make way more than six grand a month but that doesn't mean that I can't so why would

(3:19:57) you stop it what my point is is that not so much to defend the only

(3:20:04) fans girl but to empower young men to be stronger more capable so a lot of these

(3:20:10) girls can find a man that they want to get behind instead of getting behind a screen and selling porn that's basically

(3:20:15) and Justin hold on Lila I agree with that point yeah that like men need to

(3:20:20) become stronger so that you know women can get behind them and so they don't have to feel like they have to resort to

(3:20:25) doing only fans but like it's gonna take a while for us to change a generation of men into becoming let's do it because we

(3:20:31) want to do it hold on into becoming into becoming strong to the point where women don't have to resort to doing only fans

(3:20:37) right it's going to take a while yeah and the truth is that if we took porn away from young men that they would be

(3:20:43) incentivized to go become that strong man I'm all for getting rid of porn I'm all for them

(3:20:50) I love that and everybody in our everybody in this space there were a lot of people in this space would would

(3:20:56) naturally easy decision almost 100 out of 100 say get rid of porn I'm all how

(3:21:02) could we do that like how that's a great question well that that gets to like a

(3:21:07) governmental level yeah I mean we'd have to legislate legislate them well I think it's it I think there's legislation that

(3:21:13) can be done to ban porn because they think it is but that's that would go back to making the United the United

(3:21:19) States of America have its Christian backgrounds come and stand up to the point where people would go vote for it

(3:21:24) in that way but I think the other thing the other thing too is it kind of takes a leap of faith as women because if

(3:21:30) culture is demanding from us right I mean that's what you guys are we're dealing with cultures we're swimming in

(3:21:36) is sexually objectifying women rewarding women for sexually objectification right and so but I I do think there's a rule

(3:21:43) of personal responsibility that women were not doomed to anything we can make any choice we want and we can start over

(3:21:49) we can do walk a different path and we can be the women that we dream to be

(3:21:55) that isn't just making you know money on the internet one way we can I am the woman I dream to be I've arrived and I'm

(3:22:02) so happy with her younger me would look at me in a grocery store now and be like oh my God she's so

(3:22:08) hot like I want to be her when I grow up I wouldn't even question it but I also just want to say like who out of the women here who's been cat called before

(3:22:15) in public

(3:22:22) um I'm just saying like if if a woman is going to get sexualized she might as well do it in a controlled environment

(3:22:28) where she can make profit and I'm sorry that's the way I feel I love it uh I

(3:22:34) mean you're putting if there's a difference between being cat called though and like actually like putting

(3:22:40) your [ __ ] tits on the internet yeah you are completely putting yourself you're asking you're asking well I'll

(3:22:45) tell you another thing you're doing it again you're hype you're you're inflating your vagina and your titties because if it's out there for the world

(3:22:52) to see it's like it's kind of like you're taking yourself off the gold standard of like the secrecy of like sex

(3:22:58) and relationships like a man that's gonna marry you probably wouldn't want your titties on the internet for every other man in the world to see so like

(3:23:04) when you said you were when you got married you're gonna take it down like I think that's probably ideal for for the

(3:23:10) marriage I mean they probably do the same but it's on the same count all her her shit's probably leaked all over the

(3:23:15) Internet yeah no it always be there it'd always be there but like I think one of the biggest problems in society is that

(3:23:21) we've cheapened sex that sex is just something that's thrown around it's just like this commodity it's literally sold

(3:23:27) and I think sex is supposed to be something it is something sacred and

(3:23:32) beautiful and amazing and it's designed for two people who are just passionately in love and committed to each other

(3:23:38) publicly for life and also sex can bring human beings into the world and it does and so that's the other thing that was

(3:23:45) not even really talked about a lot at the stable but sex can bring human beings into the world so we should be having sex in relationships that are

(3:23:51) prepared to be can I can I say amen and that'll make a society and happier okay

(3:23:57) sex okay sex is like an exchange of energy excuse me it's an exchange of

(3:24:04) energy between two people so like when you have sex with someone like you're

(3:24:10) really like into the mic when you have sex with them with someone you're like

(3:24:16) exchanging energy with that person oh no you exchanged some energy with whatever drugs you're on right now that's why

(3:24:22) what about it though what about the exchange of energy

(3:24:31) but I do have to say something for the men and women you

(3:24:37) for sure for sure um what you got for us oh girls we need to be better role

(3:24:43) models for the younger generation and guys yeah you have a girlfriend at home you're looking at only fans you're a sad boy yes

(3:24:50) oh wow okay you love ecstasy

(3:24:58) did anybody else hear ecstasy I got an exit statement because she's leaving if

() 

(3:25:04) you're into the MDMA it's all good okay um question before you leave because I wanted to get everyone's on this trying

(3:25:10) to maybe we'll come back to what we're talking about let's talk a little bit about body count here because it's dating show dating podcast hello

(3:25:17) um body count uh should body count matter just should body count matter yes

(3:25:23) better in what way I guess is my question it's very important for what well for example uh typically you hear

(3:25:29) men preferring women who have a low body count do you object to men caring about

(3:25:37) body count you can care about whatever you want like but it doesn't mean I care about it fair enough

(3:25:44) yes and no I mean I I don't know I feel like I've always been just like if you

(3:25:50) sleep around with people like you're you're going to be looked down upon and I feel like just for that reason it's like that's just been like instilled it

(3:25:55) to me it's like I I don't sleep around because it's like that's always been instilled that's frowned upon I think

(3:26:02) it's frowned upon for good reason or no I agree yeah J Dog what you got for us

(3:26:07) scientifically I understand why it does matter scientifically but you think it

(3:26:13) shouldn't matter I mean no purely just based on science alone it does and it

(3:26:19) should okay um it matters I wouldn't want to date a pig

(3:26:25) into the mic into the mic it matters you wouldn't want to date a pig yeah what do you have against pigs

(3:26:31) [Music] cute man I just want to hug her every

(3:26:37) time she talks some guys are just very pigs you know so oh oh okay I would not

(3:26:43) want to sleep with someone or be with someone who has a very high body count okay and you and you say that like like

(3:26:50) you wouldn't want to sleep with a man that has a high body count because most men commend each other whenever they they get laid you know yeah my I've

(3:26:57) asked my boyfriend about his body count it's very low so your thoughts should body count matter do you object to men caring about body

(3:27:04) count all right all right what about you you

(3:27:09) ever [ __ ] about body count when I date women I don't care if they have a high body count bro I'm gonna null this [ __ ] marriage okay what do you um oh

(3:27:17) okay I think body count matters a lot why profound because

(3:27:25) like I said sex is very important like who you have sex with is really

(3:27:32) important and your body count should not be high because if you're exchanging

(3:27:37) energy with like a lot of different people you're you don't know who you're

(3:27:42) like you're spreading it you don't yeah you don't know who it is and so it's like question four as a woman wait just

(3:27:50) real quick question you said your body count shouldn't be

(3:28:01) it shouldn't be high your body count should be low as low as possible

(3:28:08) all right okay uh what about you what your thoughts what do you guys think I'm gonna say I think body count should be

(3:28:15) one person if you get married and that's the person that you marry preferably and I don't really like term body count

(3:28:20) because it sounds like dead bodies after sex when sex is supposed to be beautiful and life-giving and amazing between one

(3:28:25) two people in a marriage so anyways yeah I suppose we could change it to like how many

() 

(3:28:31) people you've had sexual intercourse but I'll say one more thing I think I think no matter how high anybody's body count

(3:28:37) is there can be a start over point where you decide I'm not going to keep living

(3:28:44) that way I'm going to live a different way and that that change is possible I'm sorry but once you've slept with like

(3:28:50) 100 dudes it's I don't care if you're born again I mean Mary Magdalene is one of the greatest Saints of all time and

(3:28:56) she actually was the first first person she was a host she was home she was

(3:29:01) description I looked into this it was resurrected like a week and a half ago has it

(3:29:07) actually been proven that she was like a prostitute tradition says that there is a tradition that says yes she was

(3:29:13) involved in prostitution that's fine but I prefer a virgin over a born-again virgin especially if she was a

(3:29:19) prostitute especially if she was a problem

(3:29:26) so I I freaking brought this apple and orange and you guys have just been groping it all night off the table yeah

(3:33:37) rule 76 no excuses play Like A Champion what's your body count

(3:33:42) like literally like over a hundred but it's not like literally for too long and I'm starting to talk

(3:33:49) like a valley [ __ ] uh do you think it's over 200 no so

(3:33:55) between 100 and 200 I mean I don't I do I don't just keep tabs on all of that

(3:34:14) sure that it's triple digit it's at least triple digit I mean yeah

(3:34:19) so like 193. yeah right 193 yeah really

(3:34:25) a lot of it's girls though what percentage would you say is girls half

(3:34:31) is it more girls or more guys if you had to I'd say it's probably

(3:34:36) foreign

(3:34:48) I was curious if you're looking at a girl what's what's your limit like I don't know if you care about body count

(3:34:53) but if you're looking at having a relationship with a girl what's your limit I mean ideally it's a single digit number man and anything past that it's

(3:34:59) probably just a different bucket for the girl that's all yeah you know I'm not super insecure with my ability not to Alpha widow or myself so bro I want to

(3:35:07) know I want to know Justin's body count bro I don't even know no judge me so you don't judge women on

(3:35:14) their body count that they would go into it they just go into a different bucket in my mind

(3:35:20) donated 200 I understand to be on another planet

(3:35:31) I think that one there came through all right let me do some super chats here let's do the twitch let me shout out twitch really quick uh yo guys twitch.tv

(3:35:39) slash whatever drop us a prime sub uh if you have one uh drop us a follow if you

(3:35:45) have one more to more to more more Mortimer McFly I think for the tier one Dark Knight

(3:35:50) thing for the prime zdm con thing for the prime Almighty Titan thing for the follow talking thing for the follow uh

(3:35:57) tuna melt thing for the follow hey Cooper thing for the following uh Rob

() 

(3:36:02) thanks for the prime appreciate it guys okay um let me do some sleep shots here Brian can I ask

(3:36:07) while we have Justin here I have a question for him because his his time and his Insight is valuable

(3:36:13) Justin you've talked tonight about the fact that we need to create more strong men who can

(3:36:19) effectively lead and provide for women this is something that I personally agree with a thousand percent I think

(3:36:26) that we need to make men great again it's something I often think about too in terms of like how can we change this

(3:36:32) generation event and the future generations of men like what do you think is the best way societally to make men great again like how do we how do we

(3:36:38) get ourselves out of this mess that we're in obviously Banning porn you and I are on the same page about that yeah I think

(3:36:44) you could bam porn I think you stopped placating to people's feelings so much and let them get out there and actually compete you know we're coming off a

(3:36:51) generation that everybody gets a trophy and I know that's a real popular answer but letting letting them live with the

(3:36:56) harsh realities that if they don't perform they won't actually have a wife or a family it'll end up going to guys

(3:37:01) at the top and that's actually in a lot of ways kind of playing out some historical

(3:37:07) issues that we might have had I believe that the reason Christianity was good and the reason religion is good is that

(3:37:12) you you followed around it's like every man's got a shot at a wife and a family if we keep going down the path a weak

(3:37:18) man guys like me or guys like Tater guys like whomever will have all the pick of all the women and social media is doing

(3:37:24) nothing but amplifying that so I think it's going to take men going through a lot of pain to realize that they're going to have to compete if they want to

(3:37:30) have a real woman in the real world otherwise only fans will continue to excel porn will continue to excel sex

(3:37:35) dolls will continue to Excel and um I think that would be a shame for society

(3:37:40) because it was going to leave a lot of angry young men a lot of people shooting up schools a lot of a lot of pain in the

(3:37:46) world that's not necessary I agree have you have you guys seen I know you're part of the War Room correct yeah

(3:37:52) have you guys seen a lot of young men turn their lives around as a part of that every day every day that somebody joins the real world where we're

(3:37:58) teaching guys directly how to make real money in real time by people that are doing an actual business the business that they're teaching

(3:38:04) or guys that joined the war room and start to learn how to get their frame correct how to get in shape how to

(3:38:10) defend themselves how to dress how to make money it's changing lives every day this is nothing more that I could be

(3:38:15) more excited about being a part of nothing that's more fulfilling to me than helping those young men's because you don't build strong men in spite of

(3:38:22) women you build them for women and the two go together men and women are equal just in different ways and so if we can

(3:38:29) build men to be strong then maybe women will allow allow a man to be the

(3:38:34) masculine and and find their lame in the feminine and actually be happy with it but it's got to start with the guys they

(3:38:39) desperately want it I believe in a thousand percent women don't want to be men as much as they might say we do

(3:38:45) surveys and they find out women who consider abortion so I see abortion as the greatest human rights abuse of our

(3:38:50) day and that women who consider abortion it's typically the number the number one person they turn to is the man like will

(3:38:57) he fight for her will he fight for that baby and 86 percent of women who have abortions today are unmarried one thing

(3:39:04) then there was men are M.I.A in the vast majority of those cases right well I would say another thing too is like

(3:39:10) let's stop patronizing women that want to be in the masculine frame you know that want that want to be a Home Keeper

(3:39:16) that want to be a mother being a mother is the hardest job on the [ __ ] planet dude it is a hard physically emotionally

(3:39:22) mentally demanding job that is very very necessary for children to grow up in the right frame of mind to feel loved to

(3:39:29) feel safe to be able to develop and grow being a mother is one of the most important jobs on the planet right up there with veterans and school teachers

(3:39:35) and the cops people Overlook these jobs but without these types of jobs a mother being one of them Society does not work

(3:39:42) as a whole and if we don't get that right we'll fail I agree how many yeah yeah it is how many of the guys in the

(3:39:49) War Room by the way how many would you say are looking for like a wife and to start a family with how many of them

(3:39:54) want to live that Playboy lifestyle what's what's this I think there's a strong population of guys in the war room that would just like to find a good

(3:40:01) woman and that would that would be the war room is way more about family than you would think it just outwardly

(3:40:07) looking at it do you guys have dudes in there building successful families and and you guys yes we do you guys think

(3:40:14) that if a woman has um like experience sexually that just makes

(3:40:20) her not a good enough woman to marry no nobody said that I think I think ideally the guy men in general would want that

(3:40:26) to be low but we get to ask our body count but you guys don't have to reveal yours so I just I just wonder 400 I

(3:40:33) don't know I have no idea right okay but I'm I'm gonna get in the chat like oh she's yeah but remember the very

(3:40:38) beginning okay cool cool you know what I mean no I don't I don't I think I think that's I think that men that that clap

(3:40:45) for men that are having sex with a bunch of women that's a lame ass thing to kind of yeah I think it's something it's a

(3:40:50) criticize well hold on hold on I'm not criticized I understand why the criticism let me be very clear I don't care wait let me be really clear with

(3:40:57) you I told you at the beginning of the conversation life is not fair no so and I was not patronizing your body count so

(3:41:03) I'm not over here rolling my eyes if you want to [ __ ] a million dudes do it I didn't put you in a box I said ideally

(3:41:08) the bot the yeah a bucket box whatever you particularly your number I might put you in the cornfield again but the point

(3:41:16) that the point that I'm trying to make the point I'm trying to make to you is this is that yes there are guys in the war room that

(3:41:23) do want to build families and do want to have children and we even have rooms specifically talking about parenting the

(3:41:28) war room is the best group in the world Bar None has down it's not even close you would be lucky to find a man in the

(3:41:34) war room I don't I mean I'm not trying to be insensitive I just don't know what that I I'm not no no yeah I know but at

(3:41:40) the same time like I wasn't over here talking about your number no I know I'm just hearing you say that men and women

(3:41:45) should be like equal and or whatever the way that you phrased it of equal value

(3:41:50) of equal value men or women are of equal value in different ways I mean men do rule the world they build and maintain

(3:41:57) Society I'm not confused about that but I I'll never I would never hold on I

(3:42:02) would never ever ever discredit how important a woman is in in

(3:42:07) the relationship between the two yeah well that's not true I mean I want to

(3:42:12) Echo what you said about motherhood because that's underappreciated in society and we look down on Mothers yeah

(3:42:18) other women go out in the career like accomplish all these things

(3:42:23) and can't accomplish tons of things but I think we should be Celebrating Motherhood a lot more as a society and

(3:42:29) helping mothers be mothers I also think waiting the challenges a lot of women aren't even able to be with their kids

(3:42:34) they have to be out working or they're not able to make anything a thousand percent can I say something important I

(3:42:40) am very pro-life and I just think that it's really important to be a mother

(3:42:45) it's it's so important and I think that if you are having sex unprotected

(3:42:54) hold on I I have another I have another question I have another

(3:43:00) I have another question for Justin while we have out here sure because we've been caught up in a lot of [ __ ] for the past hour and a half

(3:43:06) what um what do you think the men of this

(3:43:11) generation need to do so you're a father correct yeah yeah what do you think the

(3:43:16) men of this generation need to do like that I I speak with a lot of aspiring fathers what do you think the the men of

(3:43:22) this generation need to do to prepare to become the best fathers that they possibly can take full responsibility of

(3:43:27) the situation that you're in completely and don't forget that you get to take care of a family you get to take care

(3:43:34) you get to be the hero in the life of your wife or your kids or anybody that's around you that leans on you you get to

(3:43:41) get out of bed every morning and do those things that is the beautiful thing about love I don't I don't want to be

(3:43:47) around or take care of anybody that doesn't need me in that way because that's the most beautiful part mental

(3:43:52) health therapist and a Christian this whole podcast is painful to listen to knowing what I know Brian let me know

(3:43:59) when you need another conservative girl on Chase let me know when you're ready for a wife Layla here hire me I'm so

(3:44:05) inspired to fight for Life P.S help red I love Elissa

(3:44:10) dot org and I'd love to work with you yeah Alyssa thank you uh for the uh

(3:44:15) Super Chat really appreciate it uh you can DM well or whatever is not

(3:44:21) working you DMP under BD underscore Atlas if you're interested in being on the show uh if I can speak on Chase's

(3:44:27) behalf on this uh he doesn't he's not looking for a dog you got Chase

(3:44:33) blonde is she blonde she gotta be blonde and a virgin right yeah we'd be perfect together he doesn't

(3:44:40) need to be a virgin to desire a virgin I'm just asking because you ask our body counts what's your body count Chase seven what about you

(3:44:48) as a man of God I do not reveal my body count is it seven like the pin on your

(3:44:53) shirt I can either confirm nor deny my body count but Chase may I ask how

(3:45:00) long you've been celibate three years and what prompted you to do that I wanted God's favor over my life I also

(3:45:07) realized that continuing to fornicate was a sin against God against my own body and also against the woman that I

(3:45:13) was having sex with I also look at the times that we're living in I uh see fulfillment to

(3:45:18) biblical prophecy happening around us and like I said I wanted God's favor over my life so

(3:45:24) that's beautiful and do you yeah I love that and do you feel better me too do

(3:45:29) you feel better since you've been celibate like like physically or like spiritually or

(3:45:36) emotionally or what are you asking all the above the whole plethora of it all uh it brings me greater peace knowing

(3:45:42) that uh that I am honoring God with my body and so since you don't watch like porn

(3:45:49) either um you're just like completely like you don't you know I'm not saying that I

(3:45:56) don't experience temptation but okay just do my best to keep it under control okay all right we have free fall here uh

(3:46:03) Free Fall thank you for the uh subsequence uh 100 Super Chat really appreciate all your support tonight girl

(3:46:08) in pink and jean jacket girl or actually Madison can you read this please if you can see girl in pink and jean jacket

(3:46:14) girl thank you for being so empathetic Chase would you be with the girl whose family's backgrounds is Muslim but she

(3:46:19) isn't also Brian and I learned what Audis are because of you LOL educational

(3:46:25) podcasts LOL if I ever meet you all in person I want a hug uh

(3:46:30) to answer your question one of the marital values that's important for me is making sure that I'm aligned in terms

(3:46:38) of values with my future wife's family that that's very important I want to have my wife's parents support in the

(3:46:45) things that I'm doing in my life I want to make sure that we're all on the same page in terms of our values the way that we approach religion

(3:46:51) there's a low likelihood that I would be with a girl whose family is Muslim even if she isn't

(3:46:58) I'm so wait I I'm assuming here then is she saying that she's a Muslim I mean

(3:47:03) that would seem that would seem to be the implication yeah like she was Muslims most the most important value is

(3:47:09) that she is a Christian uh but if her family is Muslim that's would be a tough sell for me personally

(3:47:16) that does that does Whittle down the dating pool because there's a lot of losers out there I know we were talking about that earlier and like weird guys

(3:47:22) and they wanted you know you were to talk about they're coming on to you and it's so horrible and I found when I

(3:47:28) dated guys that matched my values and they were proud about it and they were like saying yes I'm Catholic yes I

(3:47:33) believe in what the church teaches it automatically now that doesn't mean there aren't Catholic guys who are

(3:47:39) messed up but what it does mean is it kind of creates a dating pool that's stronger so you're less likely to meet

(3:47:44) weirdos basically thank you Victor appreciate it man thank you

(3:47:50) been wondering about you guys is take on the age when you should have kids as a man I've achieved what I would call

(3:47:56) Professional success at a young age and my first kid at 30 my second at 33 a lot

(3:48:02) of my friends are waiting to be more successful we're already 35.

(3:48:07) is there a question here um on the age when you should have kids as a man

(3:48:14) uh what did you just Jack the Apple bro um I didn't think you'd notice

(3:48:21) uh I think you should have kids when you're ready you are in a position to

(3:48:29) be able to financially support them retire the mother if you can retire the mother do it what was the question uh

(3:48:36) what age men should have kids yeah I think he nailed it though I mean in your 30s is a great time I and then

(3:48:43) if you want to do it before that I'd be sure that I I could at least retire the mom so she could raise them

(3:48:48) you know what I'll tell you guys what uh the word of God says about this because I love it

(3:48:54) Psalm chapter 127 verse 4 says the children you do uh you need to leave

(3:49:01) okay you gotta go see ya okay I not just

(3:49:09) that was my [ __ ] that's that's what I wanted to do when I was standing up earlier man I watched her walk out of

(3:49:15) that bathroom and I could tell she was extremely intoxicated and I wanted to say I wanted to send her backing

(3:49:21) ah bro all right um

(3:49:28) anyways moving on about the the um the whole Tate ideology so it sounds

(3:49:34) like it's basically Islam it's an ideology if you want to know yeah I think you'd

(3:49:40) have to ask the boys directly or you could watch any of the content that they've put out around them it sounds

(3:49:45) like Justin's got a front row seat so I mean to be honest like it's not hard

(3:49:51) to understand like they the Tates have put out a ton of content on about their perspective on women right and like

(3:49:56) people they only hear like the quote unquote misogynistic clips that come out where they say like super over the top

(3:50:01) stuff about women but like correct me if I'm wrong Justin their General message is like love your woman

(3:50:07) take care of your woman they believe in you know being a quote unquote like Unchained man like seeing as many women

(3:50:12) as you want that's obviously part of the ideology in Islam but like they're not advocating that men like abuse women or

(3:50:19) take advantage of women or anything like that they say over the top stuff so that it goes viral but like he like generally

(3:50:25) speaking he's from what I've seen Andrew Tate has been he's told men like become the strongest man that you can to take

(3:50:31) care of your woman and protect your woman like that's what your woman wants from you become a good leader for your woman and like she will love you for it

(3:50:38) right so do you basically agree with Andrew Tate up until polygamy yeah I mean that's like Andrew Tate's

(3:50:45) made a million different statements well largely speaking I agree with some of the stuff that he says and I disagree with other things that he says obviously

(3:50:52) I disagree with the polygamy part it's good yeah yeah I can tell you as a person that spent serious time with

(3:50:57) Andrew interest and that I've never ever ever not only see them not be rude to a

(3:51:03) woman but not be rude or unkind to any person that's come in their path ever not one time ever not even a slip that's

(3:51:11) great so any woman that is in either one of those men's lives is very well taken

(3:51:16) care of and uh very much respected in the presence of Andrew and Tristan and treat you quite well

(3:51:23) I'll tell you something I disagree with that they've done historically uh you know obviously

(3:51:28) Andrew and Tristan have talked about how they would you know basically make women fall in love with them and then they

(3:51:34) would entice them into doing only fans and they would you know basically have the women make money for them like that's something I

(3:51:40) disagree with obviously um what do you think about that Justin

(3:51:48) I think that Andrew and Tristan's decisions with their girls are up to them number one and I don't think that

(3:51:54) any girl was ever kept ever ever ever against her will and I think that any

(3:52:00) women woman that they've worked with including staff and otherwise will tell you nothing but good things about Andrew

(3:52:06) and Tristan so much so that many of these girls have come online and said that they

(3:52:11) love Tristan and Andrew and were never working against their will and it's unfortunate that all of a sudden once

(3:52:18) these girls have a thought for themselves that the Romanian government wants to say that they've been brainwashed when they're actively doing

(3:52:24) it on their own it's a joke Andrew and Tristan have never abused a woman is certainly not around me and and

(3:52:30) certainly not anything that I've heard of so take it as you want

(3:52:35) that's been my experience and that's clearly been the experience of many women that they've been with yeah and

(3:52:41) there's also been no evidence no credible evidence from what I understand that's been put forth of any abuse and they're still under house arrest with no

(3:52:48) charges so you know um they also have footage in that house

(3:52:55) that if they wanted to they could just go watch all the footage when you walk into Andrew's house one of the first

(3:53:00) things you see is is a 70-inch TV with all the camera angles so if they wanted the truth they would get it

(3:53:06) all right somebody said I got that in the Stream here pretty soon uh let's just get the soup chats

(3:53:13) and we gotta we got that in the Stream um okay so uh let's see Philip call hundred dollar soup chat where do you

(3:53:19) women get off and downplay the equality of a man and a woman uh Unity I served in the military for 17 years and agree that I am a man that can

(3:54:12) uh nine nine thousand five hundred that's a lot Justin if there is any

(3:54:17) piece of advice that you could give all the people out there so that we can fix this screwed up dating world and uh have

(3:54:23) healthier relationships out there in the world what would you say I would just say as a young man take full accountability and for the young ladies

(3:54:29) don't don't ever let anybody shame you if you find a man worth getting behind and decide to do that it'd be an

(3:54:36) absolute shame to see that happen that's it all right quite on bro all right um yeah so guys uh hit that like
