(1:35) [Music]
(1:50) all right everybody I've been putting off uh uh checking this debate out so we're going to do it now I think I think
(1:57) I want to do a standalone react video so we're just going to treat this kind of like practice um the stream yes the
(2:05) stream yesterday was not great cuz I was sitting there trying to like trying to
(2:11) have absolutely no like dead time um because I was going to you know put that
(2:17) in my React videos playlist and so that's actually very very hard to do so
(2:22) we're just going to we're just going to act normal here and go through this and
(2:28) uh treat this as a trial run see yeah Andrew Wilson he's just he's the most
(2:33) sanctimonious uh dishonest debater well not the most but he he very much is so
(2:40) and I think that he thinks he's pretty clever because he goes on the whatever podcast and debates uh 14-year-old girls
(2:48) all the time so they oh whoops I have my I don't have
(2:53) my sound settings uh set up correctly let's see
(3:02) here Andrew Wilson doesn't debate I mean yeah not really humanist Manifesto which
(3:08) is actually called humanism and its aspirations humanist Manifesto 3
(3:13) 10-minute opening statements from each guest what the hell Andrew the floor is all yours for your 10-minute
(3:20) opening and it's three blah blah blah it's got a stupid title it's terribly
(3:26) written and it's complete nonsense and no human being should ever here six I go live on Tik Tok on the weekends but I
(3:33) might do a Tik Tok live before Saturday I'm not sure but I pretty much do it at
(3:39) Saturdays and Sundays right around 11:00 a.m. Pacific time so 2:00 p.m. eastern
(3:45) time to it for the purpose of human flourishing or anything else yet some do like U Craig here its greatest issue is
(3:53) simply that it only makes vague descriptive claims and not one prescription for what it should actually
(3:59) do yeah neither does Christianity he does this he does this stupid thing like
(4:04) we're not going to watch this whole two-hour video but he does this stupid thing in there where he says where specifically in the manifesto does it
(4:11) say you're not allowed to and I don't remember what it was like lock people up and torture them or whatever and it's
(4:17) like where in the Bible does it say don't do slavery nowhere where in the Bible does it say don't do crypto scams
(4:24) nowhere where in the Bible does it say don't go 120 mph in a school zone
(4:30) nowhere like it's it no no legal system
(4:36) or moral system or whatever is literally just a declaration of every single
(4:41) conceivable thing you are not allowed to do that's completely idiotic so I propose a new revised
(4:49) Manifesto and I'm calling it humanist for society and its consequences note
(4:54) while drinking in my cramped hotel room last night at an airport holiday in James
(5:00) I wrote this Manifesto which is the culmination of aund Wilson generations of drunken reason Irish sensibilities
(5:07) and just a drab of single malt whiskey now the he's also very performative and
(5:12) has no interest in debating quite a lot of the time the quote unquote normal modern-day debate viewer who we would
(5:19) just re refer to in The Crucible as oh Ben why are your feelings so hurt you
(5:25) made a running joke of presupposition yet you wrote a conclusion of the debate before you watched it you're a joke
(5:31) outside of beating up mentally challenged flat earthers okay I've I've watched some of
(5:37) this video I was watching uh some of it live so no I've I've heard plenty of
(5:42) what Andrew Wilson has said before um not very smart he ain't GNA [ __ ] you lil
(5:48) bro he's he's not going to do it um and you know kind of fun to
(5:55) philosophically torture much like a cat and mouse gently severing their St from their body Peace by agonizing peace
(6:02) metaphorically of course not to mention being better than them in basically has attempted to make a single argument life
(6:08) luckily The Crucible is here in case the low IQ MDD liberal scum wants to whine
(6:14) and cry for another two hours of Q&A after their man humping Earth daddy fled the room with his boy toy tears in his
(6:20) eyes while his dress was flowing I don't think we're what is that even mean going to see a repeat of that this time though
(6:26) right I'm going nowhere okay great oh he's talking about Matt okay you can leave fun let's so let's
(6:33) launch into my new and improved humanist Manifesto Craig will be unable to refute
(6:39) any of my prescriptions based on his Manifesto if he only uses his Manifesto instead he will require a normative
(6:46) framework to supplement that Manifesto the um maybe I'm an idiot but isn't the
(6:52) manifesto literally a normative framework doesn't it begin with these claims that humans are a social species
(6:59) so on and so forth humanist
(7:05) Manifesto what the [ __ ] is this [Laughter] picture uh humanist Manifesto one well
(7:12) he said that they're up to three now humans and its aspirations human humanism is a progressive philosophy of
(7:19) life that without supernaturalism affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal
(7:25) fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity um so yeah that's literally the
(7:32) normative uh framework right there so he said he said unless you appeal to
(7:38) outside or at least that's how I was interpreting it um outside normative normative Frameworks
(7:44) or whatever holy [ __ ] my smart Zoom is not working um knowledge of the world is
(7:50) derived by yeah so I've read these before but it's been a while knowledge of the world is derived by why is my
(7:56) smart Zoom being such a piece of [ __ ] Apple work with me here there we go um
(8:03) knowledge is derived in these ways yes humans are an integral part of nature yes ethical values are derived
(8:10) from human needs that's it isn't this a normative framework somebody like chat
(8:17) tell me if I'm being stupid but isn't this humans are social by nature and Find meaning in relationships working to
(8:23) benefit Society maximizes individual happiness um Etc so maybe we I don't
(8:30) know maybe we can come back to this later he has to do this because without using the manifesto what what are we
(8:37) even arguing about I can refute his prescriptions based on Christian ethics Church tradition and effects to society
(8:44) which is what this debate's about Andrew those are just going to be your opinions or somebody else's regurgitated opinions
(8:51) like I don't know what's he going to mean by I can refute them um he can
(8:57) disagree with them but to ref them I mean if you're going to refute it don't
(9:03) you have to find contradictions within it like saying well I don't agree I have a different opinion that's not a
(9:10) reputation what is best for society but he's unable to apply that standard with
(9:15) the humanist Manifesto itself he must have Kyle that's what I've seen before too somebody was he was debating
(9:22) something about I think it was about transgenderism I don't even remember what it was and somebody brought up like
(9:28) a medical an or something and he just said oh those are so rare and he refused
(9:34) to engage with it so yeah I've I've seen that kind of thing from him before
(9:40) appeal to the sources outside this Manifesto so humanism has no real measurable actual conceivable effect on
(9:47) society yet Christianity does that's so incredibly false what kind of statement
(9:53) is that it has no measurable impact on soci how could he say that he offers
(9:59) descriptions I offer prescriptions so here it is I'm going to
(10:04) read to you the tenants of humanism according to the humanist Manifesto itself their own words and then apply a
(10:11) reasonable and logical prescription to each tenant now Craig has to debunk each of my prescriptions using the humanist
(10:17) Manifesto or he loses why does he lose so it's supposed to be Christianity or
(10:23) secular humanism which is best and so far Andrew is not making an attempt to I
(10:31) mean we'll see there there's a lot more of this for us to go through obviously but he's not making an attempt
(10:37) to um defend his position he's doing the Classic this is actually it's almost
(10:45) like this is how arguments from ignorance typically work they say well I can prove that you can't do XY or Z or
(10:53) prove it I like okay um then that leaves us with no conclusion no no no I will
(10:59) now jump to my own conclusion but you haven't demonstrated uh any efficacy or
(11:04) validity of your take doesn't matter well because I can debunk the stated prescriptions easily
(11:11) using Christian oh chat I I have to tell you guys something um apparently Jim Bob
(11:17) was reviewing the video I uploaded today on YouTube and I somebody told me about
(11:22) it and I tuned in and Jim Bob was playing guitar and he was singing the guy's a [ __ ] incredibly good singer
(11:29) he sounds like if Bob Dylan was really good at singing so I I I gotta I gotta
(11:34) admit it he's really good ethics and he can't debunk or even successfully argue against one using the humanist Manifesto
(11:41) he requires something else do you see the problem here one first tenant humanist Manifesto
(11:48) knowledge of the world is derived by observation experiment and rational analysis humanists find that science is
(11:55) the best method for determining this knowledge as well as solving problems and and developing beneficial
(12:00) Technologies my prescription based on that the birth rate is low therefore all women must be forcibly bred experiments
(12:07) must be conducted on them to maximize fertility and thereby maximize human flourishing because so he's doing all
(12:13) these completely idiotic hypotheticals okay in order to in order
(12:18) to science is the best best method for determining this knowledge is solving our problems birth rates are low so let
(12:26) us therefore forcibly uh inseminate women and turn them uh turn them into
(12:31) uterus factories right science and that is good humans this is 10 two no so
(12:38) there is no jump to that that would be good because it very lazily and unimaginatively says that well birth
(12:46) rates are low so first of all are low birth rates a problem for the current
(12:51) structure of the system we have I guess but they not ought to be there's there's
(12:58) no reason that they ought to be therefore there are uh countless different things we could do other like
(13:04) we can literally just create a world that is better despite low birth
(13:10) rates there now we don't have now we don't have to say that um well we must
(13:16) do you know the uh uh forcibly breed women or whatever um and then just to
(13:24) say that that would be good just because uh so he's
(13:30) this is just very classic the ends don't justify the means right on what grounds
(13:36) does anybody have the right to uh Force somebody to do something with their body
(13:42) that they don't want to do there's no like what's the logical argument for
(13:50) that let's let me re I'll rewind that back a little bit and listen to what else my prescription based on that the
(13:56) birth rate is low therefore all women must be forcibly read experiments must be conducted on them to maximize
(14:02) fertility and thereby maximize human flourishing because science and that is
(14:07) good yeah so like literally nobody said that um science equals good or like
(14:16) morally good or anything like that because I mean he kind of said this earlier it's uh science and whatever is
(14:22) descriptive not prescriptive so he's giving the prescriptions then his whole thing is
(14:27) Craig can't um give any rebuttal by using the manifesto for
(14:33) this um I I mean we could literally just go
(14:39) down the line I does it say anything about um like suffering or pain working
(14:45) to okay so Progressive cultures have worked to free Humanity from the brutalities of mere survival and to
(14:51) reduce suffering improve societies and develop Global communities we seek to minimize the inequities of circumstance
(14:58) and abil ility and we support a just distribution of uh Nature's resource so
(15:04) like literally this um part right here literally tells you that there's
(15:10) absolutely no need or you can't justify uh forcing the people to be turned into
(15:17) uterus factories based off of that so here we go what do you guys think I
(15:22) haven't really been paying attention um low birth rates are a sign of the world is a better place uh yeah
(15:29) that's kind of true in a way like it can cause problems but there's no reason that you can't do anything about them um
(15:36) we could clone and raise ourselves yeah so we could literally do artificial you
(15:41) could do artificial wombs like what they do in the in the Superman movie Man of Steel um you ought not to hurt your
(15:48) fellow man you ought to respect consent yeah I mean I maybe those things aren't
(15:54) in the manifesto but it doesn't really matter I guess uh
(16:00) um Craigs should have yeah I mean I I wouldn't say that Craig really did all that well here humans this is 10 at2 of
(16:07) the uh Manifesto humans are an integral part of nature the result of unguided evolutionary change humanists recognize
(16:14) nature as self-existing we accept our life uh as all and enough distinguished
(16:19) things as they are from the things we might wish or imagine them to be so my
(16:25) prescription based on this vague nonsense because human are unguided they require guidance maximum for oh man I
(16:32) can't believe how stupid I am so I I forgot to bring up the uh number one issue at this if Andrew doesn't think
(16:40) that it's like if Andrew thinks it his prescription uh that he gave to that first tenant is
(16:47) wrong then the only thing you need to say is what if God said to do it and then Andrew has no choice but to say
(16:53) that it's good so literally according to Andrew it's not bad so I don't I don't see or it it may not be bad so I don't
(17:01) really see what the critic or where the grounds for criticism lies vague
(17:07) nonsense because humans are unguided they require guidance maximum force from the state can lend itself to maximum
(17:13) result to be so my prescription based on this vague nonsense because humans are
(17:19) unguided they require guidance maximum force from the state can lend itself to maximum results people ought to accept
(17:25) things as they are and that requires ending all char to avoid giving them false hope and that is good what the
(17:33) [ __ ] what what chat what is it talking about human humans are an integral part
(17:38) of nature the result of unguided evolutionary changes humanists recognize nature as self-existing we accept our
(17:45) lives as all and enough distinguishing things as they are from things as we
(17:50) might wish or imagine them to be therefore Humanity requires an
(17:56) authoritative state to tell them what to do do therefore end charity what is the
(18:04) like what could possibly be the argument there it's Craig not Craig uh okay my my
(18:12) mistake but we got to rewind this because this is just so hard to follow we might wish or humanists recognize
(18:19) nature as self-existing we accept our life uh as all and enough distinguished
(18:24) things as they are from the things we might wish or imagine them to be so my
(18:29) prescription based on this vague nonsense because humans are unguided they require guidance maximum force from
(18:36) the state can lend itself to maximum results people ought to accept things as they are and that requires ending all
(18:43) charity to avoid giving them false hope and that is good tenant three ethical
(18:49) values are derived from what does anything in this have to do with humans
(18:55) require guidance and therefore an authoritative state which Andrew is a
(19:01) fan of therefore an authoritative State um should make decisions for
(19:08) humans and we should end charity and N Nana Boo Boo there's nothing about this that allows you to say that uh forcibly
(19:15) ending charity and accepting it would be bad like I want to respond to this but
(19:21) it's such an incoherent argument that I actually I actually have literally no idea how to respond to that does does
(19:29) anybody have any idea how to respond to that uh cuz I cuz I just I absolutely do
(19:37) not you know what here let's I'm gonna oh man can I get the transcript
(19:42) for this because this is so incredibly dumb
(19:49) let's see let's see if we can like plug this into something and just try to pick
(19:56) apart the argument cuz just it's so
(20:01) stupid all Christians should be required to debate you or Justin uh yeah send him
(20:06) to Justin for biblical stuff Andrew is the personification of
(20:12) reductio ad absurdum uh yeah I mean that's fair enough so now consent is not required
(20:22) either uh this website half the time it works half the time it doesn't work
(20:28) well I don't know about how I I think about three4 of the time it doesn't work it's really handy though usually it
(20:34) gives you the full transcript really fast and it gives you the time stamps too I actually use this for quite a lot
(20:42) of things these people know nothing about
(20:48) ethics I literally just wrote a 12-page project paper on bodily autonomy people
(20:54) have as the right and it should be protected so stupid yeah
(21:09) Vikings unite okay let's do this we're gonna
(21:14) exit out of the website and we're just going to try it again sometimes this
(21:26) works there are other websites for this but
(21:32) usually oh man that's usually the one I
(21:40) use a lot of these aren't actually free you
(21:54) know uh yep literally yep that's a scam um
(22:00) um these are all sponsored so obviously don't trust the sponsored ones wait I think I've used this one before though
(22:07) no never mind I I lied about that comb oh I I think I have used this one
(22:15) though coming okay yeah that was quick for whatever reason so what's he what's
(22:21) he saying because maximum force from the state can lend itself maximum force from the state okay maximum Force
(22:29) all right um so let's plug this we're going to do this on chat GPT
(22:37) um evaluate this argument and tell me if it's
(22:44) good so we're going to start
(22:50) with somebody criticized this point
(23:01) by saying this okay so we're going to go through what he said
(23:10) um okay my prescription based on this is and and that is good okay so here's
(23:19) the response boom okay this is obviously not very
(23:24) scientific but like I literally everything said uh was
(23:31) so incoherent the criticism you provided is not as strong or coherent argument
(23:37) against the original claim let's break it down oh man The Original Point argues
(23:43) that humans are part of nature shaped by unguided Evolution and that nature is self-existing not the product of divine
(23:50) okay I didn't really get what that meant but okay there we go it also emphasizes an acceptance of reality as it is rather
(23:57) than relying on wishful thinking okay I wonder if I wonder if that's a knock against the description that faith is
(24:04) the Hope for things not seen or whatever I'm not I'm not sure but who
(24:10) knows um okay evaluating the criticism the criticism seems to misunderstand or
(24:16) deliberately distort the original argument let's break it down because humans are unguided they require guidance uh yeah it said that evolution
(24:24) is an unguided process there's no like thology or man behind the curtain so I
(24:29) got that so this is a nonsecretor it doesn't follow just because humans evolved okay maximum force from the
(24:36) state can lend itself to maximum results uh yeah like this is might makes
(24:42) right the ends justify the means type of stuff this is an assertion without evidence what does maximum results mean
(24:49) results can be good or bad depending on the criteria history shows that authoritarian Force often leads to
(24:54) oppression suffering and inefficiency rather than positive out comes uh yes so what I don't know if
(25:02) we'll see this tactic from Andrew I suspect but they literally just always go oh yeah but communism was bad as if
(25:09) communism is um secular humanism it was very much secular but the idea that it
(25:15) upheld any of these any of the the goals or virtues or
(25:21) whatever in that uh Manifesto is just obviously false because it's authoritarian and top down it's very
(25:29) much undemocratic and I don't know I don't know what the secular humanist Manifesto has to say about um uh
(25:36) Democratic participation but whatever people ought to accept things as they are and that requires ending all charity
(25:43) to avoid giving them false hope okay I kind of get what he meant by that
(25:49) now um that yeah so if we shouldn't hope
(25:54) for if we shouldn't if we shouldn't have false hope but I mean this the the idea that
(26:03) um uh where is it um yeah not relying on wishful
(26:11) thinking charity and Welfare that's not wishful thinking that's that's a a
(26:16) deliberate attempt to address um hardships taking it away
(26:22) doesn't that that doesn't remove wishful thinking you like deliberately know what
(26:27) the what the kind of outcome here is going to be Pearson what's your opinion on Matt D
(26:34) Hunty leaving the debate against Andrew um I don't know if I were Matt I I think
(26:40) leaving was kind of a punk move he could have just stayed there and said you
(26:45) obviously have no interest in debating this actual topic so let's just let's
(26:51) just talk about whatever like I don't know just just nothing apparently so I
(26:57) don't know um but anyways getting back to this um
(27:02) the assumption that charity provides false hope is unfounded charity helps people survive recover and build better
(27:08) Futures yeah yeah and that is good no justification is provided for why this
(27:14) approach is quote unquote good the argument seems to rely on brute force and social Darwinism
(27:20) interesting um okay so quite a lot of that tracks with sort of what I was
(27:26) thinking I guess but yeah the problem the problem with addressing what he said
(27:32) is that it's so incoherent that what the hell are you supposed to supposed to say
(27:39) to maximum results people ought to accept wait what Inc dwarf where are the
(27:46) contradictions huh Andrew argues semantics he's incapable of playing aam's Razer to agree on the definition
(27:53) that c i I don't know what's going on things as they are and and that requires
(27:59) ending all charity to avoid giving them false hope and that is good tenant three
(28:05) ethical values are derived from human needs and interest is tested by experience this is in the uh oh God I
(28:12) literally paying any attention and that is good tenant three ethical values are
(28:17) derived from human needs and interest is tested by experience this is in the uh
(28:22) humanist Manifesto as well so my prescription based on that we ought to have an emperor he ought to be Darth
(28:28) logicist a one world global government under dark logicist supreme ruler of the
(28:33) federal peoples of Earth will maximize the responsibility granted to them thus recognizing their inherent dignity and
(28:40) that is good ethical values are derived from
(28:46) human need and interest as need and interest as tested by experience so when
(28:55) he said there should be a Supreme Overlord that makes decisions for everybody that just completely violates
(29:03) what that says right there humanists ground values and human welfare shaped by human circumstances interests and
(29:09) concerns and extended to the global ecosystem and Beyond we are committed to treating each person as having inherent
(29:15) worth and dignity and to making informed choices in a context of
(29:21) Freedom oh consonant with responsibility so here's the under uh
(29:29) I don't know if I don't know if he did this on purpose didn't read the rest of this uh or what but there so here goes
(29:37) the uh point about forcibly uh turning women into uterus factories from earlier
(29:44) um and uh and it also completely dispels the
(29:50) thing he was talking about earli or just a second ago about well there should be Darth supremacist or whatever he said
(29:57) who makes decisions for everybody and that would be good oh
(30:04) man if there is no consent you have the right to defend yourself no
(30:11) contradictions if there is no consent you have the right to defend
(30:17) yourself um even if there isn't consent you still have the right to defend yourself so there's no contradiction I
(30:24) think I see what you're saying and yeah that would be that would be fine but it's not like there is no con or would
(30:30) that are you are you arguing for I don't understand like what you're arguing for
(30:36) or against Incarnation sorry if someone does something without my consent
(30:42) depending on the ACT I have the right to defend myself accordingly see common in civil law yeah I mean that's that's
(30:48) totally fine um I'm trying
(30:54) to I'm trying to think of
(30:59) like perhaps it's not in the secular humanist Manifesto but I mean if I was going to
(31:06) start a new country I wouldn't the the secular humanist Manifesto wouldn't be
(31:12) the constitution of it it's just a it's just a philosophical framework by which you
(31:17) then go about doing that what I would do is I would take pretty much what the United States Constitution and Bill of
(31:24) Rights say I would modify them a little bit and I would there are maybe things I would add to it you know but he's he's
(31:32) treating this as if it's a legal document I think that's one of the biggest problems whereas that's
(31:38) absolutely not um what it is and the way he's trying to go about using the logic
(31:45) of it to make prescriptions is just really obviously so stupid
(31:54) um yeah because I mean more broadly like talking like speaking on religion or
(32:00) whatever or people's freedom to do like you know as they please you I I'm very
(32:05) much a believer in you have the right to do and exercise whatever rights you want
(32:12) or have granted that they don't violate other people's like in the United States we have freedom of religion uh even if
(32:20) even if the United States all of a sudden became like a Christian Nation if I started my own uh denom of
(32:28) Christianity and my denomination said um kill everybody who uh is named Andrew
(32:34) Wilson then uh would Andrew Wilson simply accept that um and that that it
(32:40) is good and that I have the right to exercise it no because uh the system
(32:47) ought to stop you from like you you without just rambling too much it's
(32:53) the very simple the very simple example is your right to to swing your fist ends
(32:59) at my face you can do that anywhere at any time in whatever manner you want so
(33:05) long as that doesn't happen so anyways moving on tenet four life's fulfillment
(33:12) emerges from Individual participation in the service of human ideals you still have no objective morality if you're
(33:18) talking about me then um okay but like literally neither do you so I don't know
(33:25) nobody does you can't derive an not from an is so there is no objective morality that's even possible my prescription
(33:31) based on this we ought to occasionally beat random citizens to death [ __ ] I don't know what he's talking about thus
(33:37) recognizing their inherent dignity and that is good tenant four oh
(33:44) no
(33:51) wait this guy's back Yeah ironic inappropriate comments
(33:58) I just you're you're never going to be able to say anything on my channel sorry or life's fulfillment emerges from
(34:03) Individual participation in you neglect that the law was informed by Christian
(34:08) ethics what law like if you're talking about the Constitution uh the the Bible
(34:14) violates almost every uh right in there there's there is no right to privacy in
(34:21) Christianity um Christianity criminalizes thought crimes Christianity
(34:27) pretty clearly says um that I know you guys pretend the Old Law doesn't apply but you still believe in the Ten
(34:32) Commandments Ten Commandments uh the first five Commandments are completely uh irreconcilable with the First
(34:39) Amendment of the United States so no I mean it it it doesn't AB
(34:47) absolutely none of it comes from a Christian ethic at all a lot of it came from people who happened to be
(34:53) Christians but no in the service of human ideals my prescription based on
(34:59) this did okay once again and that is good tenet four life's fulfillment emerges from Individual participation in
(35:06) the service of human ideals my prescription based on this we ought to occasionally beat random citizens to
(35:12) death with hammers thereby reinforcing the value of the preciousness of human life forly transmitting wonder and awe
(35:20) via the hammer and that so we got to kill people to uh get
(35:27) across the idea that life is precious that's actually his argument so no you
(35:33) don't get to go around um inflicting your will on other people the manif even if the manifesto didn't say that which
(35:41) you can I think you can pretty clearly interpret it as that it does uh again this isn't a legal
(35:47) document this isn't a list of prohibitions it's just a framework for
(35:53) how to um guide and come up with and think about reasonable re reasonable um
(36:00) prescriptions I guess his voice is literal sandpaper
(36:05) yeah um what else is going
(36:16) on I'm pretty sure Wilson is who I think he is yeah he is a piece of [ __ ] yeah that is good 10et five humans are social
(36:24) by nature and Find meaning in relationships my prescription based on this we ought to eliminate all those who
(36:30) believe in violent conflict Revolution there or or sorry who believe in violent conflict resolution thereby making sure
(36:37) we eliminate violent conflict we call this the Paradox of violent conflict and
(36:42) that is good last
(36:47) working is he an anarchist because that's literally like if you go back and read um
(36:55) um oh [ __ ] um guys who wrote Leviathan Thomas Hobbs
(37:02) yeah I don't know why that I couldn't think of it if you read Thomas Hobbs um
(37:07) Leviathan his idea is literally that the state should have a monopoly on violence
(37:13) it shouldn't be the Hatfields and The McCoys um Doling out justice as they see
(37:18) fit the state should have the absolute authority to do that and when other people try to enact or try to uh invoke
(37:28) their own sense of justice often times they are punished now there are times where like you know a father is shooting
(37:34) somebody that like I don't know Abus their kid or something like they may they may get a a a a manslaughter charge
(37:41) and only serve like six months or something like that it's like it's like it's it's understandable but by and
(37:47) large no that that actually is what the United States um is so I'm just curious Andrew Wilson I
(37:55) don't know if he's one of these it wouldn't surprise me if he's a sovereign citizen based on other things
(38:01) I've heard him say but I I don't know if that actually is what he believes in or not
(38:07) but um so I feel like what's my new book
(38:12) about facts that aren't true facts aren't true it's like it's like
(38:17) 120 uh myths misconceptions old wives tales and rumors so there's a section on
(38:23) the first section is uh the human body so like junk met IAL advice and just
(38:28) things about us that aren't true like we only have five senses you need eight glasses of water a day you only use 10%
(38:34) of your brain I can't remember any others off the top of my head next section is
(38:39) history culture and geography so you know uh the Great Walls visible from space no it isn't Native Americans were
(38:46) Hunter gathers no they weren't there's some stuff in the Bible in there like Adam and Eve ate an apple it doesn't say
(38:52) they ate an apple um uh but they also it's impossible that they could could
(38:57) have eaten an apple CU they didn't exist in that part of the world in the uh time frame in which the story is written
(39:03) there's a section on animal myths there's a section on nature and then there's a miscellaneous section so it's
(39:09) a pretty good book PP is correct the manifesto makes no moral claims um yeah yeah I mean
(39:18) nobody ever I don't know it's it's not supposed to it's literally just a
(39:24) framework for uh building better societies which is like a moral goal but
(39:31) I would say it's normative these are the sort of normative standards or whatever that you can go by but I don't know if
(39:38) it's meant to be all-encompassing or what anyways to benefit Society
(39:43) maximizes individual happiness so my the descriptor here is right now Millions
(39:48) suffer from inequality my prescription is we should just eat nachos and that is good
(39:59) sorry after Society maximize and that is good last working to benefit Society
(40:05) maximizes individual happiness so my the descriptor here is right now Millions
(40:10) suffer from inequality my prescription is we should just eat nachos and that is good
(40:17) now that's I mean that's like these aren't deductive arguments they're not
(40:22) arguments at all um and maybe they're not supposed to be because they're prescriptions but they're not justified
(40:28) prescriptions he's just he's just being a performative troll and that's really all I see from have seen from him in
(40:36) this at least I can refute all these prescriptions using Christian ethics Craig's unable to refute any of them no
(40:44) you can't using his own standard that standard is humanism based on this Manifesto again do you see the problem
(40:51) unless he just makes it up as he goes which is what he's going to do and that's why Christian ethics are superior thus destroying the entire ideology he
(40:58) hasn't explained like how Christian ethics work or what they're based on or anything like that g of secular humanism
(41:04) if Craig moves away from this document he's admitting defeat something he knows a lot about the advantages of Christian
(41:11) ethics is that it can provide a standard which is unchanging for what people ought do the Christian ethic is
(41:18) literally it's it's literally the Bible 2.0 so you can't appeal to God because
(41:23) God is capricious and changes uh what his desires are and those things are
(41:29) going to change in the future too because there's going to be a Rapture apparently not just descriptions of what
(41:34) they are doing Craig's moral framework necessarily must change by its own admission which is why Society hasn't
(41:41) adopted it and won't adopt it they don't know what it will be in another 20
(41:47) years 15 years 200 years they have no idea as society's change become more
(41:54) complex and as as new issues come about we it makes sense that you would change
(42:02) the way you do things like for example um Peterson tried to steal man
(42:08) Andrew hasn't given a position yet so there's nothing for me to steal man at this moment but like for example there
(42:14) are hunter gatherer tribes I've talked about this with people I I don't I don't really do abortion debates but I've I I
(42:22) did talk about this one time with some prolifer person but they said um
(42:28) or well I said uh there are these um nomadic hunter gatherer tribes that live
(42:33) in places like Papo New Guinea um and what happens is if if a woman
(42:41) gives birth to twins they she has to kill one of them because she can't support both of them
(42:47) at the same time and keep up with the group but it's only by living in a group that they are even able to survive and
(42:54) so it's a it's a horrible thing but I've never met anybody that really that
(43:00) actually thinks that that's actually morally incorrect um for her to do right
(43:07) now uh we don't live in a world like that today so there's no reason why uh
(43:14) anybody should practice infanticide there's there really aren't any good just uh justifiable reasons for
(43:22) that Andrew's in the chat bring him up I don't have any sort of way I don't see
(43:28) them in here um I don't have any sort of way to bring people on for this so sorry
(43:34) there are now four versions because I wrote one more should we have I don't
(43:40) know 5,000 Craig 10,000 I don't know the humanist Manifesto can be interpreted
(43:45) any way you want I just demonstrated that by so can the Bible like what there's thousands of denominations
(43:52) interpreting it how I wanted to and can't even be used to refute bad prescriptions given by by bad people
(43:57) like Andrew Wilson based on the humanist Manifesto itself so what are we even doing here my Society has produced obvious
(44:05) good results on so on Society for Millennia including the fact that all societies which currently are considered
(44:11) the best are using my moral framework and not his I that's just literally
(44:18) false there's I where is it
(44:25) um the here we go high religiosity and societal
(44:32) dysfunction in the United States during the first decade of the 20th century um this is more of a global thing The
(44:38) Chronic dependence of popular religiosity upon dysfunctional psychos
(44:43) sociological conditions so I mean there are studies out there that you can find
(44:49) um that rank countries based on their like Global developmental index or something I can't remember exactly what
(44:56) it's called um and they find that now it's the more secular countries Iceland Sweden Norway Finland um Etc that score
(45:05) better in all of those metrics so I don't know what to tell you none is
(45:12) in not one as in zero societies on Earth are run off the humanist Manifesto if
(45:18) Craig claims the manifesto itself is it um that might kind of sort of be true um
(45:25) but like take the United States it's a secular Republic um so it's not based on
(45:31) the the secular humanist Manifesto because it was written like 150 years
(45:37) later um but it is based on a uh secular rational Enlightenment ethic so
(45:45) necessary to humanism or its doctrines then again what the hell is humanism and how do we know what it is how do we know
(45:51) what we're supposed to do with it if we don't even have a document which describes it then how can we understand how it works if Craig claims we can use
(45:58) things outside the manifesto he also again loses unless he can describe how
(46:04) that is humanism and how my prescriptions are not humanism which is clearly defined with well um I mean I
(46:12) would say that pretty much everything a lot of things you argued for were authoritarian
(46:19) in nature and uh the secular humanist Manifesto pretty sure recognizes
(46:24) Humanity's cooperative um nature and so that doesn't lend itself well to um
(46:31) authoritarian top- down rule but also there was stuff about yeah informed consent in here that uh you were clearly
(46:38) violating so with this Manifesto I've been talking about and for the millionth
(46:44) time the the manifesto is not a list of uh dos and do Nots that's not at all
(46:51) what it is so uh even it's not really designed to do what you're talking about
(46:56) out it's just it's just a way of guiding um it's it's a way to guide uh better
(47:04) and rational thinking I I guess also I just want to finish with this Craig
(47:10) doesn't know what a straw man is I think first first thing out of his mouth is going to be Andre straw maning me okay
(47:18) which he also doesn't understand uh what adom he doesn't understand what a lot of these terms mean I'm giving a he hasn't
(47:24) even talked yet position based and as far as I know they've never debated maybe they have but on that's pretty
(47:31) wild to go first and say and to tell people what your opponent is doing when
(47:37) they haven't even talked yet criptions so I can't actually be straw Manning Craig because these are my views they're
(47:43) not your views he'll say I'm strawmanning humanism but I'm literally reading line by line than giving
(47:49) prescriptions based on reason Andrew that doesn't mean that you're actually intelligent enough to
(47:55) give uh coherent arguments in regards to its tenants so I I don't really know what the problem is
(48:02) Craig will not be able to refute a single prescriptive claim I have made by using his Manifesto all of my prescriptive claims are humanist claims
(48:09) this is why humanism is the Flat Earth of ethical systems and that's what Craig
(48:15) is you're a moral flat [Applause]
(48:24) earther I'm not I'm not interested in Craig's opening statement but I don't
(48:29) know what do they what do they do do they just do like timed rebuttal or do they do cross examination or what do
(48:35) they do a future where our children are taught to text and in the modern world secular humanis gentlemen well kick it
(48:43) into the 60-minute open dialogue the floor is all yours yeah so uh if you don't mind open dialogue just really
(48:49) sucks especially with a guy like Andrew you have to do cross-examination so that
(48:55) people can't just deflect and can't and can't do whataboutism it's I everybody does them
(49:03) uh or well it's every how do I want to say this
(49:09) um the it it's just naturally going to happen with almost anybody uh because
(49:15) you know you're trying to win a debate so the more the more you can avoid um
(49:22) being interrogated and then just push it back to the other person the better you
(49:27) perform but it's just so incredibly dishonest there's a reason why in our legal systems they set them up that way
(49:35) because they're trying to get at uh the truth or they're trying to get um at
(49:40) least an an honest uh testimony so that's why the cross-examination is
(49:45) there you're not allowed to do those kinds of things or you get held in contempt or something like
(49:52) that um okay mind if I ask a quick question uh do you have a copy of humanism 3 no
(50:00) you don't you do follow humanism 3 uh it's a framework yes okay it is your framework uh he said it's aame can you
(50:08) using the document of humanism 3 debunk a single prescriptive statement that I make well your prescriptive statements
(50:15) were just something you made up based on your personal interpretations of it and so SEC humanism yeah I was in the middle
(50:21) of talking Andrew if you want to come down while I'm talking that'd be great thank you um yeah what you did was you
(50:26) said I think this is what the manifesto says so therefore I'm going to interpret it this way and bring my own prescriptions well Andrew your
(50:32) prescriptions are your prescriptions and that is literally a straw man because it is your own interpretation of um of
(50:40) secular humanism which doesn't align with what everyone else thinks secular humanism
(50:47) is that's an O I mean I wouldn't call that a strong man but I I I do get what
(50:52) he means by that you claim because Andrew's Andrew is not speaking like to
(50:57) me a straw man is when you try to tell people what somebody else is thinking not when you tell people your
(51:03) interpretation of what their position sort of is I don't know what an adom and
(51:10) things are trust me I debate flaters all the time that's uh but yeah I don't have to argue against your personal
(51:16) prescriptions we can just talk about what secular humanism is better for society none of the things that you mentioned are about Society they're just
(51:24) what you don't like about secular humanism um what I'm just going to ask you is very simple humanism humanism
(51:30) yeah what I'm going to ask you Andrew is very how long you going to filibuster dude I just you he talked he talked for
(51:36) it hasn't even been 90 seconds about to ask a question if you you can calm down and let me finish my sentence then you
(51:42) can resp right what I'm going to ask you chill out Craig stop sping Craig what I'm going to asking Craig I'm like three
(51:48) words away from Craig stop sping calm down get to the question like the way
(51:53) Andrew is just trying to rage bait and actually ejecting here because Andrew
(51:58) wants to do anything other than have an honest conversation so as Craig is
(52:03) trying to ask him a question that he has to respond to he just goes you're sperging you're spering you're spering
(52:08) you're spering question go ahead Craig again as the as the where is it
(52:15) thumbnail no where is it says this is not a serious person so
(52:22) anyways sometimes he's funny but need Cal down Craig if you need a moment to
(52:27) like take a breath that's absolutely F this is a great time to ask the question what I'm goingon to ask you Andrew is because you failed to do that in your
(52:33) opening could you explain to us why Christianity is better ah very good for
(52:38) society um instead of just attacking your own views God I hate
(52:45) ANW so let's make this really simple right so Craig says here he says well
(52:51) that's your interpretation of the humanist so he's not answering the question at all Manifesto you see the problem
(52:57) see this is why you have to do cross-examination everybody's going to have an interpretation of the humanist
(53:02) Manifesto thus if everybody has an interpretation of the humanist Manifesto including me I we can make prescriptions
(53:09) based on it Craig or you could just have a system that's Democratic right um there are literal Nazis in the United
(53:17) States who have the right to vote but um we don't we don't say well democracy
(53:24) means everybody gets a voice therefore if if you're a Nazi you should be able to tell everybody what they have what
(53:30) what they should do no um they we we have a system that works by it's not
(53:37) exactly majority rule the way ours work the way ours works and there are I mean there are arguments against like that
(53:44) say like pure democracy is not good or whatever Andrew does not believe in democracy uh I kind of had a feeling
(53:50) yeah and we're like we're a different kind of democracy we're a republic but whatever um but no it what he's doing is
(53:57) just very stupid it's it's like a straw man and a slippery slope um and and and
(54:06) just a complete failure to understand how the how the thing actually works or what it is designed to do or what it's
(54:13) not designed to do is just so bad but yeah he he like saying oh democracy well
(54:19) that means if one person thinks something then everybody has to go along with it no absolutely not so now I'm
(54:24) making prescriptions based on the human Manifesto for what Society okay you are asking
(54:31) about I think the problem maybe he's not doing this
(54:37) intentionally what it seems like Andrew is doing and I see a lot of people doing this is I think he is an authoritarian person
(54:46) he he he wants an authoritarian ethic and so what he says is well I'm applying
(54:53) my view about the way things should be author arianism to yours and they're oh
(54:59) well now all of a sudden you can't say that it that it works the way you want it to you're not understanding it uh
(55:06) from the perspective of the other person Andrew Christianity I told you that
(55:12) Christian ethics are better for society because I can refute the prescriptions made in the humanist Manifesto that I
(55:19) just made in the humanist Manifesto you Craig cannot refute a single
(55:25) prescription I made off a single tenant in the humanist manifest not even attempting to deal with Craig's question
(55:32) using your own Manifesto I actually forgot Craig's question he said how is it that Christianity is better or
(55:38) something like that do you understand that yes Andrew I completely understand so doesn't that have an in society
(55:44) entailment a societal entailment Craig would you like me to answer the question or are you just going to talk when I talk no don't answer the question ask
(55:50) him the question you asked him can't wait go ahead um do you need a minute to calm down it's fine we can take two
(55:55) minutes and you can it's fine yeah get to the answer please yeah so again um what you haven't done is explain why
(56:02) Christianity is better you just said I think it's better because I don't like secular humanism that's not explaining
(56:08) why Christianity what ethics what morals about Christianity make it better for society what you've done is simply
(56:14) attack secular humanism you haven't given me a single reason why Christianity specifically is better what
(56:21) you said is Christianity is better because I don't like these things about secular humanism
(56:26) and I want you to tell me why these things about secular humanism is bad but Andrew you aren't here to attack secular
(56:32) humanism you're here to defend Christianity so I mean like to be fair
(56:38) he can do both I think it's fine but he does I I think you do need to do both
(56:45) instead of just one and he's only just done one you failed to do it in your intro so can you just give me a single
(56:51) reason specifically without attacking secular I I predict that he's going to
(56:56) say because I have a a framework that never changes or something like that a reason why Christianity is the thing an
(57:03) objective standard that doesn't change is better for society tell me what ethics what morals yeah because when I
(57:09) make prescriptions based on a humanist Manifesto I can debunk those
(57:14) prescriptions using what this is what a [ __ ] loser Christian ethics you can't
(57:19) debunk those prescriptions I mean he's such a [ __ ] crybaby this like he's
(57:25) basically throwing a tantrum um just being like no I'm not going to do that
(57:31) it reminds me of a lot of students I I taught in the past yet you you just ask him to do the simplest imaginable thing
(57:38) no I'm not going to do that using the humanist Manifesto then that's why it's better okay here I'll show you let's
(57:45) give you an example if we can go through these we can get through well that' be wonderful yeah because you know what I would like to hear is reasons why
(57:51) Christianity is better not reasons why you dislike secular humanism this isn't about feeling this
(57:56) let's do this perhaps so that we're not talking past each other are you willing to steal man my argument here Can you
(58:03) steal man it you haven't given one Craig well or um Andrew I mean the your argument would
(58:11) be based on um your particular version of Christianity which is um which
(58:16) again can you still man my argument Craig which argument the one I just made
(58:21) Craig your your argument is he didn't make an argument you don't like SEC humanist M uh these are the things I
(58:27) don't like about secular human like if he gave an argument it was I can
(58:34) debunk the prescriptions I made um on your uh based on your um Manifesto using
(58:41) Christian ethics there now Steelman me you can't Steelman that you haven't said
(58:46) anything Andrew listen so I going I'm going to say second humanism can like the only way to steal man it would just
(58:52) be to repeat what he said you believe that you can do this thing but otherwise there's nothing to steal man do these
(58:58) things and that means that secular humanism is bad that's what you said Andrew you have given me a list of
(59:05) things that you think you can prescribe based on the humanist Manifesto right that's what you've done correct uhhuh
(59:11) right so therefore you are saying well these are prescriptions that I think I can give based on secular humanism why
(59:17) do I think Christianity is better what's my argument Christian you haven't you haven't said yet no he hasn't said yet
(59:23) except that he can debunk the prescriptions but it hasn't gone past that said what You' said Andrew is that
(59:30) Christianity can debunk these things but you haven't explained how it can debunk them okay give me specifics related to
(59:35) Christianity debunk the things about secular humanism you don't like so far you've given me no reasons why
(59:41) Christianity is better Greg I'll do it the prescription for one do you agree that that the first tenant for secular
(59:47) humanism is knowledge of the world is derived by observation experimentation and rational analysis uh that's what I
(59:53) said in if we go back to the slide which you didn't present any it's uh why why do I need to pres have a slid you so
(59:59) anyway yeah because one of us prepares for the arguments the other one you know I didn't prepare for the arguments
(1:00:04) because they have a slideshow yeah Andrew you've done a million debates like this this is my second I thought I'd do some research and prepare and you
(1:00:10) know give something for the audience to look at but you know for crying out loud just I'm waiting for your argument but
(1:00:16) you I just I just want to make sure my prescription to that Craig is the birth rate is low therefore all women must be
(1:00:23) forcibly bred and experiments must be conducted on them to maximize fertility
(1:00:28) and thereby maximize human flourishing because science and that is good now Craig that's what I read from tenant one
(1:00:36) right can you use any of the tenants in Secor the the Andrew you're being asked
(1:00:43) to debunk your own prescription using your Christian ethic the humanist Manifesto 3 to debunk that prescription
(1:00:49) or tell me why that prescription's bad so still no reasons why Christianity is better that's what I'm asking here what
(1:00:55) you're saying is okay yeah Craig is actually doing fairly well explain why this is good yet to hear because okay
(1:01:02) let me expl you said you can debunk that you Christianity then all explain yes so under Christian ethics forcibly locking
(1:01:09) up women and doing horrible things to them would be a violation of God's law it would be a violation of Jesus
(1:01:16) Christ's law to man so because of that Christians would say no you can't what
(1:01:22) like the Golden Rule because there's nothing in the Bible that says that you can't do these kinds of things Jesus
(1:01:27) never spoke he never said one bad thing of any of the again they can just say um
(1:01:35) that uh well well we live in a New Covenant so you know you can point to you can point to things that Christians
(1:01:40) think are bad but which are found in the Old Testament um and are supposedly given by God and it says that the law
(1:01:47) will never ever change etc etc but uh Jesus never spoke out against any of
(1:01:52) these things apart from um I suppose you could say the Golden Rule but the golden
(1:01:58) rule is not uniquely Christian it's found in Buddhist ethics which are 600 years older than
(1:02:04) Christianity so I I I don't know I don't knowbly breed
(1:02:12) and experiment on them you're not allowed to do that Greg this secular humanist Manifesto like I said before is
(1:02:19) not literally a list of Dos and do Nots but it says that uh people have to make
(1:02:24) informed choices and have to have consent um and and and have the right to
(1:02:30) consent so uh no you don't get to do this to people even under the secular
(1:02:37) humanist view now Craig I just gave you a demonstration of how Christianity
(1:02:43) would debunk this now Craig can you use the humanist Manifesto to do it great let's do it well so your prescription is
(1:02:50) a straw man of secular humanism it's right I can explain why
(1:02:57) right CU secular humanism doesn't what is what is he
(1:03:03) doing he's a chain smoker so he's not allowed to when he's in here so I think he's I think he's actually like tweaking
(1:03:09) pretty hardcore they does you you've gone um that there's a low birth rate therefore we have to do this secular
(1:03:15) humanism doesn't say there's a low birth rate it you know read the prescript read the tenant again for
(1:03:21) me it says knowledge in the world is derived by observ ation experiment and
(1:03:27) rational analysis and then what was your prescription my prescription based on my interpretation of this is that the birth
(1:03:33) rate is low therefore all women must be forcibly bred experiments must be conducted on them to maximize fertility
(1:03:40) and therefore maximize human flourishing because science and that is good so
(1:03:45) you're saying that second humanism makes a low birth rate no I'm saying that the interpretation here prescriptively and
(1:03:51) what I'm reading is that this prescription would not in any way counter that tenant well the fact that there's
(1:03:58) low birth rates isn't a bad thing it's not low birth rates it's lower birth rates um is locking women up and
(1:04:04) breeding them a bad thing would that's not a bad thing or it is a bad thing when I'm in the middle of a sentence
(1:04:10) explaining something is causing harm and they wouldn't do that um a lower birth rate doesn't necessarily mean that
(1:04:16) things are bad it just means that there is less people than having lots of people now an extremely large birth rate
(1:04:23) has many problems um so we can look at what large birth rates caused poverty um
(1:04:28) you know broken families people being homeless um you know lots of things like that so there's no reason secular humanism would if there is a low birth
(1:04:35) rate go and then lock flishing and having uh I have a feeling the back and forth is going to be kind of unwatchable
(1:04:42) but from family and societal problems from having too many people around so you have come up with your prescription
(1:04:48) which is a prescription I don't agree with so I don't have to accept your prescription yeah okay so so if I don't
(1:04:55) have to accept your prescription I don't even have to debunk it that is your prescription and it's not what any
(1:05:00) secular humanism would say that's pretty fair in fact that prescription is a logical impossibility based in secular
(1:05:07) humanism because it includes doing harm and secular humanists would not do something that includes harm so Andrew
(1:05:13) whether you realize it or not right around here is like the part that I watched when this was live and Andrew
(1:05:19) says something like well what if secular humanists decide to start just rounding people up and throwing them into prisons
(1:05:26) then what it's like and whether your audience realizes it or not that prescription that you have come from
(1:05:31) your interpretation is a straw man of secular humanism a prescription to straw man your prescription is because your
(1:05:38) prescription is based on the interpretation that no secular humanism Strat or less Paul if I could only have
(1:05:45) if I could only have one I would have a a strat would come to the conclusion of it is a logical impossibility that
(1:05:51) secular humanists would lock people up and do experiments on them so to think that a um as humanist manifest well I
(1:05:57) wouldn't say it's a logical impossibility that they would do it but it would be in violation of the principles of it um you know like math
(1:06:07) Andrew does this other thing where he where he he starts saying like who decides uh how
(1:06:13) to uh interpret or how do I want to say like implement the secular humanist
(1:06:18) Manifesto idea or whatever um because well what if people start doing things
(1:06:25) like locking people up or like forcibly breeding women or whatever people are
(1:06:30) capable of uh doing that and we are still capable of saying that they are
(1:06:36) wrong it's like math um I'm not saying that secular humanism is objective or
(1:06:41) anything um although I could kind of make the case that it is um but math
(1:06:46) certainly seems to be yet people do math incorrectly from time to time and it's
(1:06:52) like well and but there's also like there's no person declaring how math is
(1:06:58) to be done or how science is to be done or how um secular humanism ought to be
(1:07:04) implemented or anything like that again Andrew I think is and desires
(1:07:09) authoritarian Rule and so he keeps applying that worldview he has to it uh
(1:07:16) to the to his uh to what he's debating against and saying like see it uh it
(1:07:21) can't account for the way I would do my worldview Therefore your world World viw
(1:07:26) um how I would impose my worldview kind of upon your worldview and and so
(1:07:33) therefore it's wrong or something Stalin was a secular humanist
(1:07:38) no could include that as a prescription means that you have no clue what secular humanism is and that's fine if you don't
(1:07:45) know what secular I just let you ramble for rational analysis this is a descriptive claim correct mhm okay can
(1:07:52) do do we make prescriptive claims off of descriptive claims if you want if you want so if you can't derive a not from
(1:07:59) an is um so that's why it's normative and we can't drive a not from an is
(1:08:04) under the Christian ethic either God is good why why ought we follow
(1:08:10) um first of all the arbitr like just arbitrarily saying that God is good or
(1:08:16) that God's Commandments are good is no less arbitrary than saying maximizing
(1:08:21) human well-being and flourishing is um object L good it just there there's
(1:08:29) there's nothing unique about that now the only thing they can do is just claim that God by definition is that okay we
(1:08:35) will just arbitrarily Define uh something else to be that there you go
(1:08:41) if I were a humanist and I read that who whose interpretation would it be up to as to how it was applied or what the
(1:08:47) prescription was hang on hang onig was I done calm down you ask the
(1:08:52) question what I'm asking you specifically is if if it is the case that the person reading it is going to
(1:08:58) be the person who I don't like telecasters uh Nicholas sorry makes the
(1:09:04) prescription Okay then if I make a prescription here and it's not debunked
(1:09:09) by any of the rest of the humanist Manifesto and you're going to some external Source in your case well you
(1:09:15) see uh this a logical impossibility because secular humanist wouldn't do that it doesn't tell us [ __ ] Craig I'm
(1:09:22) giving you a prescription based on your first tenant hang on stop based on your very first tenant I need you to use the
(1:09:30) actual Manifesto itself to tell me how it conflicts with that prescription what you're doing is you're saying I don't
(1:09:37) like that prescript because that's nobody gives a [ __ ] what you like show me in the humanist Manifesto where it is
(1:09:43) that it actually debunks this prescription or says this prescription is wrong or says this prescription isn't
(1:09:51) humanist simply using the manifesto against itself showing it to be arbitrary any moral or ethical framework is going
(1:09:58) to be going to have arbitrarily assigned objectives and goals um Christian ethics
(1:10:04) is no different than that um you couldn't do that with Orthodoxy you
(1:10:10) absolutely can do that with Orthodoxy there are different interpretations of
(1:10:15) Orthodoxy um like literally Eastern Orthodox is is different from other branches like we had uh I always I
(1:10:23) always get the the history of this it's hard to keep track of but the the Schism
(1:10:30) that happened in like the 300s or the 400s around the Nan Creed uh and the filio or however you say that created
(1:10:37) the Schism that produced like uh what I'm pretty sure we call
(1:10:42) Catholics and then the Eastern Orthodox and then later there were other I mean there were other schisms within
(1:10:48) Orthodoxy as well so no like it's it it doesn't not have that problem Jim Bob
(1:10:55) that that stuff has uh famously and historically resulted in people killing
(1:11:01) each other over MIS over uh the differences in interpretations or inspiring them to uh do that kind of
(1:11:08) thing what I'm claiming is that that is humanism okay that is a humanist Doctrine you need to show me within the
(1:11:14) humanist Manifesto how it's not again it talks about consent and uh and a few
(1:11:21) other things so I already did that by explaining that the SEC the humanist manifest doesn't say harm it is about
(1:11:27) not doing harm and again Andrew you are going back to your own interpretation now secular humanism doesn't have one
(1:11:34) person's interpretation to take into account secular humanism is based on a collective the shared experiences we we
(1:11:41) don't take the Bible we we don't take one person we need you in the audience to remain quiet please we don't take one
(1:11:47) person's interpretation that's what we're going to stick to okay we don't go this is the thing that we say because
(1:11:54) this person wrote this and that is what we stick to as humanists we have Collective experiences we will get together and say do you write them in a
(1:12:01) Manifesto yes because that's a group of collective experien kidding you have Collective experiences and you put them
(1:12:06) in a Manifesto do you want me to answer the question or are you going to jump in and let are you going to take to answer the
(1:12:12) question well I let you talk for a while to give the question so let me your question one you put them in a
(1:12:19) thing called the humanist Manifesto which you just agreed to using this humanist Manifesto of your collective
(1:12:24) experience is I gave a prescription can you also use that human Manifesto to
(1:12:30) debunk that prescription tell me why that prescription's wrong using the manifesto itself I think you can't I
(1:12:37) think you can't do it Craig because it doesn't tell you [ __ ] it doesn't tell you anything I this is just going to go in a
(1:12:45) big circle and it is after 3 o' where I am so I don't know I'll probably like do
(1:12:51) an official like reaction thing and like get out some U more erent thoughts and
(1:12:56) it's pretty much just going to be centered around Andrew's opening statement I did like the first couple
(1:13:02) minutes of the back and forth but I don't know the the rest of this is just not particularly all that interesting at
(1:13:09) least to me so um Andrew Wilson is a troll yeah I
(1:13:15) don't know the guy I just I don't know how seriously he takes Christianity like
(1:13:20) the idea that I'd be massively surprised if he goes to church every
(1:13:30) Sunday Andrew is right in that the manifesto doesn't dive into applied ethics um yeah I don't see how that's a
(1:13:38) problem you can you can get that from somewhere else the secular humanist Manifesto also doesn't say if we should
(1:13:45) do capitalism or socialism or anarchism it doesn't say if we should do science
(1:13:53) or or anything like that so there's innumerable things that it
(1:13:58) doesn't directly um prescribe or anything like that it doesn't mean that you cannot derive them from other means
(1:14:05) even other secular
(1:14:15) means his character is literally everything Paul warns against um I mean I I don't know I don't
(1:14:23) I don't have a comment on that
(1:14:29) I'm a Christian and I always find myself agreeing with atheists and all these debates I mean even when I was a
(1:14:35) Christian I did uh fairly often too
(1:14:42) yeah when did Craig change his names to change his name to Craig I don't
(1:14:53) know why not debate him Andrew well he's very dishonest but I mean I feel like if
(1:14:58) there was a platform where it could be um it wouldn't even need to be well it would need to be moderated excuse me it
(1:15:06) would need to be moderated but it would need to be set up correctly which is uh
(1:15:12) uh with cross-examination essentially I think that that debate
(1:15:20) framework has literally always worked and it's not a trick you know that that
(1:15:25) I employ I I don't do debates unless they or I try not to do debates unless they have that um and that's not a
(1:15:32) stupid trick on my part it's just objectively the only way that you can uh
(1:15:38) or not the only way but the best way to guarantee that you'll have an honest conversation you know like when I was
(1:15:44) talking to that video I uploaded just uh two days ago or whenever it was with Big
(1:15:50) John steel you know that wasn't a moderated debate there was no cross-examination or anything like that
(1:15:55) but he's he's a genuine Earnest um uh interlocutor so there was no issue
(1:16:03) with it but some people because they're just performative [ __ ] or because
(1:16:10) they don't actually have anything to defend they just want to attack something else um because that's what
(1:16:16) gets them clicks and things like that um or they don't realize that they're doing
(1:16:21) it because they're trying to win a debate and so they just always deflect and it's it's not a tactic it's just a
(1:16:28) sad result of of whatever the situation they're put in
(1:16:34) um this this runon sentence Ran So Far that I forgot what I was talking about
(1:16:39) but basically it is possible to get that uh to to avoid the shitty debate
(1:16:45) structure but for a lot of people it's not so
(1:16:55) oh no I actually hate rebuttal Barney opening I don't really like opening statements very much either I I I do
(1:17:03) them because um it's just sort of expected of you or whatever but I'm like
(1:17:09) yeah five minute opening statement that's that's about all I feel like you need to do but I actually hate rebuttal
(1:17:18) because the time dbal it's it's it's a waste of time and it's just literally listening to one person say
(1:17:25) like you can toss out so many claims in a rebuttal and they don't get responded to
(1:17:33) now sometimes there are like response rebuttal I hate that when I see debates
(1:17:38) that are like that like well we're going to have opening statements and then we're going to have uh first rebuttal
(1:17:44) and then we're going to have second rebuttal it's like literally one person can just dishonestly throw out the a
(1:17:50) garbage heap of claims and then the other person just responds to them in turn but there there's no actual holding
(1:17:57) any idea into account during rebuttal so I actually hate
(1:18:04) rebuttal what is it that modern day debate is a massive wait why is it that MDD is a massive debate Channel and has
(1:18:11) no debate structure um I don't know Jim Bob why that
(1:18:18) is um because yeah they typically now the couple times I've wait I've only
(1:18:25) been on there once the one time I was on there we demand no wait we didn't ask
(1:18:30) for cross yeah no we didn't do cross-examination so never mind I've only been on there once but you know
(1:18:35) they have emailed me and I've said in the future um if I if I do a debate there
(1:18:41) has to be a cross-examination period oh Jim Bob while you're here I did hear you say you wanted to talk about is there
(1:18:47) thology in nature I'm fine with that we can just do it on politics Discord again because I thought that that actually
(1:18:52) went really well so I'm totally fine with that but also with the uh the uh
(1:18:58) the 2v2 debate thing on Evolution or whatever um I heard you talking about
(1:19:04) that too I had nothing to do with that James emailed Grayson and I and it came
(1:19:09) completely out of the blue um and uh it's I heard that you didn't want
(1:19:15) to have Taylor on your team so I don't know if the debate will ever go anywhere but I'm totally happy to do that too but
(1:19:20) no I I I said to James I was like there has to be we have to do do cross-examination for that
(1:19:28) so um I will I mean I've only been on modern day debate once I hope to be on
(1:19:34) there a few times in the future and I I hope to change the way or at least P try
(1:19:40) to persuade them to change the way they do things because I don't know I I actually
(1:19:47) honestly feel like the cross-examination thing is uh the only honest way to have
(1:19:53) a debate you should treat it like a court of law I feel like and we very serious people over vast
(1:20:01) stretches of time really dove into why why you know in a court of law for
(1:20:06) example it structured the way it does and there are very good reasons for that and if for nothing else it's for honesty
(1:20:14) maybe it's not as I don't know if modern debate like consciously is like well
(1:20:19) it's more entertaining if if it's kind of a free-for-all but
(1:20:25) um so it's more click it gets more clicks but I don't really believe that either because the modern day debate the
(1:20:31) moderators so often they have to be like okay well what we're going to do now is we're going to go into twom minute
(1:20:38) statements back and forth and the other person will be muted the whole time that's even worse than a free flowing
(1:20:45) discussion I think it's because their moderators aren't Debaters
(1:20:50) um uh yeah maybe maybe that's that that could have something to do with it I I
(1:20:56) don't know anything about James's background or Ryan's background um I think there's other
(1:21:03) moderators but I don't know any of the others by name but yeah like literally 5
(1:21:08) 10 minute opening statements 20 to 30 minutes of cross-examination each and then 30 minutes of open discussion and
(1:21:15) then audience questions like perfect the the other thing that kind of
(1:21:20) sucks is if you want to have audience questions you really kind of have to
(1:21:26) have almost three-hour long debates which is which is a pretty long time
(1:21:33) um well no it wouldn't have to be three but it would definitely could you do it in two 10minute opening statement that's
(1:21:40) 20 minutes 30 minutes each of Coss that's an hour and 20 minutes yeah you have you definitely have to have uh two
(1:21:46) hours so I don't know Jim Bob I'm kind of a troll in real life
(1:21:53) too oh man P Mars is here oh gez I didn't think P Mars was ever going to
(1:21:58) show his face again that was crazy after he appealed to empiricism to justify
(1:22:04) claims even claims made by Christians who claim they have a presuppositionalist framework that was
(1:22:10) so wild cross-examination is the only interesting part of the debate
(1:22:17) it's yeah I I actually typically skip opening statements audience questions
(1:22:22) are are usually kind of boring too all right I'm going to take I'll take one more question from the audience and then
(1:22:27) I'm going to get out of here
(1:23:06) H when Andrew Wilson has asked Point Blank about his definitions I've heard him say many times it's not his burden
(1:23:11) to Define what he means that's pretty sad my mom laughs at my jokes well
(1:23:19) that's good everybody in the world should be loved by at least
(1:23:26) somebody even if it's only themselves uh you're welcome John I
(1:23:33) don't know I don't know what me think I was
(1:23:39) going to do that
(1:23:46) but theocracy is just 1984 um no I mean Soviet Russia was very
(1:23:53) 1984 it was very orwellian I mean they had they had secret police that would go around listening to people and if they
(1:23:58) didn't like what they said they would execute
(1:24:04) them many were demanding you bring a Drew on but he was ad Drew I don't know
(1:24:12) who ad Drew is sorry I mean I didn't pay super close attention to the chat when I was watching the the video here
(1:24:22) sorry oh no not walking with the spirit that guy oh man you should go
(1:24:29) read that guy's comments they were so funny my question is what do you think of the tag argument you can't define God
(1:24:35) into existence there that's my argument or that's my that's my response well
(1:24:41) that's what I think of it it's lazy and
(1:24:49) stupid oh man well I said one more question so I
(1:24:54) suppose I suppose not it's it's it's unfortunate cuz it started to get interesting just a second ago P Mars
(1:25:01) planet stupid that's like literally there's no alliteration in that it's not a play on words it doesn't rhyme ah
(1:25:09) nothing dude just you're so bad you're you're so bad at everything that you do
(1:25:25) you literally have to teach this guy how to debate during the debate no P Mars you didn't teach me anything I pointed
(1:25:31) out so many contradictions in your own worldview in real
(1:25:36) time if you guys didn't catch it the there were a lot of really great moments with P Mars but I said to P Mars what if
(1:25:43) there was a religion that had a story that said the Earth stopped spinning one day would you say that that's true or
(1:25:50) false and he said I think that would be [ __ ] and then I said okay but you know the Bible says that right and he
(1:25:55) says yeah but the Bible's legit so literally he believes in a contradiction
(1:26:00) so he can't do anything with people like
(1:26:09) that planet poo poo oh jeez and this guy's intellectually about three and a
(1:26:15) half years old that's the best that's the best the other side can
(1:26:21) do Planet Poopers what if at least been funny I mean poop poop always makes you
(1:26:28) laugh I guess but it's just you're not it it's like comparing Monty Python
(1:26:35) to Family Guy it's like yeah I mean they can both make you laugh but one's really not
(1:26:44) trying Mars is clearly the superior planet Mars is kind of cool maybe maybe
(1:26:50) you can get a ticket you can go there we'll have space tourism in in a few DEC
(1:27:08) decades tag doesn't Define God into existence uh kind of does because it
(1:27:13) says the only possible way to justify transcendentals is with a God that has
(1:27:19) these characteristics wait so we know that a god with these characteristics exist exists no it's just that we Define
(1:27:26) it to have to to be the necessary thing that accounts for these characteristics so it it very very very much defines a
(1:27:34) god into existence I don't go to planets with
(1:27:40) weak magnetic fields sorry uh P Mars versus Atheism how old
(1:27:48) are you he's definitely too old to have acne but he still does so it's un
(1:27:54) fortunate okay I will see everybody later
(1:28:06) [Music]
