Title: Right vs. Left: Andrew Wilson, Jimbob & Rachel Wilson vs. TJump, Neal & Doug! ðŸ’¥ðŸ”¥

(0:01) [Music]

(0:08) [Music] wanted to do so like my view is that I

(0:14) don't care the human race as a as a concept doesn't matter what matters is the individual consciousnesses and what

(0:21) their value of life is and so if their individual selves can have a better life

(0:28) for and just end die or whatever versus causing all of them excess suffering to

(0:34) produce more humans there's no value to that there's no value if it was just something as simple as brushing your

(0:40) teeth let's just say that brushing your teeth if you told everybody they had to

(0:45) brush their teeth they continued the humanity but if they stopped for some reason they all felt happier if they

(0:51) didn't brush their teeth would you mandate that they brushed their teeth so Humanity didn't end no again there's no

(0:58) value to this Contin Humanity are they going to brush their [Â __Â ] teeth under dictator Doug is

(1:05) dictator Doug going to say you got it do this or else important question here why do you keep obsessing over this

(1:11) continuing Humanity thing why is this important well so from from my aspect from from the way that I view the world

(1:19) I don't think that you can have any of this happiness or goals or anything like this if you don't have a Humanity for

(1:25) which to achieve those things I do think ultim I do think ultimately that God had

(1:30) an edict at least from my purview that we do breed and we multiply and he wanted us to do so for a reason and I

(1:38) think that the reason is is that life is not fair and it is suffering and there is going to be one of the big problems

(1:45) kind of I see with the world this is just my view so that you understand it is that people have embraced materialism

(1:51) to the point where they will stop reproductive activities even in order to

(1:58) get what I want right now for the highest quality of life right now and I I don't think that that's a a moral good

(2:05) I don't think I can see Andrew's point and I can see T Jump's point I wanted to because I didn't hear an answer there I

(2:10) heard that God told you so but like what is the value why is God told you so not good enough well it was the the thing

(2:17) you said before that it sounded like a good answer the God told you so was just a terrible answer but T jump I got a great question for Andrew on that sure

(2:23) if if God said Andrew if God did if God told me to do what if God told me to go

(2:30) through and exterminate everything that Pine Creek loved the AK-47 is coming out

(2:37) see what your hus doing to me I'm a nice

(2:42) guy what if God told you to become trans Andrew what if we if we are though

(2:48) wouldn't that mean yeah that would be that would be let me finish my question Andrew if God actually destroyed the

(2:53) universe MH tomorrow but didn't tell anybody just poof everything's gone

(2:59) would that be bad well so the the question that you're asking we look at the purviews of what's

(3:05) logically possible Doug you have no stop it would have to go it would have to go

(3:11) through the Paradigm of what is logically possible thing people often mess up we're talking about philosophy

(3:18) especially is that logical possibility has to come from a paradigm from T Jump's Paradigm that's logically

(3:24) possible from your Paradigm it's logically possible from my Paradigm it's not actually logically possible the question becomes incoherent is it

(3:31) logically possible to create the universe out of nothing it is with uncreated energy so then it should be

(3:36) logically possible to destroy the universe into nothing well no because then that would be counter to the nature

(3:42) of the thing that I'm appealing to and remember in t jumps in t Jump's actual answer for his morality T jump stated

(3:50) that a field a space field of morality the object just simply can appeal to

(3:56) itself which is exactly what I'm doing right now why am I wrong Pine Creek Doug

(4:02) well see I think the core fundamental difference is the value one places on

(4:08) existence in itself and I think that I can agree with yeah and I think a lot of atheists would say that existence is

(4:16) neither good or bad it is what it is and so if the universe went extinct tomorrow

(4:22) that's not bad that's not good it's just is what it is I'm going to answer to this before I do can you just answer one

(4:28) thing for me and I'm sorry I know that that's actually kind of bad for but if if you just don't mind cuz we're in an

(4:33) informal panel setting you obviously Place some weight on existence and the

(4:40) continuation of existence why the [Â __Â ] do you do that man what why do you think

(4:45) I it's obvious I do because you're a right-wing conservative fanatic I've

(4:50) seen your content you love reproduction you love you think that children are

(4:55) excellent you want to see more of that in society why man why well because know there's something I'll answer your

(5:01) question it's because I disagree with t jump that I think it would be a horrible way to go to if a society would slowly

(5:10) go extinct yeah I mean you're G to have a lot of old people like just practically who's G to change my diaper

(5:17) I mean it's going to be bad and so what's that answer now though i' rather

(5:23) our planet and we just go poof we're gone I'd rather Yellowstone just blow up well before we introduce Rachel Rachel

(5:28) thanks for being patient I think AIT with that like there's almost maybe even T JP would agree

(5:35) there's almost an intuition to it right so the reason we need kids is to take care of you when you're old so they can

(5:40) change your diapers that's true though I mean that's that's not really what that's practical that's exactly that's

(5:46) literally what Doug just said he he gave an example that's true I mean that's true but he gave an example what he's

(5:52) really trying to say is he's like look I think intuitively we don't think that

(5:57) non-existence is good or else T jump why wouldn't she just go grab the 45 next to

(6:03) you and in you know what I mean it makes no sense Andrew also T jump you also have

(6:08) in your view I think you still have this the best possible world right isn't that paired to your moral Paradigm yes okay

(6:14) so is it is it possible to have a best possible world without a knower uh a knower you mean a conscious

(6:21) entity like yeah to Value it but I would say that a conscious entity who would like to continue living would be the

(6:29) best possible if consy does not want to continue living it would be better off suiciding or whatever Doug's answer was

(6:35) the reason we should have kids was because of the what would it look like

(6:41) if Society started to go out over a long prolonged period of time we' get old it be suffering unpleasant but that would

(6:47) be contradictory to I'm sorry to cut I'm so sorry to cut in t jump and I'm gonna let you get the floor again but the

(6:53) patriarchy must speak for a second and tell its wife to bring down the charger I'm sorry can you bring down my phone

(6:58) charger I appreciate that I'm so sorry go ahead BS Lewis asked why women get voice on the panel because NEP we value

(7:05) nepotism so we play a you know trouble I'm in Pine Creek stop being smug stop being smug Pine Creek stop judging me

(7:12) let me ask you if we were if we were um going EX stinct under the Christian worldview wouldn't that mean we're

(7:17) getting closer to the second coming um I'm not sure actually about

(7:23) that question well so what Doug said was that the reason he doesn't want us to stop

(7:29) having kids is because it would cause our old people to have lots of suffering but that would be contradictory to the

(7:34) example because the example is would a society who had a full life of full

(7:39) happiness including at the end they have robots to change their diapers or whatever they no none of this added

(7:45) suffering stuff that you require kids to take care of you they had a full life of all happiness essentially and then just

(7:52) didn't have kids would that be better or worse than a society that was forced to reproduce or whatever and so for my view

(7:59) I don't care whether or not we reproduce it's not it's not important whether or not we reproduce it has no value

(8:05) whatsoever what matters is whether or not we want to reproduce whether it's

(8:10) and if the children we do have if they have meaningful lives so obviously reproduction is better if we can produce

(8:17) more kids and they all have happy lives too sure and so us going through a little bit of suffering like brushing our teeth in order to produce kids who

(8:23) will live lots of happy lives sure that that I'm happy with that's a good argument but simply value valuing

(8:29) existence or valuing reproduction rates over the quality of life of the people who living now is kind of asinine but

(8:37) but T jump and we'll get to Rachel sorry Rachel um if problem Better or Worse

(8:43) does require people it seems like the first and most fundamental thing is

(8:48) existence even with force or even unpreferred methods because without the people you you can't say it's better or

(8:55) worse like Doug said it would just be a void right so system from your system

(9:00) wouldn't it follow that you would actually do uh you would violate and impose on people to maintain the best

(9:07) because it it it does it it could be seen as worse in the short term but

(9:13) that's the you have to have that as a precondition to get to anything better anyway so you need to you need to say

(9:18) procreation is is better in your system no so in my system if all conscious

(9:24) agents wanted to die and didn't want to procreate that'd be perfectly fine that would be the best of all possible worlds

(9:29) um whether or not they continue is irrelevant what matters is is do all conscious agents have the freedom to do

(9:35) the things they consent to doing so in the best of all possible worlds there's no aging you wouldn't die of old age you

(9:41) could just continue living for as long as you wanted to and so there wouldn't be like I don't imagine all conscious

(9:46) agents would suicide but if they be no new life right there probably still

(9:51) would be probably many people who would choose to reproduce yes just be slower yeah but I mean you would hit a Zenith

(9:58) if nobody ever died a what you would hit like a you would hit like a point where how could you

(10:04) possibly continue to reproduce if everybody died you know if nobody died so um in this world we have infinite

(10:11) power kind of like Gods we can just create as many worlds as we want so be a limitation works okay Rachel thank you

(10:18) so much for your patience uh welcome to the panel Flo well I just uh heard

(10:24) somebody say patriarchy so Doug said have we talked about the patriarchy yet

(10:30) and I heard you guys were talking about that and about standpoint Theory and stuff dou you brought this on yourself bro I'm I'm tapping out I'm tapping out

(10:38) should be talk on I'm super nice and harmless and totally unscary

(10:43) sheesh but uh did you guys ever sort that out what we think about the patriarchy is no I don't think we did

(10:49) Doug supports it Doug support I'm open to it we the way we left it is if we ran

(10:55) the experiment where for example women couldn't vote for 10 years and it led to better outcomes I think all of us here

(11:01) would say yeah then we should do it well but you asked the alternative um and I as the alternative as well I didn't

(11:07) think we get a clear answer from that so if we B men from voting and Society gets better would Andrew and Bob and Rachel

(11:15) admit that the patriarchy was bad well I don't think that voting is like what

(11:20) determines whether we have a patriarchy I think that's one very small part of it I know that like to the broad world they

(11:27) think that the 19th amendment was like the thing that took down the patriarchy but I wouldn't actually say that at all

(11:33) so I mean like Andrew said we could limit suffrage in lots of ways and we might have varying outcomes I personally

(11:40) am not a democracy enjoyer I don't think voting and you know representative

(11:45) republics are a very good system of government at all so I don't know if I would focus mainly on just voting I

(11:52) think there's a lot of other ways to determine like if we have a patriarchy for example all the feminists argued

(11:58) that even after they got the vote we were still living under a patriarchy and a lot of them think we still are living

(12:03) under a patriarchy I wouldn't say that but I mean even if women can't vote or

(12:08) can vote do you guys think there's like we could still have a patriarchy regardless of that I think there's a

(12:14) natural hierarchy that men do certain things in world in the world and women do certain things in the world and they fall into certain places in in civiliz

(12:22) in society and that's just how it is I also think that whatever outcome you came to with either of those two

(12:28) hypothetic iCal um whatever outcome you had and whatever system you had of of

(12:33) society or of Justice governance would still be upheld by force and this is

(12:39) Andrew's uh you know typical argument against all these people is that no matter what hypothetically you come to

(12:45) if you take the methodology that gets you the hypothetical let's say women rule the world and you get to this

(12:51) outcome where all the outcomes are better and it's beautiful that to protect that you still then appeal to

(12:57) Pure pure muscle in the end right any any type of Illusion of women's rights is going to be enforced and upheld by

(13:04) men regardless so if we have not a patriarchy if we've got an egalitarian

(13:10) or a matriarchal system it's only that way because men still decided to

(13:15) facilitate such a system if that makesense like laring it's like do you think it's bad for women to be in high

(13:21) places of power like CEOs of big corporations stuff like that yeah I do what do you what's your reasons for that

(13:28) uh well there's a lot of reasons for that one is that women do tend to be a

(13:33) lot more emotionally driven and a lot less rational um so and we're we're

(13:39) biologically programmed and if you guys are naturalists you'll actually agree with me on this point we're programmed

(13:44) for maternity there's a lot to that went into getting women to be successful at

(13:51) reproduction and being moms and you have a baby attached to you for at least 2 years after it's born you're very preg

(13:57) um vulnerable for the whole time you're pregnant the whole time you have a newborn and toddlers And so women tend

(14:03) to want to distribute everything evenly we want to make everything Fair we want to make sure commy mommies that's what

(14:10) you are yeah kinda yeah um whereas uh so like if you this is the irony right of

(14:17) all the Libertarians say we have to give women voting rights because that's freedom and we want maximum freedom and

(14:22) we want maximum Liberty but by giving women voting rights you ensure that whatever Freedom or Liberty you had is

(14:28) going to go away because women are always going to vote for a nanny state they're going to always vote for protection over Freedom they're going to

(14:35) vote for security over Liberty they're going to be risk adverse they're going to be conflict avoidant and so you're

(14:42) going to get less Liberty and less Freedom if women are voting so let me modify my question for a little bit

(14:48) let's say that look at him pretending to listen you and Andrew are similar in behaviors and yeah when women come onut

(14:54) look at him look at him look at him pretending so say so interesting

(15:00) ironically ironically ironically proof of of uh oh [Â __Â ] I just took everyone

(15:06) off um ironically proof of of the patriarchy just dug [Â __Â ] way to go why

(15:13) did he just ruin the whole [Â __Â ] panel you know this poor guy glass of wine

(15:19) yeah okay let me shift these around okay so let's say that women do vote for all those things you mentioned but Society

(15:25) ends up for 10 years and Society ends up better off longer health standards better quality of life lower poverty etc

(15:31) etc would you admit that the anti-patriarchy was good well no because

(15:37) I'm not a utilitarian and I don't do things based on outcome my moral view of the world is not based purely on outcome

(15:44) for one you can't ever just completely predict outcomes there's too many variables to say well if women vote I

(15:51) mean you can you can pose the question if we could prove it but I don't think that's let's say let's say it happened

(15:56) let's say we just let them vote and Institute all those different things you said over a period of 50 years and after 50 years the quality of life in every

(16:04) country we did this was significantly better and the quality of life in the countries that did not do this were not

(16:09) better it would depend on what you mean by quality of life because I have a whole chapter in this book the whole

(16:15) last chapter goes over the outcomes of the last 100 years of women voting and

(16:20) being de pure dead it's it's really bad like every metric of well-being that you

(16:27) guys as atheists and naturalists were oh hang on I'm sorry Pine Creek [Â __Â ] Doug I will send you a signed copy of

(16:34) the book I know you wanted to ask I'll send you the signed copy of the book why don't you calm the [Â __Â ] down Doug anyway

(16:41) back to this I'm sorry I didn't mean to cut I'm so happy I didn't have to ask it's so so I have a I have a book I like

(16:46) to reference as well it's called the better angels of our Natures by Stephen Pinker it does a pretty well analysis

(16:51) really good analysis of crime rates lower lowering of crime rates lowering of murder rates uh increasing quality of

(16:57) life happiness level um food access to Opportunities Freedom pretty much every

(17:03) standard that U most philosophers use when we're trying to establish anything in Morality has improved drastically by

(17:11) increasing all those things like a welfare state healthc care in countries that do um socialized healthare or a

(17:18) mixed economy healthare drastically beat out pretty much every privatized healthare system in existence with one

(17:24) exception which is Singapore um same with housing and assistance and like the best government

(17:32) program well the best government program that's ever done anything for anybody was the eitc the Earned Income Tax

(17:37) Credit where people essentially the government essentially just doubled people's incomes in low poverty

(17:43) conditions and it saved the lives of tens of thousands of children overnight so if we look at the data it shows the

(17:50) data that all those protectionist socialist policies benefit the lives of pretty much everybody significantly

(17:57) everywhere in the world but lead to lack of Po population it's interesting you said Singapore my wife is half

(18:03) Singaporean and they have to do drastic measures to repopulate now I don't care

(18:09) about that literally doesn't matter literally matter it's it it is relevant because what you call well-being I think

(18:15) we've established right Tom that your your goal of well-being could just be a blip in in time and then it all fades

(18:22) away and it's fine but from our view if you were to achieve well-being you would want to sustain it and to sustain it you

(18:27) need to have children but you is it better to is it better to sustain well-being and outcomes than not

(18:34) again sustain as I mentioned sustaining means nothing it literally doesn't matter if Humanity continues what

(18:39) matters is the quality of the life of the individual consciousnesses and as you need a week for that that doesn't

(18:46) make any sense time frame doesn't matter you need time if we're comparing the two extremes

(18:53) a world where everybody lives happy lives and never reproduces or a world where people are forced to reproduce and

(18:58) be slaves clearly the one where the world ends and there's no more children

(19:03) is a better option than the one where everyone's forced to have be slaves and have children the reproduction part just

(19:09) doesn't matter so whether or not we have more kids isn't a measurement on the

(19:15) happiness scale it's not a measurement on the well-being scale there is no part no not not baseden inter but I I wanted

(19:22) to jump in just because that's actually not true we have like major consequences from declining birth rates one of which

(19:28) is is we have a massive labor shortage right now we have supply chain interruptions uh we are now encouraging

(19:34) people to do assisted self-d deltion uh because we don't have enough population

(19:40) growth to sustain people it's causing massive problems in quality of life it's causing massive problems in

(19:46) interruptions of the food system the Health Care system and it's only going to get worse so that's one aspect but

(19:51) the other thing is pinker's stuff has been torn apart by a lot of people a lot smarter than me who say it's kind of

(19:58) [Â __Â ] and what I would say in response to his data is that my data shows that if you look at things like

(20:05) mental health outcomes substance abuse uh homelessness all the metrics you

(20:10) would look at for well-being for children when they grow up in broken families if they grow up in a disrupted

(20:15) family system of any kind they are at far higher risk so like all the children

(20:20) that they find in um you know inpatient mental health facilities they did a big study where like 88% of these kids come

(20:27) from homes with where there's some type of disruption the dad's not there um the parents are divorced remarried things

(20:34) like that uh the breakdown of the family unit has caused a lot of suffering a lot

(20:39) of unwell beinging for a little loss there because those aren't issues in most Western countries they just not

(20:45) that's an American isue what do you mean really so like um the most countries

(20:50) have the wellbeing of the children is significantly better than anywhere everywhere else in the world there is no

(20:56) there is no comparison everywhere wait a minute you're just saying material you're saying material conditions are

(21:02) better for kids pychological wellbe happy happiness every single Criterion

(21:07) of the psychological state of well-being of kids is better in Western Nations than anywhere else in any time period

(21:14) anywhere in history this is not eveny no we don't have any measurements for the psychological well-being of children

(21:20) across time in different parts of the world no we don't we can you show me the data of the psychological conditions of

(21:26) somebody who was born in the year 1000 ad sir the year 1000 we can actually yes because AV I'll wait yeah I'll wait you

(21:34) show me the psychological conditions can okay go ahead JP you you keep mentioning Western Nations but what about China

(21:40) with low birth rates China what what about China there are people with psychology phds that are historians that

(21:47) have done work on this stuff I've certainly read it all speculation all specul this is a republican Trope where

(21:53) they say here there is there is conclusive data the consensus in every single

(22:00) not consensus is not a conclusion why why do you guys not understand how science works so the consensus oh we

(22:07) don't know what how science Works close your close your eyes close your eyes and tell me the scientific method just tell

(22:13) me the scientific method hypothesis prediction conclusion there you go it's it's not even hard so what you guys were

(22:19) saying is wrong close almost it also depends on what you're talking about too no that is that

(22:27) that is the scientific method you guys you don't think you're wrong if you think I'm wrong that you know nothing about this say it again

(22:33) hypoth conclusion wait do you need a observation before a hypothesis what yes I need an

(22:40) observation before hypothesis that no I didn't skip that part that's

(22:46) the part of the that's the part of the middle na polish okay go on let him let him go let him go is that to go with the

(22:51) new lesbian hairo it's very cute I love it oh again as I mentioned the consensus

(22:57) in every ACC mic field the quality of life has been improving drastically everywhere especially in Western Nations

(23:03) over time if you think the quality of life of the psychological well-being of a kid in the 1000 is better than a kid

(23:08) today you're delusional you just know nothing about the field you know nothing about research in the field so it is a

(23:14) fact that wait in the field of psychology every academic field psychology history well-being neurology

(23:20) so you know that the field of psychology has a massive uh crisis when it comes to which has nothing to do with the topic

(23:27) irrelevant oh yes there is a reproducibility fact that you reproduce any of these studies the fact that

(23:33) there's a replication crisis that's the highest in to do with the study of psychology and the history of psychology

(23:39) literally nothing to do with the fact that the well-being of children today is better than that of the when they were starving to death and had the plague yes

(23:46) so the fact that that's a result of modern technology that's not a result of the breakdown of the family unit you're

(23:52) the one who doesn't know how break down of the family unit has nothing to do with Western culture either because it's not a thing in most western cultures

(23:58) most western cultures don't have a breakdown of the family unit American issue no they don't in fact there's many

(24:05) that have far more of a family unit Australia the UK France United States

(24:10) Canada phomen health and wellness standards in every Criterion so again nothing you've said has even come close

(24:16) to addressing the point issues no I'm I'm just is what is the wellbeing of

(24:22) humans both children and adults and in every society the Western Nations who are doing all the Socialist stuff about

(24:28) healthare and uh providing people with extra money and giving people more rights they're doing better by every

(24:34) metric anybody who disagrees is just delusional and knows nothing about the data and the fact that you're bringing

(24:40) up certain cherry-picked examples doesn't change that the fact is guess

(24:45) what health care for today well-being for today for the psychological well-being of kids is better than it's

(24:51) ever been in human history and it's a fact okay are you done now sure can I reply okay we can have advanced

(24:58) technology that gives people Better Health Care Systems better Food Systems better uh you know material conditions

(25:06) and at the same time that we have those technological advances that help us with our material conditions we can also not

(25:13) have feminism which breaks down the family unit causes massive amounts of divorce or children born out of wedlock

(25:19) and causes all kinds of problems for kids growing up if you think thato

(25:24) growing up in broken homes is you know not a problem for kids then you're the one who doesn't know the I don't think

(25:30) he believes that though Rachel I agree I agree broken homes are a problem but that doesn't EV so the point here Health

(25:36) Care socialized Health Care has saved hundreds of millions of lives what does

(25:41) that have to do with feminism who paid for it the Socialist programs the

(25:47) socialist government feminist programs of the things you said women you're saying we need feminism so we can have socialism to fix all the problems that

(25:53) feminism caused that's red none of that I said see first what you do is fism and

(25:59) it causes all this social disruption and [Â __Â ] everybody but then it's good because we get the women toot socialism

(26:05) and then you fix all the problems with the socialism let's let's go back to what you this gu supposed to be smart

(26:13) there's no such thing as broken homes during uh the church like a thousand years ago there was no broken homes I

(26:18) mean broken homes has always been a thing no not to the extent that it is now not even close have you seen the

(26:24) data NE Neil Neil what do you mean did you have did you have a broken home Neil Neil heel I didn't oh okay well then you

(26:31) know you know how many kids were born out of wedlock in 1960 versus how many kids are born out of wedlock now well

(26:38) that's not the same as H as saying there wasn't broken homes before now there are broken homes do you know how rare

(26:43) divorce was prior to 40 years ago extremely R to say there hasn't been a

(26:49) massive EP epidemic increase in broken homes over the last 70 years since we've

(26:56) implemented feminism as the default is ridiculous everybody knows this I mean we can just take a look at the data I

(27:03) have a piece on my substat going over the last 45 years of national incident studies which looks at all of the data

(27:10) around you know children and women's welfare and what situations and

(27:15) conditions cause the most abuse harm uh social problems problems with well-being

(27:21) and unequivocally Far and Away they say that for children to grow up in an intact home with both biological parents

(27:27) married is by a factor of about 12 the safest way for children to grow up no it's not

(27:35) so um you kind of ignored the factors of having food and not dying of the plague those kind those kind but you can have

(27:41) that without the feminism can you not no you can't so again the reason I brought up all these socialized governments with

(27:48) all social wait wait wait wait wait wait that's literally what I'm answering that's literally what a man read so as

(27:54) you mentioned women vote for things like protectionism and government uh safety nets Health Care is one of

(28:01) these most of the Republican systems don't vote for these things they're against all of these things so all of

(28:08) the very Advanced Healthcare we see in all the Western Nations they're called socialized health care for a reason

(28:14) those are all those women things you keep voting for these safety nets and the government oversight and stuff and they work they literally work OB them if

(28:23) you had intact families and you just had the Industrial Revolution and advancement in technology

(28:30) increase in material wellbeing it wasn't a fact that we broke down the family

(28:35) unit and then built to back up with socialism that's just OB care about the family unit the family unit is

(28:40) irrelevant it doesn't even P it pales in comparison to the deaths of hunger and disease family unit I'm saying you can

(28:47) fix those things with technology and then also get rid of the feminism that causes all the social and psychological

(28:53) do you know causes it where are you getting this from what's the methodology of this is what's causing that and are

(29:00) you just or are you just looking for data to fit the narrative that you want you just start with a narrative and then is that your methodology you start with

(29:06) the narrative and then cherry-pick the data that you think fits the narrative best you mean me are you talking to me

(29:12) no I I this is like my specialty like history subject that I study that I've

(29:18) studied for years and we can see that all those material increases in well-being started as a result of the

(29:25) Industrial Revolution and an increase in technology those are the things that brought Better Health Care Systems uh

(29:31) better Food Systems less starvation it was not a result specifically and

(29:37) directly of socialist programs if anything the 20th century proves the opposite when you have communism in the

(29:42) USSR everybody starsun economy we're talking about a command economy with a whole different

(29:48) set of how they run their government we're talking about a free market over here well what's a command economy Neil when the government just controls

(29:54) everything and there's no free market okay I I don't care about Russia car about Russia let's talk about you saying

(30:01) that socialism is responsible for the increase in material well-being and I'm saying it's not it's technology so again

(30:07) then if that was the case the compan the countries with the greatest technology would have the greatest wealthcare you know what is not the case that that is

(30:15) wrong that is provably wrong you have to be just completely delus countries have the best health care yeah great Germany

(30:22) Denmark Sweden techn

(30:28) Germany Germany was at the for of medical technology they didn't get that from social you have to ask this

(30:34) question with t America is the most technologically advanced America does not have the best Healthcare the ones

(30:41) that have the best Healthcare are the ones who implemented the Socialist I'm not pro socialism I hate socialism but

(30:46) the Socialist policies who do not have the best technology they as the Republicans complain about all the time

(30:53) where's the innovation in all of their Healthcare it's all coming from America blah blah blah blah blah no the level of

(31:00) innovation is irrelevant what matters is is the moderate level of innovation that is spread across the majority higher

(31:07) levels of innovation higher levels of Technology are IR relevant compared to the moderate level of technology that is

(31:12) spread across a mass majority So when you say best your metrics are different than maybe maybe Rachels when you say

(31:18) the best health care you're taking in account the number of people can help not necessarily the quality given to

(31:24) each person is that correct well I'm I'm I'm counting the py ological well-be of all the children not just the rich white

(31:30) children okay yeah so now let me ask you this money is No Object which countries in the world have the best

(31:36) healthare money is No Object oh yeah any of them if you have money you can get any health care anywhere you want no

(31:43) money which that's not even the question he asked come on man no no so if you money

(31:48) is No Object you can fly any doctor from anywhere in the world to do anything you want

(31:54) you question his original argument was that you need feminist somehow to get this high quality Health

(32:00) the correct answer is going to be United States maybe Germany it's going to be Japan Japan's going to beat you yeah but United States

(32:08) is up there right yes if you have infinite money so your problem is your definition of best is when you factor in

(32:13) the money yes that's that's the reason the reason I'm I'm saying that the Health Care System the socialized Health

(32:19) Care system is better is because it it Inc improves the psychological state of the children of all the children not

(32:25) just the rich right children of all in the home that's true I agree I I am agree with you right so why can't we

(32:33) have this increase in technology that gives us better material conditions without the feminism that disrupts the

(32:39) social order and the family so I don't understand what is your argument that we need the feminism to get the better

(32:46) healthare outcomes no sort of so it's like the Better Health Care outcomes happen if we keep the broken families

(32:53) but add the better healthare system of socialism the healthare Health standards

(32:59) rise more wait you're advocating for broken families combined with Better Health Care like or you're just saying

(33:06) just listen listen to the words first and then keep the broken families keep the broken families say this is an

(33:11) intrinsic part of feminism you got to have broken families for feminism but it also comes with the socialized

(33:16) Healthcare so you got to take both of them because they're both the feminist package or whatever and then we have

(33:22) this is option a broken families plus socialized medicine or option b America's

(33:29) non-broken religious something or another plus American Healthcare
