(0:00) They must be selling copium on the
(0:02) discount rack right now. Charlie's
(0:04) Theren on this Call Her Daddy podcast.
(0:06) Boy, I've never seen a woman so proud to
(0:09) be a bop. Just admitting her bop lore on
(0:12) full display. I got a banger from Piers
(0:14) Morgan Uncensored. Let's get straight
(0:16) into it.
(0:17) I like want to like look at them and
(0:19) just be like, do you know how it is to
(0:22) live exactly how I want to live?
(0:25) Selfish, bro. This a grown woman with
(0:27) kids. so selfish
(0:28) to experience motherhood exactly how I
(0:31) wanted to experience it and I know the
(0:33) next thing they say is like well that's
(0:34) not fair on your kids can I tell you
(0:36) something that will be their story to
(0:38) tell I can't tell you I can
(0:41) man I'm just going to give them trauma
(0:43) and they got to deal with it man such a
(0:45) good mom right
(0:46) only tell you that this is the best way
(0:48) that I know how to be a mother to them
(0:50) maybe
(0:51) they'll grow up and tell their story and
(0:53) I will respect that
(0:55) well she also wanted audiences to know
(0:57) how liberating it is for her children
(0:59) not to have a father.
(1:01) I love that I don't have to run every
(1:03) [ __ ] thing by a guy. I don't I love
(1:06) that I don't have to Well, oh my god.
(1:08) Co- like I [ __ ] love that I don't
(1:11) have to do any of that stuff. And my
(1:14) children, you know, we joke. Listen, I
(1:16) think you can tell like this is how I
(1:17) raise my kids. Like, right, we don't
(1:19) hide this [ __ ]
(1:21) Yikes. Let's just look at some stats
(1:23) real quick. fixfamilycourts.com
(1:25) did this and um it's really alarming. Um
(1:29) and we we'll just we we'd like I'd like
(1:31) to dive into this just to show you guys
(1:33) how bad it is for single moms to do this
(1:36) on their own, right? 63% of youth
(1:38) suicides. 90% of all homeless homeless
(1:40) and runaway children. 85% of all
(1:42) children who show behavior disorders.
(1:44) 80% of our words with anger problems.
(1:46) 71% of all high school dropouts. 75 are
(1:48) adolescent patients in chemical abuse.
(1:50) 70% of juveniles and state operated
(1:52) institutions. And 85% of all youth
(1:53) sitting in prisons grow up in fatherless
(1:54) homes.
(1:57) You're doing such a great job, Chariss.
(2:00) You're doing such just keep it up, girl.
(2:02) Keep it up. You know what? You know what
(2:05) dictates a woman's worth as a wife and a
(2:07) mother? The man that she can keep being
(2:10) a single mom. No badge of honor in that.
(2:12) No badge of honor in that. I'm sorry,
(2:14) Chariss. There's just no badge of honor.
(2:16) So, don't be proud of that. Be ashamed.
(2:18) This in perspective. I've probably had
(2:20) three one night stands in my entire
(2:22) life.
(2:22) Okay.
(2:23) Whoa.
(2:25) Imagine your mom on a podcast admitting
(2:26) that. You got to love it.
(2:28) But I did just recently [ __ ] a
(2:30) 26-year-old and it was really [ __ ]
(2:32) amazing. [ __ ] yes.
(2:34) Yes. And I've never done that. And I was
(2:36) like,
(2:36) and see these women being like, "Yes,
(2:38) queen."
(2:42) The echo chamber of delusion. Lord have
(2:45) mercy.
(2:46) Oh, this is great. Okay, let me just say
(2:48) that 26-year-old is the luckiest [ __ ]
(2:50) man walking on this goddamn planet. He's
(2:53) walking different today knowing Oh my
(2:56) god.
(2:56) He for sure is not, but thank you.
(2:58) No, he is.
(3:00) What a story to tell your homies. Uh
(3:02) yeah, man. So I just bucked Charlie
(3:03) Theren. No, no way, dude. I mean, I got
(3:06) her way past your prime, dude. But I
(3:08) still got in her cuts like a surgeon,
(3:09) bro.
(3:10) Has been viewed by nearly a million
(3:12) people so far. Reactions been divided
(3:13) between those who celebrate Charlies as
(3:15) quote a powerful badass, epitome of a
(3:18) strong woman fighting against the evil
(3:21) patriarchy and others who in equally
(3:23) striden language view the whole episode
(3:24) as yet another example of modern
(3:26) feminist media denigrating the role of
(3:28) men at every given opportunity. All of
(3:30) makes it a all of which makes it a good
(3:32) starting point for a lively debate.
(3:34) Well, joining me for this battle of the
(3:36) sexes, host of the Crucible podcast,
(3:38) Andrew Wilson, who I could imagine was
(3:40) visibly shuddering as he listened to
(3:42) those clips, uh, Jediah Ber, who's the
(3:45) host of the Jedi Ber show, commentator
(3:48) and author of the case for cancel
(3:50) culture, Ernest Owens, and the editor of
(3:51) the user mag newsletter, Taylor Loren.
(3:54) Well, welcome to all of you and Jedial,
(3:56) welcome to you, especially because
(3:57) you're making your uncensored debut. We
(3:59) always like debutons. I'm always Thank
(4:02) you very much, Pierce. Hey, Pierce, man.
(4:03) Have me on, brother. Come on now. Get
(4:05) Get the Get the Levy Nicks on there.
(4:07) Always astonished when people come back
(4:09) for more. But thank God they do. And
(4:11) thank God Andrew Wilson does. Andrew,
(4:13) your thoughts on Charlie Thron. She
(4:15) doesn't need a man. She likes banging 26
(4:18) year olds when she feels like it. You
(4:20) don't need fathers in life. You just
(4:22) need a strong badass woman.
(4:24) Well, you know, it's really funny. Um,
(4:26) the reason nobody cares really very much
(4:29) when uh a 40-year-old attractive woman
(4:32) has sex with some random young man is
(4:34) because it's not impressive. It's
(4:35) impressive when men can bang young women
(4:39) because most men can't bang young women,
(4:41) but most older women can bang young men.
(4:44) So, it's just not an impressive
(4:45) accomplishment. Of course, these are the
(4:47) same women who will screech because uh
(4:49) you know, Leonardo DiCaprio decides that
(4:51) he wants to change up uh you know, at 25
(4:55) years old, any of the uh broads he has
(4:57) hanging around. But this is not an
(4:59) impressive accomplishment. All a woman
(5:01) needs to do to get laid is go somewhere
(5:03) where there's men and offer it up. It's
(5:06) not the case for men. So, it's an
(5:08) unimpressive accomplishment on its face.
(5:10) Uh as to the rest of what she's saying,
(5:11) this is just normal tripe, right? Her
(5:13) kids are the ones who are going to get
(5:14) punished. uh they're always the ones who
(5:17) get punished. We can look at the data
(5:18) for outcomes on children who are raised
(5:20) in single mother homes. It's not good.
(5:23) It's not good for their mental health.
(5:24) It's not. And by the way, the rates of
(5:26) abuse from having strange men around
(5:28) skyrocket. Terrible idea. And it's
(5:30) exactly the wrong kind of propaganda to
(5:32) be pushing.
(5:33) All right, Taylor Loren. Um, isn't it
(5:35) just a factual reality of life that
(5:38) women are predominantly happier with a
(5:41) man by their side and children are
(5:43) predominantly better off in life with a
(5:46) present father?
(5:48) Um, I think listen, children are better
(5:50) off in life when they have a loving
(5:52) household and not all of those
(5:54) households have fathers. I mean, there
(5:56) are
(5:57) Oh my god,
(5:58) you stupid
(5:59) lesbian parents. There are uh, you know,
(6:01) different types of arrangements. Um, I
(6:03) think it's important for kids to have
(6:07) Andrew Space
(6:08) different figures in their life who they
(6:10) can look up to. Um, and you know, I
(6:12) think it's really important to expose
(6:13) kids to all different types of figures,
(6:15) but that doesn't have to be, you know,
(6:17) that doesn't have to be like a man.
(6:19) Let's expose our kids to levels of
(6:21) degeneracy that they should not know at
(6:22) their age. Let's take them to nudist
(6:24) beaches. Let's take them to, you know,
(6:26) brothel in Germany where they can see
(6:28) these AI robot dolls. Let's expose them
(6:30) to everything. like that logic is so
(6:32) flawed.
(6:33) Man that's standing around all the time.
(6:35) There's plenty of terrible fathers out
(6:36) there, too. So, um yeah, I think it's
(6:38) great that that the child is growing up
(6:40) in a loving household and uh hopefully,
(6:42) you know, she'll expose the child to
(6:44) lots of different types of things.
(6:45) Yeah. But can you acknowledge that we
(6:46) have now been studying this phenomenon
(6:48) of single motherhood for years and years
(6:50) and years and that the outcomes for
(6:52) children of single mothers tend to be
(6:53) terrible in comparison to the outcomes
(6:55) of children without them. Can you just
(6:57) acknowledge that that is true? So I
(7:00) think what you're talking about are
(7:01) studies.
(7:02) I'm asking a question. Don't run from
(7:03) the question. Yes or no? Can you I want
(7:06) you to acknowledge with a yes or no.
(7:07) Then a qualifier. Yes or no. Isn't it
(7:10) true that outcomes for children
(7:13) when they're raised by single mothers
(7:14) tend to be worse than those with a
(7:16) mother and a father in the house? Yes or
(7:17) no? Then give me your answer.
(7:19) So I'd love to respond if you stop
(7:21) talking over me. Um anyway, most most
(7:25) single mothers are not charis millions
(7:27) and millions and millions of dollars. So
(7:29) when you look at studies um like that, a
(7:31) lot of it has to do with the economic
(7:32) opportunities that a lot of single
(7:34) mothers have. Um you know, women make
(7:36) less than men as a whole. They're
(7:38) subject to more sexism and
(7:40) false pay gap. No. If that was the case,
(7:43) every company would just hire women.
(7:45) Discrimination. So it can often be more
(7:48) challenging for them to raise.
(7:50) So the answer is yes.
(7:52) No. The answer is is Charlie.
(7:54) It sounds like you just said that the
(7:55) answer is yes. The answer according to
(7:58) you just now is yes.
(8:01) No. Any
(8:02) and then you just make excuses for it.
(8:03) You're like, "Yes, this is women right
(8:06) now. This is so weird." What? I You're
(8:08) like shouting at it.
(8:09) Yeah. You've never had somebody push
(8:11) back on your stupid beliefs. I know.
(8:12) Crazy concept, right? She didn't realize
(8:14) she was playing with fire with Andrew.
(8:16) Bro, you going to talk some nonsense out
(8:18) the side of your neck. You better be
(8:19) ready.
(8:20) Well, do you know what it is?
(8:21) Okay, let's bring Hang on. Time out.
(8:23) Time out. Let's bring in Jediah. Taylor,
(8:26) this is not rocket science. First of
(8:27) all, you lost me a cis male. You You
(8:29) just need a guy. Just a man, right? We
(8:31) don't need all these terms, these
(8:32) nonsensical, ridiculous terms that, you
(8:34) know, modern leftists have come up with.
(8:36) It's just a man. Children do better when
(8:38) there is a mom and there is a dad. And
(8:41) the reason is that men and women are
(8:43) completely different. They bring very
(8:44) different things to the table. And
(8:46) children need the role model of a mom
(8:49) and a dad. Not just people around. Sure,
(8:51) you can have aunts, you can have uncles,
(8:53) you can have friends, but we're talking
(8:54) about the two individuals that are
(8:56) raising the children.
(8:57) I don't think lesbians cuz they're both
(8:58) feminine, right? You need to have a man
(9:00) with testosterone and a woman with
(9:02) estrogen. Chat, put one in the chat if
(9:04) you agree that you need a man and a
(9:07) woman. We're better together and
(9:08) together we're better. We're both We're
(9:09) both different but equal at the same
(9:11) time. We bring different things to the
(9:12) table. Men are more logical. Women are
(9:14) more emotional. Women are more
(9:15) nurturing. Men are are stronger. Like,
(9:18) that's just part of it. You need both.
(9:20) It's a great combination. It's like
(9:22) peanut butter and jelly. It's a really
(9:24) good combo. You know what I mean? It's a
(9:25) really good combo. It's like pepperonis
(9:27) on pizza. Great combo. Some of you guys
(9:29) might not like this. H like I'm I'm a
(9:30) cheese guy myself. It's a good combo.
(9:32) And even in lesbian relationships,
(9:34) there's always a masculine facing woman
(9:36) and then a feminine facing woman as
(9:38) well. So, even in lesbian relationships,
(9:40) in chat, put them one in the chat if you
(9:41) agree. Even in lesbian relationships,
(9:43) they're still adhering to traditional
(9:45) gender roles. One of them looks more
(9:46) masculine and one of them looks more
(9:48) more feminine. So deep in your bones,
(9:50) you realize that you guys still need to
(9:52) kind of look different. You don't a lot
(9:54) of times you don't see two feminine
(9:56) women, feminine women in a lesbian
(9:58) relationship. It's just not the case,
(9:59) dude. It's not the case.
(10:01) And let me just ask you this question.
(10:03) Wait, I'm not done yet. You you you
(10:04) complained that Andrew interrupted you
(10:06) and now you just interrupted me. I'm not
(10:08) done yet. Chariss, you're right. She is
(10:11) rich. She has a ton of money. But what
(10:13) example do you think she's sending to
(10:15) young women everywhere that this is
(10:16) somehow empowering? That you should
(10:18) strive, by the way, you should strive to
(10:21) be the single mom because you don't have
(10:23) to deal with a guy. You don't have to
(10:25) answer to a man. Oh, isn't that so
(10:27) wonderful? And guess who will pay the
(10:28) price? My kid, she even says, "My kids
(10:30) can tell their story." How unbelievably
(10:33) selfish of her to say,
(10:35) facts. Hey, I preached to Jebaniah. I
(10:39) think that's her name. My children will
(10:40) one day to get to tell a story that they
(10:43) had no father because I decided that I
(10:45) just wanted to do this myself. Me,
(10:47) myself, and my money. Is that the
(10:49) message?
(10:49) I wanted to go home 26.
(10:52) They shouldn't be able to raise
(10:53) children. You need a You need a man.
(10:55) What about women?
(10:56) We're not talking about Taylor. No one
(10:58) said, "What should I'm not talking
(11:00) about?"
(11:00) Well, I'll tell you what I tell you.
(11:02) Yeah. And this this is a typical case of
(11:04) moving the G Coast. Well, what about
(11:05) Lesbos? We're not talking about Lesbos.
(11:07) Ain't that right, Loki?
(11:11) I've fallen at work and been injured.
(11:13) Oh, wait. I should call my lawyer.
(11:17) I'm John Morgan of Morgan and Morgan.
(11:19) Hey, John Morgan of Morgan and Morgan.
(11:20) It's Levi Nicks of YouTube. Can I get
(11:22) some cash, please?
(11:24) Morgan and Morgan andgan.
(11:28) Did you know that your injury could be
(11:29) worth millions of dollars? Morgan and
(11:31) Morgan is the largest injury law firm in
(11:33) America, and they've recovered over $20
(11:34) billion for their clients. $20 billion?
(11:38) That's a lot of cash. The insurance
(11:40) companies tried to lowball me, but
(11:42) Morgan and Morgan was able to take my
(11:43) pain and suffering and turn it into cold
(11:45) hard cash. It's almost a good thing I
(11:48) was injured. But wait, wait, wait, wait,
(11:49) wait. How much is Morgan and Morgan
(11:50) going to cost me? You never owe them
(11:52) legal fees unless they're successful.
(11:54) So, it's completely free unless you win.
(11:56) Yeah, hiring a lawyer, that sounds like
(11:58) really difficult. It's actually super
(12:00) easy. You can just go to their website
(12:01) and in a couple clicks, you can find out
(12:03) if you have a case. And you can
(12:04) literally do it from your smartphone.
(12:06) And remember, there was only one. Morgan
(12:08) and Morgan. Wait, wait, but it but it's
(12:10) two names, though. How is it? Give me
(12:12) the script.
(12:14) Oh, both are last names. Okay, I get it.
(12:17) I get it. Okay, roll it. You can start
(12:18) your claim today by going to
(12:19) forthepeople.com/levi
(12:22) found in the description below. So, if
(12:23) you're injured, you can trust Morgan and
(12:25) Morgan.
(12:29) There's my boy. A
(12:32) It's my little Bobby. My little Bobby
(12:35) boy. Yeah. Goodbye.
(12:42) He's such a good boy. Such a good boy.
(12:46) Let's get back into this nonsense
(12:48) brother.
(12:49) Strange. What I find strange is I know
(12:51) Charlie's a bit when she was dating
(12:53) Shaun Penn and thought she was very
(12:56) nice, but she was always very elegant.
(12:58) If you interviewed her, her whole thing
(13:00) was high-end, elegant, you know, all the
(13:02) highest end advertising and so on. And
(13:05) then you see her there in this podcast
(13:07) and she's like effing and blinding
(13:09) talking about banging 26 year olds. Very
(13:11) very different Ernest to the Charlie
(13:13) Thrawn I thought I knew. Uh I'm not
(13:16) saying it's good, bad or whatever. But I
(13:19) do wonder if it was a male movie star
(13:22) sitting on a sofa brazenly boasting
(13:25) about banging 26 year olds. How old is
(13:28) Charlene? Charlies 50. If a 50-year-old
(13:32) male star was talking, boasting about
(13:35) banging 26 year old girls, right, and he
(13:38) was boasting about not needing a woman
(13:40) in his life, not needing a mother, all
(13:43) these kind of things, but in reverse, I
(13:45) don't think you'd be approving of this,
(13:47) Ernest.
(13:49) Tax day has passed. But for
(13:50) He's got He's got a point there. He's
(13:52) got a point. If it was if it was Leo up
(13:53) there talking about all this stuff, they
(13:56) would not be having it, brother. They
(13:57) would not be having it. actual shock and
(14:00) and awe over Charliss. They're wrong
(14:02) because a lot of women actually her age
(14:04) don't feel the liberty to do that on um
(14:06) a public facing platform
(14:07) because they're not her. They're not
(14:10) millionaires. They're not like Charlie's
(14:11) there and she still looks pretty good.
(14:13) Like a lot of 50-year-olds look 50
(14:15) and so that's why we're talking about
(14:16) her. We don't talk about men who do it
(14:18) often on here because it's so norm. I
(14:21) mean if you look at who's in politics
(14:22) currently right now, they were doing it
(14:24) their entire career before they got to
(14:26) the White House. So, it's not that much
(14:28) of a shock. You know, there's a guy who
(14:30) got elected president
(14:31) and you screamed bloody murder about it
(14:33) and got elected. And so,
(14:34) and you screamed bloody murder about it.
(14:36) What are you talking about?
(14:39) You liberals said that that was the most
(14:41) horrible thing. He was a terrible role
(14:43) model. How could he? And here's Charliss
(14:45) there is saying saying this and you're
(14:47) like, "Ah, she's your power boss babe.
(14:49) Andrew, come on."
(14:50) You're see if I talk to him to tell me
(14:53) to be quiet and
(14:54) you were done talking, dude. We're done
(14:56) talking. Come on.
(14:57) I wasn't done talking actually. Can I
(14:59) Can I actually You can You kind noticed
(15:01) you.
(15:01) Okay. Thanks. So, um, what I was getting
(15:04) at is that there is a double standard.
(15:06) Um, and I I think honestly, like I said
(15:07) before, I don't know what liberal he
(15:09) talked about, but I was not a liberal
(15:10) that said that Trump talking about
(15:12) Grabber about a [ __ ] was the worst
(15:14) thing he ever said because there's a lot
(15:15) of other things he have said that I
(15:17) believe is far worse and actually should
(15:18) cause more attention. I'm sorry, but
(15:20) just this guy's presence and having
(15:23) medals behind him and like these little
(15:25) plaques, it looks it's like a glorified
(15:28) high schooler.
(15:30) Look at all my awards, bro. Nobody care
(15:32) unless you got a Grammy or an Oscar.
(15:34) Nobody cares, bro. Actually, look at me.
(15:36) I'm over here with the with the
(15:38) subscriber play button.
(15:44) Oh my god,
(15:46) stupid.
(15:46) Look at me. Nobody cares about your got
(15:48) got the play button right there. Oh my
(15:50) god. But but I feel like this is
(15:51) different. Like people get this one.
(15:53) Like all these ones that he's sitting
(15:54) behind, I feel like nobody gets. But I
(15:56) don't know. Maybe I'm just making
(15:57) excuses, chat. What do y'all think? Am I
(15:59) Am I way off base here?
(16:00) That being said, I I just feel like the
(16:02) only reason why we're talking about it
(16:03) is because women like Charl often don't
(16:06) um do this on a normal. So it feels
(16:09) abnormal and that's why we're discussing
(16:10) it.
(16:11) Okay. Andrew, why do these libs these
(16:14) libs talk out of both sides of their
(16:15) mouth? I mean, look at it. She refused
(16:17) to acknowledge the outcomes for single
(16:19) moms, pivots immediately. Hang on.
(16:21) Immediately. Hang on. Hang on.
(16:23) Immediately. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
(16:26) Look, I'm sorry. If you have progressive
(16:28) talking points, if it walks like a duck
(16:29) and it quacks like a duck, a duck, I
(16:31) call call it a duck. So, the thing is,
(16:33) right, the libs the libs on the panel
(16:35) very clearly, right? She evades the the
(16:37) answer, refuses to give us the answer of
(16:39) if outcomes for single uh for children
(16:41) of single moms are worse. Refuses, gives
(16:44) us a bunch of qualifiers proving that
(16:45) they are. Still refuses to do it. He
(16:47) says, "Well, this is so common place for
(16:49) men. Look at the sexual deviant that we
(16:51) have in the White House and says, "But
(16:53) I'm not throwing a fit about that. I'm
(16:55) not throwing a fit about that though."
(16:56) Yeah, they did throw a fit about it.
(16:59) Discussion is just over everyone like
(17:01) he's very
(17:02) It's an ineffective discussion. I would
(17:04) like you, you know,
(17:05) there there it is. the shame, the
(17:06) insult, the guilt, the need to be right.
(17:07) He's emotional.
(17:08) Just like you to actually answer the
(17:10) questions I ask you. Why can't you
(17:12) people
(17:13) said I I have a question for Ernest?
(17:14) The shame more, I guess. Go ahead.
(17:16) Ernest, you said there was
(17:18) Hold on a second, guys. Ernest, you said
(17:20) there was a double standard. What What
(17:22) are you in your view? Where is the
(17:24) double standard? I I I because I see a
(17:25) double standard here, but I think we see
(17:27) a different double standard.
(17:29) Cool. So, what I was saying was the
(17:30) double standard reaction, right? There
(17:32) is a lot of reaction because of what
(17:33) Charlie Steron said. I'm saying that I
(17:36) understand where that that is coming
(17:37) from because we don't often see women
(17:39) like Charlies Stron on these platforms
(17:42) talking about their sexuality in this
(17:44) celebrated Ernest that's not true but
(17:46) every here's the difference. Every time
(17:48) a man every time Hold on a second. Every
(17:51) time a man says a guy can't even say
(17:53) that he prefers younger women. He can't
(17:56) even say, "Well, you know what? I prefer
(17:58) younger women because of their fertility
(17:59) is better, because they're in their peak
(18:01) attractiveness, because I want to have a
(18:02) bunch of kids and it gives me more
(18:04) time." Without getting completely trash,
(18:07) let's be clear. Let's be clear. Hang on.
(18:09) Hang on. Let's be clear. If Brad Pitt
(18:10) came out with an interview tomorrow on
(18:12) Uncensored, and I hope he does. If
(18:14) you're watching Brad, uh, my show is
(18:16) always available to you. But if he was,
(18:18) and he said, "Do you know what? Just
(18:20) only last week, I had the most
(18:22) unbelievable sex with a hot 26 year
(18:25) old." Right. You think the reaction,
(18:27) Ernest, would have been widespread
(18:29) applause for this guy. Or would it have
(18:32) been, "You dirty old man?" No, no, no.
(18:35) I'm not saying that I feel that about
(18:37) Charlie Thron. I'm just saying that's
(18:39) the double standard, right? Leo DiCaprio
(18:42) gets mocked at every award show because
(18:44) he dates women half his age.
(18:47) Now, now he's charis everyone's like,
(18:49) "Oh, this is amazing."
(18:52) A man would have been called a group
(18:54) example. I can give you an example where
(18:55) that backfired. So, so let me be very
(18:57) clear. So, let me let me give you a good
(18:59) example of this actually.
(19:00) Even if it is a great example, a
(19:02) stunning example, the exception never
(19:04) makes the rule.
(19:06) Um, first of all, it's if it's a
(19:08) pattern, right? Charisse is not doing
(19:10) this on the regular. That's why this is
(19:11) a big news story. She's been mostly in
(19:14) long-term relationship. She does not
(19:15) have a habit of doing this. Leonardo
(19:17) Leonardo DiCaprio's entire romantic, a
(19:19) lot of his romantic history has been
(19:21) this pattern which has become a running
(19:23) joke. The first couple years he did it,
(19:24) no one cared. But it's been decades like
(19:27) over like that's not why it's that's not
(19:29) why it's a news story. With respect,
(19:31) first of all, first of all, both of
(19:33) those things have been covered in the
(19:34) news. But the reason what Pierce is
(19:36) getting at, I think I don't want to put
(19:38) words in his mouth. This is being
(19:39) celebrated. Do you understand the
(19:41) difference? Fe modern feminism has made
(19:43) it so that we now celebrate that Chariss
(19:46) Thein. And by the way, I don't give a
(19:47) lick. Honestly, it's consensual. I don't
(19:49) care if she sleeps with a 26-year-old.
(19:51) By the way, there are a lot of 26y old
(19:53) men who will be absolutely thrilled that
(19:56) she's on the
(19:57) way. If I was 26 and she was knocking on
(19:59) my door, I probably would have done it
(20:00) just for the lore.
(20:02) That's correct.
(20:02) Like, do it for the story line, bro.
(20:04) I mean, I don't care either. We can
(20:06) agree there. But I I'm smart enough to
(20:08) acknowledge that she is being celebrated
(20:10) for that action. Whereas a Leonardo
(20:12) DiCaprio or the average guy for that
(20:14) matter just saying, "Hey, I prefer a
(20:15) 22-year-old to a 32-year-old will get
(20:18) destroyed in every possible I I actually
(20:21) have no problem with what she said about
(20:22) a 26-y old. That's entirely down to her.
(20:24) She's a single woman. She can have sex
(20:26) with whoever she likes if it's consent
(20:27) to an adult. I do I do though have a
(20:30) problem with and Andrew was I think
(20:32) right about this. In a way, what she's
(20:34) saying is all your quaint ideas about
(20:37) you need a bloke around, you need a
(20:39) father, you need a husband. That's all
(20:41) [ __ ] Look at me. I'm proof. It's
(20:43) all great. I don't believe women when
(20:45) they say that. I don't believe men when
(20:47) they say the same thing. You know, I
(20:49) just think that actually the ideal is
(20:51) that you have a man and woman around
(20:53) kids and they bring them up together and
(20:55) and if that isn't possible and it
(20:57) doesn't work out, okay, you make it
(20:59) work, but to actually try and pretend
(21:01) this is actually utopia uh and this is
(21:04) the best possible thing for your kids. I
(21:07) don't think that's true. And I say that
(21:09) as a divorce.
(21:09) I agree with Pierce on that. The problem
(21:12) with modern day feminism is that they
(21:14) promote single motherhood. They're
(21:16) promoting that it's cool to be alone.
(21:18) It's hip to be alone. You can get
(21:19) government assistance assistance to be
(21:21) alone. You can get section 8, food
(21:23) stamps, EBT. You can get help from the
(21:26) government being alone. And they're so
(21:28) like single women are so celebrated.
(21:30) Like I'm I'm single and independent. I'm
(21:32) I'm a strong independent woman. I don't
(21:33) need a man. There's no male equivalent
(21:36) for that.
(21:39) What am I a strong independent man? I
(21:41) don't need a woman. Like bro, no. No.
(21:44) No. No man says that. And we and we
(21:46) celebrate women for doing the basic
(21:48) things that we think every man should
(21:50) have to do. Like a woman who achieves
(21:52) the bare minimum of a man is celebrated
(21:55) as a woman. Oh, great job, queen. You
(21:58) have a job and you pay your own bills.
(22:01) Great job. Whereas a guy, he can have a
(22:04) job and pay his own bills and women will
(22:05) still call him a bum because he doesn't
(22:07) make six figures. He doesn't have a nice
(22:09) car. He doesn't have his own house. He
(22:10) doesn't have assets. He rents an
(22:11) apartment. Like just just think about
(22:14) this. A man has his own car. He drives a
(22:16) Honda Civic. He has his own apartment.
(22:17) He has a okay job, right? He's making
(22:19) 80k a year. Most women would be like,
(22:21) "He needs to make more money." On the
(22:23) flip side, a woman, she drives the same
(22:24) car, has the same apartment, works the
(22:26) same job. They're like, "Yes, queen.
(22:28) Yes, get your own money yet." Like,
(22:30) what? That's what's so crazy to me.
(22:33) That's why I think a lot of men are just
(22:34) checking out. They're done with it.
(22:36) They're over it. They're done being
(22:38) shamed for being exceptional men when
(22:40) women think that they can do the same
(22:42) things and just get it's shouted from
(22:43) the rooftops. Oh my god, you're so
(22:44) great. When men are actually being
(22:46) exceptional. They're they're paying
(22:48) their own bills. They're doing
(22:49) everything that you strong independent
(22:50) women want to do that we celebrate.
(22:52) Let's start celebrating men that are
(22:53) doing this stuff, too.
(22:55) Having their own job, having their own
(22:57) place, having their own car. Let's start
(22:58) celebrating that. If you ladies started
(23:00) doing it, I bet more men want to come
(23:02) over and start dating y'all. Ain't that
(23:03) right, Lok?
(23:04) But I hope you guys enjoyed today's
(23:06) episode. Don't forget to like, comment,
(23:07) subscribe. It was good to have you guys
(23:08) out, man. Until next time. Peace.
(23:14) It's the Levi next show.
