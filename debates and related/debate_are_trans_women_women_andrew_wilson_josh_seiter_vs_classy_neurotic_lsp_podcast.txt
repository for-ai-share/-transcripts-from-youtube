(0:15) [Music]
(0:24) in the street there's nothing to eat
(0:30) we're on our winning streak going out in
(0:35) [Music]
(0:49) [Applause]
(0:54) sty I hear you I'm Not Dead Yet get out of here
(1:02) [Music]
(1:07) hey everybody today we're debating whether or not trans women or women and we are starting right now with Classy
(1:13) neurotics opening statement thanks for being with us classy the floor is all
(1:19) yours all right if you can see my screen here my name is classy and I am going to be arguing that trans women are
(1:28) women so let's get some definitions out of the way I just want to make sure your name is your name is class classy classy
(1:34) yes okay yeah uh definitions transgender is an umbrella term for persons whose
(1:40) gender identity gender expression Behavior does not conform to that is typically associated with the sex to
(1:46) which they were assigned at Birth gender identity is the internal sense of gender gender Expressions how a person shows
(1:52) their gender identity to others to behavior clothing hairstyles Voice or body characteristics sex is biological
(1:59) stat as male or female and can be attributed to chromones hormones or the external or
(2:04) inter and internal anatomy gender are the socially constructed roles behaviors
(2:10) activities and attributes that the society considers appropriate for men women Etc and then interex atypical uh
(2:15) sexual development so I want to make this point clear definitions are very important especially when we want to get
(2:21) to the technical knowhow but I want to make the point that the way we use language often times the concept of the
(2:27) word is more important than the actual ual dictionary definitions audience can
(2:33) you tell me what is the definition of a camera here I'll give it to you it's fine you don't have to know the
(2:39) definition of a camera okay this is the definition of a camera but you understand the concept of what a camera is because you know the function of a
(2:45) camera and we're going to find this is the same situation with women trans women so this is a camera this is a
(2:53) camera this is also a camera cameras coming in all different shapes and sizes and all different types of Technologies
(2:58) but you know what a camera is you can ask a drod what is a camera they won't give you a dictionary definition but
(3:03) they'll give you a a a definition that fits the function of a camera so what is
(3:09) a woman if you look at the dictionary definition it's going to say something like adult human female and that is not
(3:14) wrong however what we're going to find that in society ultimately what a woman is is the social expectations and social
(3:21) norms of what we expect adult uh human females to do and what we find is is
(3:27) that transgender women are women because because they can fulfill the role uh expectations and Norm of what is
(3:34) expected of an adult human female they may not do it 100% of the time but
(3:40) neither do cisgendered women this is a woman this is a woman this is also a
(3:45) woman just by looking at them you already know what a woman is and they fulfill the uh function regardless of
(3:52) whatever their biological uh basis is so to quote Natalie win it is not I
(3:58) who misunderstands biology it is you who misunderstands language expect Andrew Wilson to use all
(4:05) sorts of inflammatory languages and phrases like oh it's just a bunch of gay dudes who like to dress up like women
(4:11) because it gets them off and they usually suffer from Idol gyil this is a hypothesis uh popularized by the
(4:18) researcher known as Ray Blanchard however this has been uh refuted multiple times once a researcher known
(4:25) as Charles Moser used ran uh banters method uh uh to cisgender women because
(4:32) uh to my knowledge he Blan never uses with of cisgender women only with of transgender women and we actually found
(4:38) out that 93% of C women have Idol gyia using blanter method and then a German
(4:44) group also try to use the same method to prove a blanch is right but they couldn't find any conclusive
(4:50) evidence as Josh Cedar to say something like male pattern violence uh don't say just because you're trans and these men
(4:56) are now being put in prisons with women who have committed nonviolent offense and uh sexual acts I can't I can't say
(5:02) the full quote but essentially what he's trying to say is that the male pattern of B do doesn't change just because
(5:09) you're transgender but we what we find do the research is that the opposite is true in fact that transgender women are
(5:15) more likely to be the victims of violence and the perpetrators and you might ask why should we care about transgender women
(5:21) well you see like many groups in the United States transgender women are in fact discriminate against in things such
(5:28) as housing employment and education and these things often are going to have uh huge implications for their
(5:35) health what does the Sciences the science says that gender affirming care works and that the D transition rate is
(5:41) very low less than 1% and that fact that more people uh regret having back surgery than uh than you know their
(5:49) gender affirming care so in conclusion transgender women are women because they
(5:54) can fulfill the social role of what is expected of an adult human female even
(5:59) even if it's not 100% of the time but these are do isgender women and you should look at what the research says
(6:05) what the science says and not listen to failed reality TV stars like Josh Cedar thank
(6:13) you yours uh thank you uh The Prompt I'm here to claim in the affirmative is
(6:19) trans women are women this claim is not something I can prove to you affirmatively it's a semantic claim that
(6:25) really comes down to how one defines women I cannot teach you anything about the world if you're convinced you have
(6:31) all the answers when it comes to transmed care I can state that there is a general consensus on treatment while
(6:37) also acknowledging that much of the studies are low quality and that the transitioners exist if you come into
(6:42) this debate with the position that trans women are not women because a person cannot change their sex or gender I
(6:48) probably cannot debate you out of your predisposition instead I'll frame this argument in a more humanely authentic
(6:54) way that rids itself of the semantic baggage this debate is about freedom
(6:59) versus control this debate is about privacy versus Invasion trans people
(7:06) exist and their existence is a difficult one trans people are a small but significant part of our society they
(7:12) face disproportionately High rates of suicide abuse homelessness and discrimination these challenges are not
(7:18) inherence in being transgendered but are a consequence of a societal rejection and a lack of support evidence shows
(7:24) that trans affirming care reduces these harms particularly in trans youth despite this there is a concerted and
(7:31) organized effort to deny trans people access to this type of healthare numerous medical organizations such as
(7:37) the American Academy of Pediatrics support gender affirming care as evidence-based and life saving trans
(7:42) affirming care has shown to reduce suicidality by significant margins in trans youth denial of such care does not
(7:49) make trans people go away it just exacerbates their troubles and it leads to worse outcomes for all of us this
(7:55) debate is also about parental rights I have a right as a a parent to see that
(8:00) my child gets the health care they need to live a a full life it is not the
(8:05) place of other people to tell my child uh or to determine on my mine and my child's behalf what their health care is
(8:12) how my trans child is treated is between my child their doctor and myself now you
(8:17) might disagree that trans people exist you might disagree with trans affirming Medical Care you might have valid
(8:23) concerns about a whole Litany of problems as it relates to trans people and that's totally fine the issue is
(8:30) when you intrude into my family to tell me how to raise my kid one side of this
(8:36) debate is about Freedom uh the freedom to pursue the healthcare needs of your child the freedom to live a life of
(8:42) dignity and respect without surrendering to surrendering to genital inspections to enter a bathroom the freedom to act
(8:49) and be the person you want to be without the government standing in the way and the other side of this debate is about
(8:56) control controlling how masculine or feminine boys and girls are by legal mandate controlling what kinds of books
(9:02) about gay or trans people my child can read in school your kid doesn't have to check out the book controlling which
(9:08) bathroom they can use this debate has been poisoned by fearmongering people who themselves do not have trans
(9:15) children are trans women women that depends entirely on how you define women
(9:21) if you're definitionally locked onto some definition which excludes trans people then the answer is no if you're open to acknowledging that we live in an
(9:28) everchanging world and our definitions for Words change all the time as we get new information to continue to develop
(9:33) then yes trans women are women if you say that a woman is defined by her
(9:38) biology I ask you what about her biology if you say she's defined by the presence
(9:44) of XX chromosomes then I will point to medical conditions such as Turner syndrome in which you would people you
(9:49) would recognize as a woman are born without the requisite chromosome if you say a woman is defined by the presence
(9:56) of a a vagina I point to people who you would recognize is women who are born with vaginal agenesis in which a vagina
(10:03) does not develop there are women with Swire syndrome who have female reproductive organs but XY chromosomes
(10:10) there are women who develop without ovary there are women who develop without a uterus there are women who
(10:15) developed without a vagina there are women with XY chromosomes there's women with single X chromosomes if these
(10:20) people are not women then I ask you what they are and why all of these variations
(10:26) in human development tell us that sex is varied and diverse and that it's not a simple 50-50 split gender is a spectrum
(10:33) if you definitionally lock women out based on which body parts they have or they do not have you're making a
(10:39) political decision in order to exclude people from a category based on nothing more than Prejudice and that therein is
(10:46) the Crux of our political issue this is at heart a semantic debate which judges a more substantive issue how do we live
(10:52) with trans people suppose you feel trans women aren't women you are entitled to
(10:58) your opinion what you are not entitled to is intruding into my household and telling my family what they can and
(11:03) cannot do with their body because you are obsessed with them having the right set of genitals as I said at the top of
(11:09) this I cannot convince you if you are not open to being convinced instead I ask you to imagine your child comes to
(11:16) you one day and tells you that they are trans you really want the government telling you on your behalf how to
(11:22) navigate that problem all right thank you that's my opening thank you very much for that opening one moment I'm
(11:29) just going to rearrange the old videos on screen as you can notice folks that scrambled just for a moment but want to
(11:34) say if it's your first time here at modern day debate want to say welcome we are striving to provide a neutral debate
(11:41) platform so that everybody has their chance to make their case on a Level Playing Field don't forget to hit that
(11:47) subscribe Button as we have many more debates coming up and with that we are going to kick it over to Josh AKA Nicole
(11:54) thanks for being with us the floor is all yours thank you well class scerotic misgendered me a number of times um I
(12:02) identify as a woman I go by J and classy nurotic referred to me as he him
(12:08) multiple times and I just want to you know make sure we're all clear that we're not going to be transphobic or
(12:14) bigoted during this conversation we're all going to remain respectful so I just simply demand that everybody call me she
(12:20) her this entire time and refer to me as Jay um and that's all I'm going to ask I
(12:26) think it's a very small request um I just want to make it clear as a self-identified transwoman myself that's
(12:33) following the guidelines to a te no pun intended we're all just men in costume
(12:39) dressing up that are mentally ill and we think that we're women but we're not um
(12:45) just like the anorexic man at 80 pounds thinks he's fat he's not really fat and giving him lipos suction and giving him
(12:53) diet pills isn't helping him you're actually harming him by giving him that
(12:58) of affirming care that affirms his delusions um we're all just cosplaying
(13:05) and Ling as women 4 to 13% of us never get bottom surgery which means 87 to 95%
(13:12) of us are walking around with penises and balls between our legs most of us are all going to have to get prostate
(13:19) exams we'll still get testicular cancer we'll still get penile cancer why is
(13:26) that it's because we're men still and we're just laring as women now everyone
(13:31) here knows that they're just suspending reality and choosing to live in a science fiction world where they think
(13:38) men can self-identify as women but the real victims of this are women real
(13:44) women have a right to be in reserved female spaces without trans identified
(13:50) men and they fought long and hard for that right and I think it's kind of peak idiocracy that we're here with men
(13:57) trying to mansplain to women what it is to be a woman I think that's really
(14:03) insulting I think it's really offensive that these two men here are trying to explain what it is to be a woman to
(14:10) millions of women now they know they're wrong they know they're being disingenuous they know their arguments
(14:16) are specious but they're still going to stick to to them because they're in a cult and they want us to capitulate at
(14:21) the altar of the transcult but we're not going to do that and as a trans identified person myself I'm letting you
(14:29) know and you need to respect this that we're just men in makeup and I want to
(14:35) welcome you to the clown show we're all just cosplaying we're all just clowns and anyone who thinks we're really women
(14:41) is a clown too so I hope I can hold up a mirror so that you can self-reflect and
(14:47) see that when this all comes off I'm still just a man at the end of the day and every other trans identified man is
(14:53) just a man at the end of the day now you point to a lot of medical anomalies or
(14:59) medical outliers and say well there's women who don't have this there's women who have this there's women who can't
(15:06) give birth ipof facto trans identified men are women now that's what we call in
(15:12) logic a non sequator it just doesn't follow just because there are medical
(15:19) conditions that make women different than other women doesn't ipsofacto mean
(15:24) that trans identified men are women now most sensient thinking people understand
(15:30) this very basic concept but you seem to get confused by it and think because a woman is born with a disorder that your
(15:38) friend Johnny can self-identify as a woman and magically becomes a woman now
(15:43) since you seem very confused on how this works I just want to lay it out for you as a trans identified man myself that
(15:51) you can't utter a phrase as a man and have a transformative power imbued to
(15:56) you that magically makes you a woman there are men and there are women now
(16:02) what we have are a lot of mentally ill men there's a lot of men again with anorexia that think they're fat at 80
(16:09) pounds there's a lot of schizophrenic men that think the CIA is tailing them
(16:14) in hiding cameras in their toilet there's a lot of men that have psychosis
(16:20) that think they're floating outside their body none of these beliefs are true they're the natural cery of a
(16:27) mental illness and they need to be disabused of these erroneous beliefs they don't need these erroneous beliefs
(16:34) affirmed affirming mentally ill and erroneous beliefs is not kindness It's
(16:40) not compassion you are just further confusing someone who's mentally ill now
(16:46) we don't affirm mentally ill delusions with any category or any group of people
(16:52) other than people who have gender dysphoria that's where the exception has been made where we don't disabuse them
(16:58) their erroneous beliefs but we tell them yes actually you are a man you were born in the wrong body and then we argue that
(17:07) they should be allowed to mutilate themselves or that children should be mutilated so that their fallacious and
(17:12) erroneous beliefs can be affirmed and brought to fruition now again I think most sensient people think that's stupid
(17:20) most sensient reasonable adults don't agree with that the trans movement knows
(17:26) this that's why they're going after kids that's why they're going children's curriculum YouTube kids Disney plus
(17:34) they're going after drag Story Hour with kids because they know most logical
(17:39) sensible rational adults are going to reject the Absurd proposition that men
(17:45) with a mental illness magically become women so they have to indoctrinate the
(17:51) children again as a trans identified man myself I really just want you all to
(17:57) know it's just a mental illness we're just cosplaying we're just dressing up
(18:02) and laring as something we're not but we all know the difference between women and trans identified men now I want you
(18:10) to take my opponent's side if you think I should have full access to a women's bathroom I want you to take my
(18:16) opponent's side if you think I should have full access to a woman's sport I think you should take my opponent's side
(18:21) if you think I should be able to self-identify into female reserved
(18:27) spaces if you think should be able to do all those things please I beg you take
(18:32) my opponent's side if you think that's irrational and you think mental illness
(18:38) for people suffering from gender dysphoria should be treated like any other mental illness in the world then I
(18:45) would urge you to consider what me and my interloc Andrew Wilson have to say I think we're making a pretty solid point
(18:51) that mental illness should be taken seriously it should be treated and we shouldn't sacrifice women's reserved
(18:59) spaces at the expense of mentally ill men we shouldn't continue M hemony
(19:07) patriarchy and misogyny by giving men cart blanch to women's spaces I think
(19:14) that's time I think that's a very basic rudimentary principle and we've observed
(19:21) it as a civilized society for hundreds of years and we should continue to do so
(19:26) so again throughout this debate just look at me and ask yourself should Jay
(19:31) have full access to female Reserve spaces and should millions of other trans identified men have full access to
(19:38) female Reserve spaces if the answer's yes then take my opponent's side if the
(19:44) answer's no take me in Andrew Wilson's side think about it that's all thank you
(19:50) thank you very thank you very much for that opening we are going to kick it Andrew Wilson as well for this remaining
(19:56) several minutes of their opening Andrew the floor is all yours yeah so to the answer to the prompt The
(20:01) Prompt is are trans women women the answer is no very simple no um yeah
(20:07) we're going to get into a semantic distinction what's really funny here though is like these are really old arguments that our opponents bring up
(20:13) really old Arguments for this position uh I'm going to tear all of them apart they have no idea like this is the these
(20:20) are old you're not even with the times guys you you need to get with the times also uh just to beat up on just a little
(20:27) bit right I guess to throw the left us a um a bone here uh Nicole you know when
(20:33) conservatives do this it's [ __ ] cringe you should uh you should never dress up like a woman in order to own
(20:39) the teas and also while it is a good rule to not attack ever another
(20:45) conservative I'm also going to have to say this to you which is um you know
(20:50) ultimately in this idea that you want to mock them right you almost kind of give
(20:56) it a a bit of credit and you really should shouldn't right you shouldn't do that you shouldn't do the Crowder you
(21:01) shouldn't do any of that [ __ ] right you shouldn't do the Alex Stein thing and then you know just to just to
(21:09) kind of throw this last part out I don't give a flying [ __ ] if the if men go into
(21:15) women's sports and beat the holy [ __ ] out of them I don't [ __ ] care women voted for this [ __ ] they overwhelmingly
(21:21) vote to to have men come into their spaces and kick the holy [ __ ] out of them and I just don't give a [ __ ] about
(21:29) it right if they want to lose every one of their sporting events they want to lose everything that they that the
(21:35) stupid ass feminist movement tried to build I don't care right I don't care if
(21:41) they're in the UFC and they get their little brains bashed in I don't give a [ __ ] I don't care if they're in their
(21:47) little uh little swim meets and they get their asses kicked they go home and cry I don't [ __ ] care they voted for the
(21:53) [ __ ] let them deal with it stop going in trying to save these [ __ ] feminists all the time stop it it's bad for us
(22:00) it's bad for the entire conservative movement [ __ ] them let them deal with it let these guys go and kick the holy crap
(22:05) out who cares right that's my position on that so when he says Hey listen to
(22:11) what me and my opponent uh or I'm sorry my partner has to say on this you know
(22:17) if you want if you want men in women's space I don't give a [ __ ] I don't care if women are so stupid that they're
(22:23) actually going to allow men to put on a wig when they have a flopping dick and go in and beat this holy [ __ ] [ __ ] out
(22:28) of them in their own sports why would I give a flying [ __ ] I don't care at all I don't even not even a little bit in fact
(22:35) nobody watches their Sports anyway who cares right and here's the thing you never see it in in the opposite way do
(22:42) you so you're not ever going to see the mdfs come in and uh and and it just
(22:47) really compete you know the or I'm sorry the female to males right you're not going to ever see them come in and really
(22:53) compete with the men like that's never going to happen they get their asses kicked where they're not going to come out on the UFC and fight it out they
(23:00) going to get beat up right it's only ever going to work one way so let them suffer Let Them Suffer bro like let them
(23:07) deal with the consequences of the stuff that it is that they want all right but anyway with that I'll just yield the
(23:14) close let's just get into the arguments these are all old arguments they're all stupid arguments we're going to destroy them quickly go ahead thank you very
(23:20) much want to let you know folks before we jump into the open dialogue we will have a Q&A so if you happen to have questions feel free to submit them in
(23:27) the old live chat with modern day debate otherwise you can use a Super Chat which pushes your question to the top of the
(23:33) list and with that thank you very much gentlemen the discussion is all yours
(23:39) yeah so uh my position is that a woman is an adult human female unless you can demonstrate otherwise I don't even know
(23:46) how we have a debate uh sure let me just like ask what is a female
(23:52) then you you you really want to do that you want to go down each s you want to go down each definitional tree I we can
(24:00) but can we I just want to make sure I just want to make sure before we go down each definitional tree that that's what
(24:06) you want to do because I just want to let you know what what the conclusion of that is going to be right is that we're
(24:13) just gonna end up with two different definitions and you're gonna say I Define it differently than you and that's going to be the end LSP how do
(24:19) you your mother wow you're not wrong yeah I agree with that completely uh I don't we're definitionally locked at two
(24:26) sides so I guess I'm just gonna like uh I guess I guess to give you my definition of woman um one I like to use
(24:33) here give me a second a woman is an adult human with the gender identity of a woman uh and woman itself is a
(24:39) category of people which describes both sex and gender which is usually associated with female okay so you get to decide so the
(24:47) individual gets to decide if they're a female no the individual gets to decide if they're a woman okay and both a
(24:54) social Cate it's a social category okay so woman's is it only a social C or also a biological category that's also a
(25:00) biological category okay so why should we default to the social category over the biological because it's not much
(25:05) easier with language it seems like it's pretty easy I don't see I don't think anybody's confused when they say woman
(25:10) they mean female they don't seem confused have do you see a lot of confusion was there a ton of confusion
(25:15) hang on hang on in the comment was there a ton of confusion or did you did you did you note in your life that when you
(25:22) were walking around and people said woman and it alluded to female that they were confused about it
(25:30) ever okay do you know which one of no idea what when you walk around in your
(25:35) life okay your whole life entirety of your entire life and somebody said the
(25:41) word woman to you and they meant female because they all do almost everybody say woman social category associated with
(25:47) female do you were you ever confused you were never confused ever really you've never been confused about somebody was a
(25:53) woman in your life no what do you mean I guess it's just there's so many
(25:58) people I guess I grew up with where it's like hey you look kind of Andres you can go either way come on it's so rare it's
(26:04) so rare yeah so like can you go can can you come across can you come across a personer people are can you come across
(26:12) can you come across can you come across a person who's like super ugly right you can't tell but you know what you can do
(26:17) you know what you can do you can walk over and be like hey are you a [ __ ] chick or are you not a chick and they' be like well no I'm not a chick and
(26:24) that's it done so like none nobody's confused about this bro who's ever been
(26:29) confused in the history of the world confused obsess over the fact that
(26:35) like you know you can't Define what a woman is or you can't just use like the XX chromosome he never talks about the
(26:40) studies though he never talks about the research the fact that ID don't kind of
(26:46) feel you know use the ID don't kind of feel argument you literally use that argument in the debate in the debate with first amender

(27:51) give Andrew a chance to finish so and maybe 30 seconds and then I promise classy neotic yeah yeah I'll just make it super easy well
(27:58) I don't know if you know how to read but we have a debate prompt the debate prompt is are trans women women not do trans women have autog gyil or do women
(28:06) have autog ailia is that anywhere in the debate prompt the answer is no I don't know why you brought it up clearly you don't know how to debate maybe you just
(28:12) didn't prep for the prompt I don't know or maybe you're trying to do a red herring or you're trying to get me and my debate partner to go down all sorts
(28:19) of illusory path path that have nothing at all to do with the debate prompt can you address the debate prompt
(28:26) now I already did in my but thinging this because you know you can't defend
(28:31) it you know the research doesn't defend that doesn't support your position of course you're got to run away from this
(28:36) topic though it's how chance I'd like to address give you a chance to go into the research uh
(28:42) classy uh Josh I hate to but just since the research came up in terms of
(28:48) specific research that Andrew you feel like he hasn't addressed you think he hasn't address I want to give you a
(28:53) chance to dig into that specific research and then Josh will give you a chance to respond to
(29:01) after classy neurotic the idea so the idea that um that like trans women are just men like they're they're just like
(29:08) you know getting aroused by the idea of like dressing up as women just hasn't actually been proven this was idea like
(29:14) first popularized by the psychologists known as Ray Blanchard uh a lot of transs like him because you know he kind
(29:20) of just like they just kind of like use his arguments but then uh he's actually been disproven many times so there was a
(29:26) a study that's that was shown by it was conducted by Charles W that that where they did a questionnaire with
(29:33) sis or women because Ray plard has only done the questionnaire with transgender
(29:38) women he's never done it with with a with a proper control group group like
(29:43) with biological let me let me just quickly respond I don't give a [ __ ] can we get back to the debate prompt
(29:50) now I think it's just convenient that you're running away from yeah it's convenient that I'm here to debate what
(29:55) the debate prompt is I know it's very convenient this is why it's just a bad prompt because it's like I think women are this
(30:01) I think women are that like if you want to hone in on specific on specific arguments I wouldn't use an autogynephilic argument for to try to
(30:09) claim somebody is or isn't a woman that would be silly even if I were to Grant all of this is true still wouldn't hurt
(30:15) my position who gives a [ __ ] so let's move into something that will hurt my position that would be great okay sure
(30:22) can we address the the overwhelming consensus that trans affirming Healthcare tends to reduce suicidality
(30:28) trans people yeah sure go ahead just my
(30:34) statement true thing um let me look some up yeah
(30:40) because on hand but it's like the reason the reason the reason that you probably should is because you're probably not up
(30:46) to date with the latest studies so here's what you actually will find in the literature that after gender
(30:52) affirming care it is true that there is a reduction in self harm however it goes right back up to 20 x times goes back up
(30:59) 20x times after the initial Euphoria is over you probably didn't know that because you're not keeping up why the
(31:06) literature why does it go back up well so the there's there's a euphoric response uh they don't exactly know why
(31:12) it is this euphoric response happens however it goes back up 20x after the affirming care is done I have study I
(31:20) have study after study that but why that's like very important why they're not they're not sure they're not sure
(31:25) exactly why okay so what's your point do you know what if you're not sure like I I would the obvious reason that
(31:33) IAL rejection yeah you can say that transitioning is not like a a left
(31:39) calm down let's have an actual debate calm down well if you let me finish my point you could have but I wasn't even done with mine I was the one making the
(31:45) point you asked a question actually so I was trying to answer the question so uh
(31:50) if you say well wait a second it's inconclusive that actually makes my point yes it's inconclusive but uh
(31:57) because something is inconclusive uh you would actually have to bite the same bullet that is inconclusive you don't know anything
(32:04) you're about to say is an assertion it is scientifically
(32:09) inconclusive okay I can grant that there are some studies which show that trans affirming care uh can be delerious and
(32:15) also that there's transforming care that is helpful uh that's not a reason to ban transforming care that's a reason to
(32:22) refine how we diagnose it add another doctor right get a second opinion talk to a therapist right
(32:28) the you have to acknowledge there are there are evidence of transform care you would have to show me conclusive data so
(32:35) this would being actual what's your idea of stop stop this would be so this would
(32:41) be a uniformity a consensus-based uniformity within the scientific Community okay
(32:48) that uh X is conclusively conclusively demonstrated
(32:54) to be true this is very hard by the way in the social science is very very rare which is why almost everything that's
(32:59) said in trans debates almost always are assertions you're going to talk about brain scans that's inconclusive too
(33:05) almost everything that you're going to bring up is totally inconclusive currently we have two different standards which we're which we're
(33:11) looking at we have an the uh the British standard we have um we we essentially
(33:17) have the Western Standard and then we have the non-western standard even though these are Western Nations and I can pull these up where here it's okay
(33:25) to do the affirming care as a as a kid and it's recommended in other places that is not the case so this is current
(33:31) literature it's inconclusive we actually don't know we don't even know if the if
(33:36) the affirmative care and by the way this was the warning conservatives gave and it was even the warning some some gay
(33:42) activists gave is that you have to be very careful about saying it's conclusive that affirmations and
(33:47) affirming care right conclusively means that there's going to be a long-term risk reduction in suicidality we now
(33:55) know that is not the case however we don't know why that's not the
(34:01) case okay I am not conclusively saying that trans affirming care is always the right decision right I am acknowledging
(34:08) if you'd let me I am acknowledging that there are two indeed two different branches of study on this that come with opposite conclusions that's not a reason
(34:14) to stop or ban transforming care that's a reason to gather more data right we have evidence that it does help if you
(34:21) stop care you could potentially be making the problem worse if you have care that reduces suicidality and trans
(34:26) youth you have to acknowledge that if you're going to stop that care you're going to have higher rates of trans but the problem is versus hard science where
(34:33) you can come to real conclusions and soft Sciences you don't actually know that you're not just using these kids as
(34:40) uh experiments they're like a petri dish for you so essentially as a petri dish you're like well we'll try this and try
(34:46) that we're going to throw everything at the wall and see what sticks you also have unfortunately in the trans movement
(34:53) uh you have a big problem with certain groups who often fund these studies or who are often at the Forefront uh trying
(35:00) to make advocations who aren't even scientists I mean some of them are like [ __ ] plastic surgeons and [ __ ] like
(35:07) they're not they're not real scientists who are the head plastic surgeon can't do research stop stop let me finish I
(35:13) don't think that you would want a plastic surgeon to be giving you medical
(35:19) advice about heart surgery okay I don't think you would so the thing is like maybe you can say that you would I
(35:25) wouldn't believe you most rational people wouldn't I guess you can say that you would but ultimately what I'm
(35:30) telling you is that there's there's multiple different standards for looking at this none of it's conclusive because it's not conclusive you're actually
(35:35) asking us to make our children into Petri dishes that's what you're actually requesting you say that this is a fight
(35:42) over sovereignty and Over Control uh I would actually say that you're right if
(35:48) it is a control over the family then and you say a person should have a right to
(35:54) allow their child to do gender affirming care shouldn't a person have a right to also tell them they can't I want to jump
(36:00) over to either classy or LSP and then we definitely have to jump over to Josh Josh I know you had something you want
(36:05) to say earlier so I do want to make sure though that I get the left side first so
(36:11) that we don't okay good yes yes I'm not against people saying that they can't uh I'm not saying the government shouldn't
(36:17) be involved I'm saying the government needs to be involved in a more precise way than outright bans right I'm not in
(36:23) favor of giving people trans affirming Medicare if they are in fact not trans if you think that's my position that's not my position I don't believe this
(36:29) care should be given to people who don't need it but for the people who do need it it is shown to help them it is shown
(36:34) to reduce their rates of suicidality if you get rid of this care their rates of suicidality will go up I'm rates of
(36:40) suicidality go back up buddy I let you but they up anyway I don't understand the argument I let you talk the American
(36:48) Medical Association strongly supports uh access to evidence-based gender affirming care and has taken steps to oppose political interference in medical
(36:54) decision- making the American Medical highlights uh the AMA highlight the gender affirm care can be life-saving
(36:59) particularly for transgender youth I'm reading their statement here who face elevated risk of the mental health challenge suicidal ideation now I can
(37:05) believe the American Medical Association or I can believe that guy on the internet well I mean first of all uh
(37:12) citing theama the AMA is also saying that right now it's inconclusive that
(37:18) their their research is inconclusive this is noted that it's inconclusive here's why suicide attempts post post
(37:25) transition in a 10-year period after are 20 times the normal suicide rate of an average person oh is 6% so the thing is
(37:32) is like they're pretty much on track with how they were fre care that's why
(37:38) it's inconclusive now you you look at the middle and you say but because we don't know we should continue right but
(37:43) that's not scientific that that is the opposite of scientific so you can't say that because we lack evidence we should
(37:49) continue until we have evidence to the contrary that would be absurd that would be the opposite of anything that you and
(37:55) I would consider the scientific method so since that's true and it is true and I can give you the studies on it right
(38:01) this second if you'd like you can look it up the suicider related outcomes following gender affirming treatment
(38:07) it's very simple now we have other nations now which are saying they're adopting a standard saying when it comes
(38:13) to affirming care if your kid comes to you and says I'm trans for instance uh instead of affirming that they're trans
(38:19) you can actually say hey look okay you're wearing a dress right uh you know
(38:25) go put on boy clothes something like this and that the outcomes might actually be better right this is what
(38:31) happens when you have inconclusive science and you're letting by the way the the American Med medical association
(38:37) and I think even you would agree with this is part of a political body at this point and it's influenced by politics
(38:43) and it has been influenced by politics for a long time the idea that you're going to take these social soft sciences
(38:49) and then pretend that they're hard Sciences is absurd it's absurd what you have is an affirmation bias you want it
(38:55) to be true and so you're going to like many of The Advocates do fight tooth and
(39:01) nail to make sure that it is regardless of what the actual science says which is inconclusive it's inconclusive so stop
(39:09) telling me what we need to do is a matter of policy or not do as a matter of policy when you have inconclusive
(39:15) science sir okay the American Medical
(39:20) Association statement wasn't that trans care is not conclusive that was not their claim their claim was that uh care
(39:25) can be life- saving for transgender youth that's their plan doing a lot of heavy LIF yeah K of course K's doing a lot of
(39:33) heavy lifting not all people are trans misdiagnoses happen I don't know what you're arguing against but I'm show me
(39:38) the conclusion then I they didn't say it was conclusive I'm not saying you just said it was you
(39:44) just said it was conclusive I just said the opposite my friend so if it's not conclusive then care stop stop I just if
(39:51) well I can't help that you don't care it's I don't care about non-conclusive science why do you okay I fine you don't
(39:57) have to care what I'm saying is the American Medical Association is saying one thing about this in your place guy
(40:04) on the internet who's not convinced to intrude into my child's Healthcare opportunities that's what I'm do you
(40:10) have children you don't belong do you have children yeah I do yeah I have children too and the thing is is that if
(40:15) it is Sovereign to the idea that you are in charge of your child's health care decisions if you want to go and like cut
(40:22) off Little Johnny's Wing wi because he thinks that he's a girl I don't [ __ ] give a [ __ ] right it's just one less
(40:28) reproductive mentally ill dead end right I don't care right doesn't matter to me one way or the other however don't try
(40:35) to tell me that it's scientifically informed because it's not it's inconclusive the science on this is totally inconclusive and by the way it's
(40:41) going to be inconclusive for a long time because it's a basically a brand new phenomenon now you can say ah no no now
(40:48) it's hundreds of years old no we only really started to dive into this phenomenon recently we're talking you
(40:54) know medical research on this as far as the lgbtq groups getting involved and starting the
(40:59) mass funding things like this about 15 years not very long okay and when we were looking at longitudal uh outcomes
(41:07) meaning elongated outcomes over long periods of time we are simply not there to have conclusive data on this man so I
(41:14) I don't know just don't tell me it's a scientific consensus or a scientific inclusion but rather you just want to
(41:20) cut off your kids win if you want to and it's like I could at least accept that argument that at least is better than
(41:25) the one you're giving uh hang on I'm been writing down what
(41:31) you're saying is your argument that you do not want to ban trans Healthcare you just think it's inconclusive that no my
(41:39) my argument here is that is simply this it's not a sci inclusion that you are not utilizing something which is which
(41:47) has some scientific consensus consensus or has a scientific conclusion to it or
(41:53) that it's even the data is conclusive itself rather what you're actually arguing is that you think you have a
(41:59) right as a parent if you think your child wants to be a girl that you can
(42:05) modify their body that's what you're actually arguing so why don't you just say that
(42:11) and stop hiding behind the science because this has nothing to do with science science is inconclusive it's inconclusive sir so why don't you just
(42:18) tell us you want to be able to cut off your kids's [ __ ] junk if you want to and leave it at that uh okay guy yeah I
(42:24) just want to cut off my kids junk and uh but out I don't know how to argue with this
(42:30) like my child has a condition I want my child to get they you're like no I don't
(42:36) want to ban you from that health care just admit that you want to cut their dick off like that's what you're
(42:41) saying that's actually inaccurate I'm saying to you that you don't actually know if your child has the condition
(42:47) because you you can't yeah but they can't scientifically and conclusively tell you
(42:53) that that that's get a second opinion that's stop bro let me respond I just let you go through your whole diet tribe
(42:59) I let you go through your whole diet tribe okay then go through your whole diet tribe and I'll stop and then I'll respond I'm being rude I'm sorry you are
(43:06) you are being kind of rude but anyway I apologize yeah yeah so back back to this what I'm saying is that if you don't
(43:11) have any conclusive scientific data and you don't and none of the doctors have conclusive scientific data either none
(43:17) of them do because they're all going off the same data then any one of them who diagnoses your kid is being some other
(43:24) gender right cannot conclusively tell you that this is so they can't do it so usually what you're use what you're
(43:30) doing is a bunch of guesswork that's what you're actually doing and you're saying based on the guesswork of me and whatever health care professional who
(43:36) are trained by the way by pharmaceutical companies they're trained by various companies that have all sorts of
(43:41) lobbying groups involved with them just so you know and yeah you can look it up don't if you think I'm wrong look it up
(43:47) right now I'll I'll give you the time uh you're saying even though we have no conclusive scientific outcome I want the
(43:53) ability to basically pump my child full of [ __ ] hormones and uh you know give
(43:59) them a dehab condition for the rest of their life because that's exactly what it's going to do if you take your son and you pump them full of estrogen
(44:06) you're going to [ __ ] them up bro and you can pretend that you're not going to [ __ ] them up you can pretend no I'm just
(44:11) helping them affirm uh whatever the uh Soul Fairy Who stuffed the wrong Soul
(44:17) into the wrong body was actually a female soul and he stuffed it in a male body uh but what you're actually doing
(44:23) is you're just [ __ ] them up you just you're just really asking me for permission to [ __ ] your kids up
(44:28) dog I ain't asking you permission for [ __ ] all right I don't answer to you I'm not talking about having conclusive data
(44:35) hang on I let you whine if you don't have conclusive scientific data I mean I'm sorry I'm not claiming I have
(44:40) conclusive scientific data I'm I I want to give uh I want to give
(44:47) ladies and gentlemen he I'm talking on your behalf right now I want to give LSP
(44:52) plenty of time to respond so let's give LSP I would say maybe about two minutes to respond on uninterrupted and then we
(44:59) do have to get to Josh yeah I don't what I want you to do Josh is when LSP finishes in
(45:06) approximately two minutes jump in because I know you had a point you wanted to make earlier and I just want to be sure that we hear it I got enough
(45:12) time to go grab some ice James yeah okay good I need to have a drink while I'm destroying the rest of these
(45:19) DG you think the tough guy act gets him laid every every night you look divorced
(45:27) sure I'm sure I'm going stay my friend peace and love this is a good chance LSP Josh can
(45:35) engage with your arguments as well if you did want to respond to what Andrew just said you got two
(45:40) much I don't know how to respond necessarily that I don't care um his fixation is whether or not I have
(45:47) conclusive scientific data and I've already admitted I don't right science can go both ways uh there's I'm just
(45:52) saying medical organizations which are trusted by doctors professionals who do treat people with the condition my child
(45:59) might have endorse this kind of health care right and they do it for a reason so maybe he don't like it I'm sorry
(46:07) don't stand in my way to do you know from getting that Healthcare but then he's also like I don't care if you do it just to make you want to cut your kid's
(46:13) dick off and I like yeah I mean if that's which how you want to look at it yeah I just want to cut my dick kids dick off it's it's R it's [ __ ] I
(46:19) don't know how to I don't know how to engage with I don't care do do people actually think these are good arguments
(46:25) Josh I want to give you yeah they pay like he Nicole I want to give you a chance if you want to make either your
(46:31) earlier point you were going to make or if you want to respond to what LSP
(46:36) said yeah so just because something punitively reduces the suicide rate of
(46:44) someone struggling with a mental illness it doesn't mean what they're struggling
(46:50) with is factual now the question asked in this debate are trans women
(46:59) women just because suicide rates might go down if they get affirming care
(47:07) doesn't ipof facto mean that they are women they don't magically become women
(47:15) if their suicide rates go down they don't magically become women if it
(47:22) curtails negative symptoms it just means
(47:27) that they got some kind of care that makes them feel better about their
(47:32) delusions if we gave anorexic people affirming lipos suction or affirming
(47:40) diet pills and it reduced their desire to kills it doesn't ipsofacto mean they
(47:48) were fat all along there's no transformative power imbued to the
(47:56) sufferer of of a mental illness just because they were lied to by somebody if
(48:02) a schizophrenic man was lied to and his desire to kill himself decreased it
(48:10) doesn't mean the CIA truly is in his bushes it doesn't mean that FBI is
(48:17) stalking him it just means somebody was disingenuous
(48:23) duplicitous and lied to him that is we're dealing with here just because
(48:30) putatively suicide rates might go down with trans identified men when they are
(48:36) lied to or given affirming care does not mean they are women it just means they
(48:43) are being lied to now we don't lie to and indulge anybody else's erroneous
(48:50) beliefs especially when they're mentally ill but for some reason we make the exception when it comes to trans
(48:57) identified men and women now the question that's asked in the debate is are trans women or trans identified men
(49:05) women well I'll make it easier I'll tell you what the medical guidelines and scientific literature say they say that
(49:12) they're men the guidelines say that trans women are men let's go to NIH NHS
(49:21) who wpath Planned Parenthood transe equality.org or the department of
(49:26) Justice at all if we go to any of them they say that to be a transwoman you
(49:32) simply have to articulate a gender identity which they say is a personal
(49:38) identity that differs from your biological or assigned sex now assigned
(49:44) sex is a euphemism for biological sex it's a specious phrase It's using verbal
(49:50) Ledger domain to be a transwoman all you have to do is articulate a gender
(49:55) identity that differs from your biological sex so what all the guidelines say is trans women are simply
(50:04) men that have articulated a gender identity a female spoken and said I am a
(50:11) female and they a prerequisite of that is they have to be men a prerequisite of
(50:17) being a transwoman is you have to be a man so the guidelines make it very clear
(50:22) that trans women are nothing more than trans identified men who have articulated that they think their gender
(50:30) identity is female and they make it very clear that anyone can say this nobody
(50:36) can question it because it's a personal identity that only the person who has
(50:42) agency over it can articulate and what that means is I am a transwoman now
(50:49) would you guys argue that I'm a woman because over I've articulated a gender
(50:56) identity that differs from my assigned sex at Birth so according to your
(51:02) argument I am a woman or are you actually taking me in Andrew's position and saying that I'm just a trans
(51:09) identified man I think it's very clear all trans women are just trans identified men in the medical literature
(51:16) states that unequivocally okay can I go yes I had my
(51:23) I had my hands on that that was oh wait wait wait I had my hands I wanted to say something I wanted to ask a question um
(51:30) it's really interesting dude stop whining transgender wh is a delusion
(51:35) then how come we don't use anti psychotics to treat um gender dysphoria then maybe we should maybe we should
(51:43) wouldn't that just be easier wait wouldn't that be easier than having to go to a trouble of getting HRT and then
(51:49) getting some really expensive surgery if they can just use antis psychotics okay hang on actually there's
(51:54) there's a great answer for this right and then follow it up with a quick question uh actually some some uh people
(52:00) have dysphoria are treated with anticho okay that's one and then two let
(52:06) me ask you this question very quickly let's say that we had a drug okay uh it
(52:12) was called like dis dysmorphia or something like this okay and you gave it to a trans person and cured them meaning
(52:19) their dysphoria gone would you recommend that it be given to them if it actually works it's their
(52:26) freedom yes they're adults SI no no would you recommend that they be given that drug because it would cure this
(52:33) dysphoria I think they should have a choice why why they're women why they're real women why I well that's hang on
(52:40) yeah this that is that is that is really strange why would there need to be I I I don't I don't get it if if it would take
(52:48) if it would get rid of the problem of dor itself it's gone why wouldn't you recommend they take
(52:53) it because adults have the freedom to do whatever they want to so it really doesn't have anything to do so you just
(53:00) don't think that dysphoria itself uh is is a mental illness at all right you
(53:05) think that that's just part of hang on hang on hang let me ask the question let me ask the question you think it's just
(53:11) part of ontology it's part of who you are as part of your essence part of your being that a gender fairy stuffed the
(53:17) wrong Soul like you're a materialist like how could you demonstrate to me as a materialist that the gender fairy went
(53:23) and stuffed the wrong soul and the wrong body if it's not if it's not a screw loose or it's not a problem upstairs and
(53:29) you could give a pill and it just solved the problem why wouldn't you give them the pill why would you want them to
(53:35) decide in other words to remain mentally ill unless you thought that that was the way that they were supposed to be and if
(53:41) it is the way that they're supposed to be if they're supposed to have dysphoria then you would need to explain to me why
(53:47) we G why we care about it at all they're supposed to have this [ __ ] I think adults have the freedom
(53:54) that like we is your argument that we should force trans people to get Healthcare no why not you Steel Man my
(54:03) argument please you don't know you don't know you don't even know what the argument was so why don't you stay out
(54:09) of it until we finish it then let him answer I'm sorry Namaste my friend well
(54:15) just trust the science the dsm5 says gender dysphoria is a mental illness so I promise you all of us men and being a
(54:22) transwoman a prerequisite of that is you have to be a man not a woman all of us men just have the mental illness of
(54:29) gender dysphoria and we're just men at the end of the day we're not women so that answers the debate
(54:36) question okay um okay well we're we're having like we're dog chill I just let
(54:43) you go it's very it seems like minutes I talk for five minutes dog don't
(54:49) misgender me don't don't be transped that that okay that is very rude to miss gender like that don't be a bigot do not
(54:57) be a bigot how dare you erase my journey how dare you don't be transphobic I
(55:02) won't stand for it okay just because the suicide rate is reduced uh seems enough reason to go
(55:09) with this kind of Health Care and I guess I'm was lost like when I'm listening to your argument they are they
(55:16) women just answer it are they women no they're not women they're trans identified well then that's the end of it that's the end of it that's the end
(55:23) of it thank you thank you win I don't care if you think they're winning or not I'm just saying this health question no
(55:28) you said they weren't women you don't want to have like a more you don't want like a deeper debate than no no as long
(55:35) as you give us hang on hang on as long as you gave us the concession they're not women which you got out of you then
(55:40) I'm happy to move on to whatever else you want to debate sure however you define women that's what they're not okay fair okay okay so transforming care
(55:48) helps you guys just want to say trans women are not women but don't want to block it I'm are you saying conclusively
(55:56) that helps no I'm not saying conclusively then I don't to stop making the affirmative claim that
(56:02) helpa I'm asking you just said okay listen it's not it's not conclusive if
(56:08) it helps it's not conclusive okay it's not conclusive Fair it's not conclusive are you guys going to stand in the way
(56:15) of me getting health care for my child well yes yes yes don't mutilate your
(56:21) baby don't mutilate your child okay that's the part I have an issue with yeah think it's not child ain't your
(56:28) [ __ ] business listen hang on hang on I'll explain I think I think you bring up a rational argument the rational
(56:34) argument and allow me to steal man yours I've actually been listening to you perhaps you'll do me the same favor so you can tell me if I'm wrong in the
(56:40) steal man that you believe that this is critical care that your child
(56:45) potentially could need and that men like me and I guess women I'll put this in
(56:51) quotes like Nicole are trying to block you from said care for your child right
(56:56) is that that is the essential Steelman of your argument is that is that correct what
(57:04) happened he wants to mutilate his child he's mad what what what happened where'd he go what the
(57:14) [ __ ] he's mad he can't mutilate his child and he thinks we should let
(57:22) him I I don't know I don't know where where he went I we were just getting into it we're just getting into it James
(57:28) you got to get him back you got to get him back James I don't know what happened he's he left it looks like uh I
(57:35) thought it maybe maybe a connection issue that's what I was thinking I think he's mad that he capitulated and said
(57:40) that trans identified men are just men who would have thought he did capitulate that's true classy if you'd like to jump
(57:47) in in the meantime let me just see if there's an email that said he got removed um I do see
(57:55) LS LSP I don't know if you can hear me sorry about that actually he's still on the zoom call now I I don't know if he
(58:01) just perhaps uh perhaps he needed a snack you know you got to have some stamina for a show like this maybe he
(58:06) has anorexia and we should indulge and affirm his delusional beliefs I think that's what he's arguing for dude you
(58:12) are sleeved up bro what the [ __ ] you're sleeved up I mean ma'am oh my God man
(58:18) again can you believe that I was a man the whole time believe I was a man the whole time we're all
(58:25) men hear me hold on LSP are you
(58:30) there let me check the chat uh a couple messages uh classy you wouldn't happen
(58:36) to have his number or something would you like I you think I'm messaging him right
(58:42) now gotcha see oh his Zoom crashed okay oh
(58:47) screen crashed after he capitulated that's it makes sense that his Zoom is still in this call even though he's got
(58:54) cut off on that side so classy this is your chance to make your case before we
(59:00) do go into the Q&A shortly I'm going to the screen is scrambled up but I'm going to fix that right now so folks thanks
(59:06) for your feedback in the chat on that classy will give you a chance to make your case I think we should clarify a
(59:11) little bit about what we mean with gender affirming care for children though because when I look at the guidelines though and this is straight
(59:16) from the Human Rights Campaign which was in collaboration with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American
(59:23) College of osteopathic uh pediatricians it is important to understand that for children who have not reached puberty
(59:29) gender transition involves no medical inter interventions at all it consists of social changes like name pronouns and
(59:36) gender expression so I think we should like clarify that it's a wrong premise to say that like oh we want to like hang
(59:42) on let's let's see let's see if this is a fair analogy okay if is it the case then that
(59:48) you're saying that until a person's 18 years old there should be no intervention hor with hormones or
(59:54) anything else with a child until they reach 18 years old I would
(59:59) support people blockers but I wouldn't okay well then well then then stop right your your argument makes no sense if
(1:00:05) you're saying that you want Med that is medical intervention and that particular form of
(1:00:11) medical intervention uh will definitely stop the way that you typically would form as a human being you would agree
(1:00:18) that that is true yeah the difference is that puberty blockers are reversible and
(1:00:24) they can go on to but they can still cause puberty and they can still cause signific damage in the interim time any
(1:00:31) anytime you uh block normal puberty inside of a child you're going to cause
(1:00:37) some type of physiological problem now you can say that that problem can be reversed it's not going to be able to be
(1:00:43) reversed in everybody and you can never you can't demonstrate that even if we had such a reversal at our disposal that
(1:00:50) those critical years for formation would not have been stunted and it's still inconclusive would you at least least
(1:00:56) agree with me that it's inconclusive I would say it's inconclusive and that's why it's
(1:01:01) important that we have these conversations between the parent and the physician and the the case for every single individual is going to be
(1:01:08) different do you think a child with type 1 diabetes can just walk into a clinic and just like ask for insulin on Dem no
(1:01:14) but it's very no but it's very conclusive that if a child with type 1 diabetes doesn't get care they're going
(1:01:19) to die and it is not conclusive here at all that if you put these kids on any
(1:01:27) type of puberty blocker that they will it's not conclusive even that it's good for them we don't have conclusive data
(1:01:34) here and so ultimately uh as as we kind of like let's let's go through this I I
(1:01:41) want you to think about what you're asking us to do if I had a neighbor who was abusing their kid they were hurting
(1:01:47) them in some way I believe as a Christian that I have a moral ethical
(1:01:53) duty to step in and so does my debate partner I promise you okay I can tell you right now I I I don't know the guy
(1:02:00) never even met him I have a gut feeling though that he would see it as an obligatory duty to step in and stop set
(1:02:07) abuse and so just like you I wouldn't blame you or fault you if you went to a Christian couple who was praying over a
(1:02:14) kid with type 1 diabetes rather than getting them treatment calling the state and having the state assist in removing
(1:02:21) them so that they could get said treatment because that is a horrific form of abuse
(1:02:26) uh that's what you're actually asking us to do you're asking us to sign on for what we would consider to be abusive
(1:02:33) it's inconclusive science we know it's inconclusive science so that's what you're really asking us to do so I wish
(1:02:39) you'd just be honest and ask us to do that well like we have to look at this
(1:02:45) with risk be uh risk benefit uh analysis though so it's inclusive what the risk
(1:02:53) is that they could delay their puberty and the benefit is that it reduces their chances of self harm or or or self I
(1:03:00) think maybe you don't know what inconclusive means when it comes to science I know what inconclusive okay
(1:03:05) great great it is inconclusive we don't actually know that you stepping in is
(1:03:13) going to be good or bad we don't know that with type 1 diabetes hang with type
(1:03:19) one diabetes we definitely [ __ ] know we definitely know we definitely know if you walk over your kid with a big hammer
(1:03:26) and he hit him in the [ __ ] head with it it's definitely going to be bad right we have conclusive scientific evidence
(1:03:32) for these things in this case you do not have a scientific consensus nor
(1:03:37) conclusion on any of this data that says that you not stepping in to give puberty
(1:03:43) blockers to a child is going to in some way hurt that child you say there's some evidence for it so what there's some
(1:03:50) evidence that Kellogg's Frosted Flakes is good for a balanced breakfast who gives a [ __ ] I want conclusive data okay
(1:03:58) I don't want Tony the Tiger I don't want yellow 5 I don't want people to say hey in some ways Yellow 5 is good for you I
(1:04:04) don't want Tony the Tiger to tell me that the Frosted Flakes are the best way to balance my vitamin C for breakfast I
(1:04:11) want conclusive data do you have it or not we don't have conclusive data but it
(1:04:16) should still be an option if there's evidence that it could possibly problem I want to jump in here the the problem
(1:04:22) with that classy is unlike diabetes which is an objective concrete real
(1:04:29) disorder diagnosis disease and a lot of other things that people have high blood
(1:04:35) pressure all of these things are tangible concrete things that cannot be
(1:04:42) a figment of someone's imagination they can't be a product of malingering they
(1:04:48) can't be a product of munch housing by propy the problem with trans ideology
(1:04:55) and postmodern gender ideology it's not concrete so we don't know not only which
(1:05:01) adults but which kids truly have this thing whereas with diabetes high blood
(1:05:09) pressure we know they objectively factually have these things
(1:05:16) it is so amorphous so nebulous and the trans movement has ensured that it's so
(1:05:25) vague and morphus that anyone can kind of self-identify into it that's where
(1:05:30) the problems occur classy because we don't know who's mingering we don't know which kid is a product of munch hous and
(1:05:36) by proxy so for you to assume that the kid genuinely has gender dysphoria or
(1:05:43) genuinely as trans you're making a big presupposition a big assumption that
(1:05:48) they do in fact have that thing and you don't know that and none of us know it
(1:05:54) and that's why this issue guys is so nuanced because we're not talking about an objective disorder it's
(1:06:01) something anyone can self-identify into and I would argue that's why it's so pernicious and so nefarious and why we
(1:06:08) need to really have great circumspection and great caution when addressing it and we should not rush into
(1:06:17) life alterations for children be sure that the time is split evenly is I want
(1:06:23) to be sure that classy is not being ganged on time wise so even though uh LSP is still trying to get his Zoom
(1:06:30) working again LSP or uh classy I do want to give you a lot of time to respond to
(1:06:35) both Andrew and Josh so I'll give you a couple maybe even several minutes here
(1:06:41) to respond to everything that you just heard and I'm sure LSP will be back any moment because he did email me saying
(1:06:46) he's trying to get back in but he's having trouble yeah okay so let me reiterate my
(1:06:53) point we are looking at this from a risk benefit
(1:06:58) analysis what is the risk and what is the benefit and when you're talking about
(1:07:03) like other diseases like let's say like diabetes you know you can look at people's glucon levels or insulin levels
(1:07:08) and stuff like that and like diagnos them there are also many diseases that uh you would say are concrete like
(1:07:14) certain types of cancers that have absolutely no cures there are just no cures we have treatments but these
(1:07:20) treatments might have really adverse side effects it might make the patient feel worse off but you would still
(1:07:29) Advocate that it should still be an option for them if the parents think it's appropriate yeah what we're saying
(1:07:37) is that it should be an option that they can pursue if the Physicians and the
(1:07:43) parents think that the uh benefit outweighs the
(1:07:48) risk one second hold on just a second Josh I do want to be sure that classy has enough CH enough time so that he
(1:07:55) feels that he's given an equal amount of time relative to what you and Andrew just took so totally fair totally hold
(1:08:02) on Fair so classy do you have any other points that you wanted to
(1:08:07) make uh I think I made my point clear also lb says he's gonna join back in you
(1:08:13) got it all right Josh I think you had something to say go ahead I was just I was just saying again
(1:08:19) we can't know if the 5-year-old genuinely has gender Foria or is
(1:08:26) genuinely trans whatever that means we are going based off mostly what the
(1:08:31) parent is saying so again you cannot analogize it to something like diabetes
(1:08:37) heart disease these other things we know the person has it because the whole problem
(1:08:43) with this movement is it is a figment of people's mostly adults imagination so we
(1:08:50) never know if the kid really even has anything so we should always air on the side of
(1:08:56) caution how do we know if a kid has autism I would argue there's probably
(1:09:02) some misdiagnosis with that also but if you look at the medical guidelines from wpath NIH NH HS who they say whoever
(1:09:11) articulates a gender identity that differs from their biological sex is
(1:09:16) trans and I would argue that can cause a lot of people to be misdiagnosed in even
(1:09:22) more so than something that's already misdiagnosed in autism Asbergers or
(1:09:27) anything else there's always that possibility but I would say it is raised when it comes to this issue and that is
(1:09:34) what makes it so pernicious okay but I'm not using those guidelines I'm using the guidelines from
(1:09:39) the Human Rights Campaign which is in collaboration with the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College
(1:09:45) of osteopathic Pediatrics and it makes a distinction between what are uh gender expansive Behavior such as children
(1:09:51) whatever a boy that wants to play with dolls a girl that wants to play with monster trucks and also children who
(1:09:57) actually have gender dysphoria and it doesn't recommend the fact that we just automatically treat gender dysphoria
(1:10:03) that we at least explore the possibility that they may just be
(1:10:08) expressing uh gender behaviors that are different that are they typically uh you would typically assign U typically
(1:10:16) expect from a boy or a girl I would argue that there was an explosion if
(1:10:22) there was an explosion in the number of anorexic children or an explosion in the
(1:10:27) number of schizophrenic children at the same time that affirming care was being
(1:10:33) offered for these children we would all be justified in asking if there was a causal link between the affirming care
(1:10:40) in this explosion in anorexic and schizophrenic children we see the same phenomenon happening here there's been
(1:10:47) an explosion of reputative trans kids at
(1:10:52) the same time that affirming care has snuck into the medical community and the
(1:10:57) literature and School curriculum and I think people are Justified and probably
(1:11:03) correct in questioning if there is a causal link and we are getting less care
(1:11:09) for people that have something and more grooming and converting going on and I
(1:11:14) would argue it's the latter so as medicine and research advances our
(1:11:20) diagnosis capabilities actually improves and just as you say that there's this explosion of everyone being trans
(1:11:26) there's some people also argue oh there's this explosion of people having ADHD oh there's this explosion of people
(1:11:32) having autism you don't think it's possible that our diagnosis uh uh ability to make diagnosis actually
(1:11:39) improved and also just the fact that like um our attitudes toward different uh gender uh um uh behaviors and
(1:11:46) expression has also changed well actually no I I would have to counter this by saying no I think the opposite
(1:11:53) is true as the science has gotten better as more and more people have been looking at this issue our ability to
(1:12:00) diagnose has not improved in fact it's just as inconclusive as the day we
(1:12:05) really started to go down the path of trying to identify these various gender issues everything from braid scans being
(1:12:12) inconclusive and they are quite inconclusive to the science you're now citing being inconclusive now you brought you brought
(1:12:19) up a pretty I think is a fair point right let's look at the idea of uh you
(1:12:25) know something like autism some something you know that's there's a lot of kids who are diagnosed now with
(1:12:31) autism but the the question here becomes is that even a fair diagnosis right is
(1:12:38) it the case that they're being diagnosed with autism and they actually have it or not well a lot of that's inconclusive
(1:12:45) too so we have to be very careful right when we go down these different Pathways but I will say that there's more science
(1:12:52) at least that would affirm the idea that autism or that you have autism then
(1:12:58) science that would affirm that your brain somehow maps onto that of a brain
(1:13:03) of a woman there's not any good conclusive evidence for that none zero
(1:13:09) so the question I have for you is just this you're a materialist as a materialist how can you
(1:13:17) make the claim that the wrong soul is stuffed into the wrong body you would have to make the claim
(1:13:24) instead that that you're developing along the pathway that you're supposed to be developing
(1:13:30) along there's no other way around that so if that is the case as a materialist
(1:13:36) why is it that we should affirm any of this with inconclusive science
(1:13:41) why I'm not saying it's conclusive and I'm saying my my argument is that this
(1:13:46) should be an option as this could be one halfway why
(1:13:52) should it be an option yeah but it could also not work but it also could not work
(1:13:58) and if it could not work it could do a amazing amounts of damage even from a utilitarian worldview it could do huge
(1:14:06) amounts of damage to block a child's Pathway to puberty like that's I can't even think
(1:14:13) like can you imagine your dad comes into you one night and he says we're gonna block your pathway to puberty and you go
(1:14:21) well that could be helpful I'll Grant it maybe it could be but have to Grant the
(1:14:26) other way that it may be extraordinarily harmful if that is the case we don't
(1:14:32) make medical decisions that way you need to have you need you need you need to
(1:14:37) give me some some degree of certainty here some degree of certainty you know when I take an ibuprofen I have some
(1:14:43) degree of certainty that shit's going to get rid of my [ __ ] headache okay I need something give me
(1:14:50) something I just want to say the hang on hang on hang on let him respond I don't I don't want him to feel like he's
(1:14:55) railroaded the 2 v1s kind of suck you know I get it I don't want you to feel
(1:15:00) railroaded please answer my question sir I don't have a response uh when you
(1:15:05) don't have a response you don't have a response I just want to say I just want to say me and Andrew are taking the
(1:15:11) passive position that we shouldn't allow people to mutilate their kids because of
(1:15:17) that the onus is not on me and Andrew to prove anything the onus I think Andrew
(1:15:23) and classy would agree is on you guys the proponents of child mutilation and
(1:15:30) body mutilation to prove that there is overwhelming evidence that justifies it
(1:15:36) you have not done that you have tacitly admitted you can't and I just want to
(1:15:42) reiterate you are taking the extreme position that we should be in favor of Mutilation me and Andrew are taking the
(1:15:49) position that we should not do that because of that the onus is on you to provide overwhelming evidence and you
(1:15:56) can't and you've also admitted that trans identified men are just men and they're not women and I think that sums
(1:16:02) up the debate and answers the questions but you're misrepresenting my view I'm
(1:16:07) basing my view based on the guidance from the Human Rights Campaign which doesn't recommend surgical intervention
(1:16:13) for minors it recommends that if they do have G for to explore the social
(1:16:20) transitioning and also possibly puberty blockers so no I I don't support genital m mutilations and I support restri
(1:16:27) surgical intervention want just to be sure that just to be sure that classy you feel
(1:16:32) like you gotten to say everything you wanted to say yeah you got pardon my Interruption
(1:16:37) Josh I uh I know I'm being like extra protective I just want to be for sure that he doesn't feel like he's not getting enough time go ahead Josh pardon
(1:16:44) my Interruption I would just say I will assume arguendo what you're saying we will say
(1:16:51) no transition no invasive surgery but just what you're arguing for home
(1:16:57) hormones and talking to the child about it I would argue I'm not advocating for hormones for minor hormones for a miners
(1:17:05) what are you advocating talking to them about gender ideology talking to them about the
(1:17:11) possibility of exploring the possibility of social transitioning and possibly puberty blockers but I'm not advocating
(1:17:18) for homo you understand there's the difference between puberty blockers and hormone of replacement therapy I do I do
(1:17:25) understand that I I I have a very simple question for you here sure have you ever heard of the Salem Witch Trials yes who
(1:17:32) were the who what was the demographic of people who were the most likely to give
(1:17:37) false testimony um was it possibly the women I could be
(1:17:44) wrong it was the children children okay why why did the children have Fantastical Tales to tell about
(1:17:52) witches um because they are uh prone um because
(1:17:59) they're uh um they getting close I I I know where you're what you're getting at
(1:18:04) can you tell me why it is that you think that the children were the most likely to give false
(1:18:10) testimony because children are susceptible to uh suggestion ideas yeah
(1:18:15) suggestion ideas you can convince them Santa Claus is real you can convince them werewolves are outside the door you
(1:18:22) can convince them of everything under the sun and those of us who have children know this very well so I need
(1:18:27) to ask you again if you have no conclusive scientific data and you're giving this suggestion to a child that
(1:18:32) the child may not be what the child thinks it is then you perhaps could be
(1:18:38) creating a suggestion that that child may never have had
(1:18:44) yes but I don't see what is the harm of social transitioning if they can very easily reverse back to whatever gender
(1:18:51) role or which means they're noten they're not women they're just boys so you just admitted they're not women if
(1:18:57) they can some of them are just gonna be boys but some of them may end up to growing up to be trans women transgender
(1:19:03) women you said they could very easily go back to being boys so it's not that harmful if they don't have gender for or
(1:19:09) if the social transitioning isn't working out for them and is Santa Claus real no how hard would it be for you to
(1:19:16) convince a child it was well they would have to either grow out of it or you know uh how hard would
(1:19:24) it be for you to convince a child that Santa Claus was real I don't know it depends on the
(1:19:30) child depends like on how if you had a guess just give me give me your best guess give me your best guess depends on
(1:19:37) the age too right because like some children are like really young they probably won't be able to change if we're talking about like maybe yeah give
(1:19:42) me your best guess bro uh I guess it depends on the age do
(1:19:48) you think that you could convince do you think you could could convince a 10-year-old Santa Claus was
(1:19:56) could you convince a 10-year-old that Santa Claus is VI maybe it would
(1:20:01) probably be a lot easier than convincing a 40y old I would think it might be a
(1:20:07) little bit easier yeah 30-y old might be a little bit easier depend
(1:20:13) 18y old well it depends on the culture too I me okay well we're talking about the culture that we're in we're talking
(1:20:19) about the culture we're in in the United States do you think it's hard to convince a 10-year-old Santa Claus is
(1:20:24) real it's possible is it hard to convince a
(1:20:31) 10-year-old Santa Claus is real sir give me the real answer come
(1:20:36) on don't [ __ ] me hard would it be to convince a 10-year-old that a big fat
(1:20:42) guy who has elves in the North Pole flies around all year and goes down the
(1:20:48) chimney and leaves Christmas presents under your Christmas tree how hard is that it can't be hard because almost
(1:20:56) every child in the 1950s 60s and 70s believed that [ __ ] almost all of
(1:21:01) them believed it because kids are totally suggest suggestible so the question becomes how much of this that
(1:21:09) you're talking to your child about becomes suggestion when is it that they think well Daddy thinks I'm a girl Daddy
(1:21:17) thinks that I'm not correct they look to you for guidance you can be you can you
(1:21:23) can convince kids of Ane [ __ ] in fact I'll give you a story very quick story it's an anecdote you can dismiss it but
(1:21:29) very quick story uh [ __ ] with kids is hilarious okay don't get me wrong it's really
(1:21:36) really funny to convince them of [ __ ] that is absolutely not true like for
(1:21:42) instance one time uh it was one of my kids was about five and I was like don't
(1:21:47) go down into the basement she said why and I said because if you go down there a vicious evil monster is going to eat
(1:21:53) your face and I'm going to laugh cuz I was the one who told you not to go down there and she was like [ __ ] that I'm not
(1:21:58) going down to that basement was there ever a vicious monster in the basement of course not of course not did I find
(1:22:06) it hilarious that I was able to convince this 5-year-old of this did I Pat myself in the back absolutely but the point is
(1:22:13) you can convince kids of all sorts of irrational nonsensical things their
(1:22:19) minds are like sponges so I need to ask you if if you take into account how
(1:22:24) suggestible kids are don't you think if you have inconclusive science that you as the parent by just simply saying to
(1:22:32) them let's talk about your gender could be introducing suggestions that they would not ordinarily have in
(1:22:40) life no I think the research shows that like they can actually that most of the
(1:22:45) time they end up just going back to their original gender role yeah why why
(1:22:50) do they end up going back the but what's the harm with soci why do they end up going back you just made my point for me
(1:22:55) why did they end up going back because it just wasn't the right uh because it was based around
(1:23:01) suggestion and here's the thing we have good evidence it was based around suggestion is it conclusive no it's not
(1:23:09) conclusive I'm not going to tell you that it was that that's the reason because it's still inconclusive because
(1:23:15) all this science is [ __ ] inconclusive but you and I at least can admit kids
(1:23:21) are highly suggestible my point is that the evidence is
(1:23:27) inconclusive but it should still be an option because of the risk benefit we
(1:23:33) don't know the risk or the benefits because it's inconclusive we do know the risk and the benefits okay then risk
(1:23:39) isang I just want to know I just want to make sure I got this right we have
(1:23:44) conclusive data it's good scientific conclusion is this can
(1:23:51) you guys hear me it cut off for like can yeah okay we good we have a scientific
(1:23:57) conclusion I just want to I just want to make sure we have conclusive data that when you do these medical interventions
(1:24:03) they're going to work out right I think there's going to be situations where it's not going to be
(1:24:10) conclusive but you're still gonna have an option that could possibly have a better benefit I want to chime in here
(1:24:16) prove it okay prove it wait want to hear what Josh has to
(1:24:22) say yeah no I want you to prove your claim so the claim is that there's some
(1:24:28) studies the some studies say shows that it reduces su su suity and S self harm
(1:24:35) and there's other studies that say that doesn't that the suicidality climbs back up 20x after a small period of euphoria
(1:24:42) yeah okay I want I want to see a link to that study if you can send it to me I'll just do is LSP has entered the chat I am
(1:24:49) going to fix the video as OBS is now scrambled but LSP this is your chance
(1:24:56) since you haven't been here for quite a while assuming you can hear me to give an argument based on assuming that
(1:25:03) you've been listening or maybe you wanted to give before you got cut off I I have can you guys hear me yes yeah we
(1:25:08) can hear I'll be right back okay before this whole chat I made a joke about Jesus knowing what it's like to get
(1:25:14) [ __ ] and uh this is punishment by God all right um yes I was listening I'm sorry this was um wait this was um this
(1:25:22) was like a lot of STW maning it's like funny it's like the argument is consistently well it's not conclusive
(1:25:29) it's it's not conclusive and our argument is like it doesn't have to be we don't care right we want this kind of
(1:25:34) healthcare to be accessible and then every time we try to like ask you guys like you st in the way it's sort of like him and Hong in yes and no so I'm G just
(1:25:40) like I'm G just like make it like much much much [ __ ] clear right uh none of
(1:25:45) your arguments are an argument for Banning transing Healthcare it's an argument for getting second opinions and we're not against that right so um we
(1:25:53) have a pretty good idea at least you might not be satisfied we do that transform care helps people who need it
(1:25:59) right not saying it's conclusive not saying it's conclusive right if that's
(1:26:04) inclusive can't prove it okay I can't prove it but we are I don't care you can't prove your claim I don't give a
(1:26:10) [ __ ] bro I don't care this is like sad it's like well I
(1:26:17) win the debate because I don't care it's like we're having two different debates dog like no we're not we're not we're
(1:26:22) not having two different debates I believe that if you bring me inconclusive if you bring me
(1:26:27) inconclusive data for a medical procedure which could stunt the entirety
(1:26:33) of a human adult's life when they're children that is a medical Intervention
(1:26:38) which potentially could be non necessary it's not conclusive that necessary at all it's inconclusive then it's fine for
(1:26:46) me to step in and say no you can't abuse your kids I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm me
(1:26:53) hang
(1:26:58) back earlier let me finish earlier not your place to step in yeah you can yeah
(1:27:04) it is my place to step in I have a d you are not the parent of my [ __ ] child dog right you are guy on the
(1:27:30) [ __ ] it's just yes no so is what I'm complaining
(1:27:38) about is we're having two different debates he's just saying he doesn't care because I don't have conclusive proof that like transforming care like helps I
(1:27:44) don't answer to Andrew right I'm talking to doctors or medical professionals who who've gone to school for this and I'm
(1:27:50) more inclined to accept their opinion than the [ __ ] guy on the internet right if all he's going to do is stand on the
(1:27:56) sidelines and say I don't care you just want to cut your dick off well then he wants the [ __ ] debate because I think what I'm [ __ ] arguing right I'm
(1:28:02) saying there are certain healthare options that people should be allowed to pursue because I don't want to live in a world where these [ __ ] morons get to
(1:28:08) dictate what healthare I get access to that's [ __ ] terrifying this guy's a lunatic do people actually think this is
(1:28:14) an equal debate I'm sorry there go sorry they do think it's an equal debate
(1:28:20) and they think you lost and here's why so here I am stupid me asking you to
(1:28:26) give conclusive scientific data that before you I don't know mutilate and stunt the growth of your child and do
(1:28:32) all sorts of horrible things to them that you demonstrated to society you may think that I have no claim to step in
(1:28:38) but if you were I don't know molesting your child I would step in on that too if you were doing horrible things to your child I would step in on all of
(1:28:44) that and I think that I have a moral duty to do so and I have the gun of the federal government at my back and Donald
(1:28:50) J Trump who was recently elected [ __ ] and we're going to make D I'm sure that you can't hurt the kids whether you like
(1:28:56) it or not welcome to authoritarianism [ __ ] I hope you enjoy
(1:29:02) it no I don't think anybody would enjoy your system you sound well they're already [ __ ] enjoying it they're
(1:29:08) already enjoying it go eat a [ __ ] donut let the adults handle things go eat the donut and let adults handle things one thing I do want to be S it's
(1:29:15) like you have no argument so it's like all you could say is it's I already beat you you already conceded to everything
(1:29:20) there's nothing more to win we already won cavan holy [ __ ] all right you in buddy what we'll do is we'll jump into
(1:29:27) the Q&A but I do want to mention I pardon if you said it and I didn't hear it uh LS I cannot get the camera working
(1:29:34) I I don't know what's going on with my [ __ ] not a big deal it's powered by jales I just didn't hear it earlier but
(1:29:40) uh that was probably my fault so glad to have you back nonetheless in this debate I'm going to jump into these questions
(1:29:45) want to say folks thank you very much for your questions if you happen to have any you can submit them via the live
(1:29:51) chat if you tag me with @ modern day debate otherwise Super Chat pushes your question to the top of the list this one coming in by the way Josh I know you got
(1:29:57) wait sorry sorry before you start I want to say something it's not related to the debate or anything but like Chad I knew
(1:30:02) this debate was going to get spicy so guess what I brought the milk chat I brought the milk it got spicy it got so
(1:30:09) spicy I brought the milk but yeah all right let's go on sorry you should feel so [ __ ] terrible for that joke dude
(1:30:15) even Nicole the woman in the room is cringing and how cringe that [ __ ] was
(1:30:20) that you just did you socially awkward degener it
(1:30:25) stop defitely God live for cring we'll jump into the Q&A with that uh Josh as
(1:30:33) he mentioned and we got to go in 23 minutes so I'm going to move fast sunflower says this debate is about Freedom versus control they say this is
(1:30:39) what LSP says then he says why can't people be transracial then is that topic also about Freedom versus
(1:30:48) control okay is that a question for me yes uh I kind of think I mean cl to
(1:30:54) think it is right I this is like an entirely new phenomena so you got people like Rachel dozol who actually has seen
(1:30:59) a therapist that's kind of affirmed this condition I think there's actually been other documented cases it seems ridiculous on its face but there are
(1:31:06) doctors looking into this I don't see any reason why we should stop Nick's that field of study like I don't know
(1:31:12) what what are you gonna you're not black like is it conclusive that Rachel Doo's
(1:31:18) black bro [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] coming in from
(1:31:27) Satan they say if I disguise my dog as a cat and it responds excitedly to me
(1:31:32) calling it cat is it still a dog or is it a cat is naming convention the only
(1:31:46) measure so they uh I think this is for LSP and classy they say if I disguise my
(1:31:53) dog as a cat and it responds excitedly to me
(1:31:59) calling it cat in other words like he dresses up his his uh dog as a cat and
(1:32:04) then he starts calling it a cat and it responds excitedly to him when he calls it a cat is it still a dog hold what you
(1:32:11) shut up so I can finish this is it still a dog it's very rude to interrupt people he says is it still a dog or is it a cat
(1:32:19) is naming convention the only measure yeah I'm sorry I I my audio cut out when I was trying to respond to that the
(1:32:25) first time and then it just cut back in I wasn't trying to be rude I'm so sorry oh okay no problem that happens my
(1:32:31) everything's [ __ ] on my [ __ ] uh no I when I this like such a boring argument because it's
(1:32:36) like it's just so obsessed with like the semantics of things like no your dog is
(1:32:42) not a cat right we have these words it mean separate things nobody's arguing that I I don't know how to engage with
(1:32:48) that like if if your fascination with saying trans women aren't I here's what I'll say you want to say trans women aren't women fine trans women aren't
(1:32:55) women they ain't men they don't behave like men they don't act like men they don't identify like men they don't dress
(1:33:00) like men there is something else with them you want to say there's a biological component to being man or woman there's also a neurobiological
(1:33:07) component to being a man or a woman and trans women aren't Men by that metric alone the fact they don't identify as
(1:33:13) men makes them not men right like like Nicole over here dude there's an egg
(1:33:19) around that guy that's what I'm saying right um then the fact that I identif a tree makes me not a
(1:33:26) man yes that's exactly what I said thank you no no it is it is actually what you just said was the fact that they don't
(1:33:31) identify as men makes them not men if that is the case why can I logically extend that to if I identify as a tree
(1:33:38) I'm not a man either this is like the most boring
(1:33:44) debate it's like you didn't listen to a thing you don't have answer have an answer [ __ ] answer stop it's the
(1:33:50) exact answer I gave with dog like it's the same exact answer I gave with dog if you didn't a dog I don't know what to do for you you got nothing you got nothing
(1:33:57) you're right I got nothing all right you win I got nothing this one coming in from do appreciate it even Lord says is it better to talk slow and clear or fast
(1:34:04) and Mumble also if I want to get into debating where is a good place to start
(1:34:10) uh and learn the rules uh I'll answer that at the end so I want to stay focused on the debate
(1:34:15) they said is it better to talk slow and clear or fast and mumbled I think it's um it's about me
(1:34:23) yeah yeah I I I definitely talked way too fast in the beginning for my in I think I was so scared that like I was going to like run out of time but I yeah
(1:34:30) I think it's a good idea to uh speak slow and clear the only thing is if you can speak fast and clear it makes you
(1:34:36) look like a really good debater so that's why like people like Ben Shapiro or even Desy like if there's like good
(1:34:41) debate BR uh you know sort of like image of themselves because they could speak fast and clear yeah you got it this one
(1:34:49) coming in from do appreciate your question even Lord also asked if a person has recovered from a atic event
(1:34:54) through believing in Christianity and is an active evangelist is it immoral to not affirm their
(1:35:04) God who was that question for I it's for you or classy whichever one would like
(1:35:10) to take it or both oh I don't know what like you morally obligated you should just respect their beliefs like if they
(1:35:17) want to believe in God more power to you no but if you don't believe in my God I'm GNA kill myself
(1:35:24) sorry buddy oh well then I guess I guess you don't so so when when it comes down to like I said this comes down control
(1:35:31) you affirming my truth that's not okay I have to affirm your truth and the threat
(1:35:37) of if you don't I'll kill myself doesn't seem to work in this instance against you it only works in this instance
(1:35:43) against me I'm not asking you to affirm that any truth about anything buddy you
(1:35:48) were entitled to your opinions I'm just telling you to get the [ __ ] out of the way if you hadn't picked that up yet I don't know what to do we've been doing
(1:35:53) yeah got him got him this from strudel Slayer unless uh classy if you ever want
(1:36:01) to respond because sometimes you can both respond to a question just jump in just yeah can I can I just respond I
(1:36:06) want to say something real quick so I actually disagree with Elby in this point because I think the research shows that like people who like believe in God
(1:36:12) and religion and like you let them uh you know like use that as like part of
(1:36:17) the treatment it actually helps them so like no I wouldn't in any way like tell them that like they're wrong when it
(1:36:22) comes to if it actually but I need you to affirm it I need you to say Jesus Christ is the Lord God I need you to say
(1:36:29) Jesus Christ is the Lord God if you don't then there's at least a small percentage that it's going to increase
(1:36:36) the chances that I'm going to unive myself now say it say it say Jesus
(1:36:41) Christ is God say it why won't you say it bro why won't you say it bro
(1:36:49) why okay Jesus Christ is God go better all I mean I I I don't feel like
(1:36:55) you didn't say it with conviction you said it Snidely can you say it with conviction can you tell can you convince me that you actually believe Jesus
(1:37:01) Christ is God oh Lordy Jesus Christ is Lord you see you see how you mock me and my beliefs and that makes me want to
(1:37:08) unli myself why won't you just why won't you just capitulate why won't you just capitulate I don't know how much more I
(1:37:14) could capitulate I said what you wanted twice and you're still whining this one coming
(1:37:20) in from strudel Slayer says uh Andrew thanks your kind words St Slater says Andrew I'm a Democrat personally however
(1:37:26) listening to your arguments makes me more Republican when it comes to my daughters how do I find that
(1:37:33) balance uh don't don't find any balance move over to the dark side immediately we need you over here in the worst way
(1:37:40) [ __ ] these Democrat scumbags you can see exactly what they are they're idiots they have no idea what they're talking
(1:37:46) about they will actually put kids on puberty blockers for because even though
(1:37:52) there's inconclusive of Science by their own metrics because it makes them feel better these people are [ __ ] insane
(1:37:59) stop it immediately go over to the conservative side that's where me and
(1:38:05) I'll put it in quotes Nicole are at the moment this one coming in from this is an angry Guy dog like holy
(1:38:12) [ __ ] Richie Constitution I would feel I'd feel a lot better if I had uh the
(1:38:18) problem is is I have such a caloric deficit uh let me let me go take care of that and it'll be happy like you Richie
(1:38:25) Constitution says can I identify as a black female if I really feel like one
(1:38:30) should people treat me like one if I say I am or just female but not black please
(1:38:40) explain I'll read it again so this is for classy or LSP they say can I identify as a black female if I really
(1:38:47) feel like one I'm assuming this is a white guy they say he's a cracker so they say should be the criteria is for
(1:38:54) ident dog I ain't your doctor go see a [ __ ] doctor and ask that question I think that
(1:39:01) uh classy any thoughts they say should people treat me like one if I say I am a black woman or just female but not black
(1:39:08) please let me know why one or the other I don't know a response you got
(1:39:16) it oh it's p one more time bouncing it back to you no response oh I'm sorry I said I ain't
(1:39:22) your doctor dude I don't really if you go like I don't know how to treat you go see a doctor about you being identifying
(1:39:27) As One race you got it like I don't really have much of a response to that it's like
(1:39:33) yeah if his doctor declared him black and he was you know I don't know born in
(1:39:38) Western Europe from a long line of Western Europeans and looked very similar to I don't know me would you say
(1:39:45) his doctor was wrong if what if his doctor said he was
(1:39:51) black is his doctor is that your question he looked exactly like me or Nicole you would say his doctor
(1:39:59) was wrong yeah I would just say transracial like if I don't know what the term is but that would be the term I would adopt it's a transracial person
(1:40:05) but if you're obsessed with a semantic debate is he really black well he identifies as black der I don't know yeah I don't know man I guess it depends
(1:40:12) on how he uh he presents ultimately I'm sorry Jos your doctor tells you you're
(1:40:17) black can you say the n-w yeah you can say the N word go noes oh okay great ni Cole I did not realize
(1:40:25) that you were trying to speak for a long time sorry about that yeah I mean I've been muted for at least half an hour 20
(1:40:30) minutes and I it's just weird because I was probably speaking for maybe 10 to 15% of the total debate time while a
(1:40:37) couple other people probably spoke for 50 to 70% of it so I just think it's kind of weird um I mean I gave up two
(1:40:44) hours of my night to be here and I think I you know articulated some good arguments and so it's just really odd
(1:40:51) that my mic's been muted and I got about 10% of the total time to speak I also
(1:40:56) had multiple points that I wanted to make but other people were given five to 10 times the amount of speaking time so
(1:41:03) I W just to clarify I do want to be clear that that was that was are you
(1:41:08) gonna let me talk yeah please do is that that was not on purpose so I am I do sincerely apologize and we'll give you
(1:41:14) all the time right now because I know you have to go so if you want the next 12 minutes it is all yours cuz I did
(1:41:21) make a mistake there so I am sorry I honestly just didn't notice because for some reason oh you know what it was okay
(1:41:27) earlier in the debate I I muted everybody and I forgot that but yes it
(1:41:34) means that I have to undo it for each of you in order for you to talk again but
(1:41:39) go ahead
(1:41:48) Josh so a lot of the people are trying to especially LSP are trying to
(1:41:54) cavalierly dismiss very good questions and very good arguments that are saying
(1:42:00) hey if we're going to say that confused men magically become women because they think they are then you also must accept
(1:42:08) the fact that confused white people who think they're black are black and are we
(1:42:13) going to accept that absurd conclusion and that absurd reality and he kind of laughs it off and tries to cavalierly
(1:42:21) dismiss it and say I'm not going to have this arent this is stupid the we same analogy was made when it came to the dog
(1:42:28) if a dog you know is constantly called a cat or vice versa and it starts responding to it does the dog magically
(1:42:36) become a cat because of it what all of these questions are trying to get at is kind of the fulcrum of this whole trans
(1:42:43) movement argument which is just because you have an erroneous belief does not
(1:42:48) make that belief true or factual and I
(1:42:53) think it's interesting that instead of answering the questions he just tries to kind of laugh it off and say this is
(1:42:59) crazy he likes to use a lot of curse words I'm not even going to dignify that with a response these are the questions
(1:43:06) that have to be asked when you are taking the side that men can magically
(1:43:12) become women because they are confused the onus is on you to answer those
(1:43:18) questions those are ridiculous questions but because you are arguing that men can
(1:43:24) become women you have to answer them in classy erotic and LSP have demonstrated
(1:43:29) that they can't answer the questions about a transracial man or a trans dog
(1:43:35) or a trans cat and obviously the points that all of the commentators are making and the people watching this and that me
(1:43:42) and Andrew have been making is it's an impossible proposition you're arguing something impossible which is just
(1:43:49) because someone has a diluted belief doesn't make that diluted belief true
(1:43:54) and so I would just encourage them to get better arguments and stop laughing it off I would also argue that it's not
(1:44:00) kind and compassionate to encourage somebody's false beliefs what's kind and
(1:44:06) compassionate is to disabuse them of those beliefs especially when it comes to children now Andrew made a good
(1:44:12) analogy to kids and how impressionable they are with Santa Claus and the Tooth Fairy also what's been demonstrated in
(1:44:20) interrogations is when men who are fely accused of something are given a lot of
(1:44:27) suggestable questions or the questions are loaded by the investigators that can
(1:44:33) elicit a lot of false confessions because even adults are open to suggest
(1:44:39) ability even adults can start believing something that's not true when they are
(1:44:44) lied to or when they are LED a certain way with loaded questions and that's what makes this whole thing so dangerous
(1:44:52) especially as relates to children because if adults can be led astray and adults can be convinced and persuaded of
(1:44:59) something that's vicious e that applies even much more so to little children and
(1:45:06) I think that's why me and Andrew are arguing that even if you don't want them to take hormones or puberty blockers or
(1:45:13) anything and you just want them to be spoken to and you just want medical
(1:45:18) professionals to talk to them that is still dangerous that can still be
(1:45:24) delerious that is still pernicious because of how open to suggestion and
(1:45:30) how malleable not just children but even adults are and so I would argue that
(1:45:36) even talking to kids about this is egregious and reprehensible now he LSP
(1:45:42) also made a lot of points about you're not the parent of my kid LSP that's how me and Andrew feel you are not the
(1:45:49) parent of our kid how dare you in the trans movement try to brainwash them
(1:45:54) into a diluted belief that they can become the opposite sex because they're confused how dare you have Drake Story
(1:46:02) Hour how dare you have them reading books about this stuff you are not the
(1:46:07) parent of our kids that is where we are coming from we want you to keep your
(1:46:13) hands off of our kids and stop feeding them disingenuous stuff and so I would
(1:46:20) argue that if anyone has an argument about keeping your hands off of the kids it's the people who don't want you
(1:46:26) trying to convince our kids of a false belief and getting them to mutilate themselves so keep your [ __ ] hands
(1:46:33) off of our kids that's where we're coming from do you
(1:46:39) understand [ __ ] B can I respond to that or do we gota get to the other question to respond go
(1:46:45) ahead uh dog I don't want to put my hand on your [ __ ] kid it's weird for the Catholics to be talking about putting hands on kids but never mind that your
(1:46:53) whole argument your whole argument your whole argument your whole argument uh this entire time is I'm arguing that
(1:47:00) that men magically become women I ain't arguing that at all dog you are Shadow Boxing a man I don't know they're men
(1:47:06) okay fine they're men they're men they're men okay all I'm arguing is that these people that you want to call men
(1:47:12) for the silly semantic reason they are a trans they are trans people they have a
(1:47:18) certain gender identity that's inong fine you don't want to call them that whatever they gender identity that's in
(1:47:24) congruous with their sex this kind of healthare he it's not your business that's all I'm saying you don't know
(1:47:29) what's in a kid's brain you don't know what's in a kid's brain you think only the kid knows what's in the kid's brain
(1:47:34) I'm not arguing I know what it's in a kid's brain [ __ ] holy [ __ ] stay away from you been strawmanning me all
(1:47:40) [ __ ] day stay away from the kids creepo
(1:47:46) okay I I I just there people who find this entertaining you're you're arguing with a strawman I just thought figured
(1:47:51) somebody would might like to actually have a debate here you're the one trying to proze little kids the onus is on you
(1:47:56) to prove your point you failed miserably at it you got I want to turn all the kids trans I'm about to get your kids I'm gonna turn them off [ __ ] trans
(1:48:03) you got me this one comes in yep fat ass dog says question for LSP and classy
(1:48:10) neurotic uh says if you're comfortable with quote trans women unquote using bathrooms with biological women aren't
(1:48:18) you guys concerned with possible risks like increase in sexual
(1:48:24) assault uh not necessarily because I don't think there's any like data to show that that uh trans women commit
(1:48:30) sexual assault is it inconclusive like the DAT inconclusive
(1:48:37) the data shows they're far more likely to be victims of sexual assault that perpetrators of sexual assault uh if they had examples of like trans women
(1:48:43) actually raping people in bathrooms may be a different story but we really don't have this right and the idea that like
(1:48:48) if you has a law that bans trans from B that's going to stop rapes it seems silly somebody wants to rap woman in the bathroom they're going to go to the
(1:48:54) bathroom to rape a woman um that seems very obvious that's our argument that's our
(1:48:59) argument they're gonna go to the bathroom and do it correct and they might dress up as a
(1:49:05) woman this one coming in from made by Jim Bob says if gender and sex are
(1:49:10) distinct can a female be a transwoman if
(1:49:16) no why not I'm not necessarily sure that gender and sex are distinct they clearly go
(1:49:22) hand in hand in some significant way they overlap gender just TS to be like the more the social the social traits we
(1:49:29) associate with female be a trans woman is a prerequisite of being a trans
(1:49:36) woman hang on hang on I just want to make sure I just want to make sure get the answer whatever whatever answer you
(1:49:41) want whatever answer I want you just gave up whatever answer I want a prerequisite to being a transwoman is
(1:49:48) you have to be a man so no Andrew women can't be trans women cuz a requisite is
(1:49:53) you have to be how [ __ ] dare you sir tell me what a woman can or can't be you're unbelievable you know what why
(1:49:59) don't you you know go make yourself a [ __ ] drink or say get the [ __ ] out of here your transphobia is not acceptable
(1:50:05) on this platform this modern day debate they are that equal opportunity to everybody you ridiculous [ __ ]
(1:50:12) unbelievable it's like I showed up to a pro wrestling match I okay I I know but how do you how do you sell how do you
(1:50:18) show up to something you think is fake and still lose I know this one from fat ass dogs says qu or another question for
(1:50:26) classy and LSP do you guys respect your female relatives if so how would you feel if a biological male competed
(1:50:33) against them in whatever sport they play uh yes I I do have female relatives
(1:50:39) and I might feel odd about it which is why I'm not necessarily against oversight for like how having like a uh
(1:50:46) a trans women compete in women's sports it seems like you could obviously run into some issues with that I'm not against oversight uh what I'm not favor
(1:50:52) of it's like outright bands I think you should probably handle it them more Case by case basis because that seems to be smarter uh not all trans women are like
(1:50:59) built like you know uh like a uh Buck Angel uh you know some of them are are
(1:51:06) built pretty small and slender and look like a woman in every other same like they have the same size so Buck Angel's
(1:51:11) a trans man buddy yeah Angel's a trans man they're not all built like Buck
(1:51:17) Angel is what I said but he's a trans man he's a woman okay yeah he's a bi
(1:51:22) iCal woman he's a trans man you're conflating the two why would they be built okay fine Arnold
(1:51:28) Schwarzenegger okay not all women are B like Arnold Schwarzenegger right some of them are bit are small there you happy
(1:51:34) well I no I'm not happy and I want to jump in James because let's talk about you know brain to phus chemistry the
(1:51:40) endocrine system of men let's talk about male patterns of violence let's talk about the pelvic structure let's talk
(1:51:47) about the muscular structure all of these things are important it doesn't matter what kind of costume you have on
(1:51:54) physiologically you are still a man and those things don't change your pelvis
(1:51:59) isn't changing your wingspan isn't changing your endocrine system isn't changing especially because the
(1:52:06) scientific and medical guidelines say that to be trans and to be valid you don't have to get surgery you don't have
(1:52:13) to take hormones you don't have to even transition or have gender dysphoria to
(1:52:18) be valid so yes we do have a lot of dudes who look like dudes walking around
(1:52:24) claiming their women competing against women so it is a problem okay I didn't deny it was a problem I said I wanted
(1:52:31) government oversight thanks so this one from Jean uh let's see any uh I do know
(1:52:38) that like I said Nicole AKA Josh I want to give you
(1:52:43) uh any last time because I know you have to go on a hard cut off any last thoughts that you did want to share
(1:52:49) before you do have to log off well I'll stick around um I'll Stick Around hey
(1:52:55) thanks for that man you've been a great debate partner this evening I I can't tell you how much I appreciate thanks
(1:53:01) Andrew it's totally okay if you have to go and like I'm sincerely for being uh
(1:53:07) I'm sincerely sorry for being so hard on you earlier tonight well well hang on hang on in James's defense um so so this
(1:53:15) was kind of a bizarre setup that the poor guy had to deal with at one point LSP had to disconnect because of that he
(1:53:22) was trying to keep it fair worth of time from classy that's a really hard position to be in so maybe uh maybe we
(1:53:27) can give him a little bit of slack huh yeah and I'm sorry about my my my uh
(1:53:33) Zoom [ __ ] up yeah I'm hang on hang on I'm asking I'm asking my debate partner
(1:53:38) who was epic this evening maybe maybe we can cut him a little slack Ro yeah I mean I think LP's uh camera identified
(1:53:46) is being on so it's all right we'd have to ask it this one coming from John Michael B
(1:53:54) says so doc gave you male bones at Birth
(1:54:01) got what he's asking did the doctor give you male bones at Birth great question
(1:54:08) great question no I don't think the doctor gives you your bones he might say
(1:54:13) you have the bones of a male but you got it this one coming in from
(1:54:18) Joshua Jamie says not all trans people suffer from gender dysphoria if you're comfortable with your sex and are
(1:54:24) transgender you don't have gender dysphoria yeah so theic the medical
(1:54:32) guidelines make it clear that you don't have to have gender dysphoria and this is the issue that I think me and Andrew
(1:54:38) and a lot of other people have with it right is that the guidelines make it easy for anyone to
(1:54:44) self-identify as trans a lot of trans people do have gender dysphoria but you
(1:54:49) don't have to have it it's not a prerequisite and as I said earlier you also don't have to take hormones don't have to have surgery don't even have to
(1:54:56) transition to be valid all of the medical guidelines uniformally and unequivocally State you just have to
(1:55:03) articulate a gender identity that differs from what they say you're assigned sex at Birth which we all know
(1:55:08) as a euphemism for your sex at Birth it's assigned because that's what you
(1:55:14) are which goes back to the question you just asked which says does the doctor assign your muscle structure does the
(1:55:20) doctor assign your XY chromosomes does the doctor assign your tissue and your
(1:55:27) pelvis like come on you're assigned it because that's what you are but they have to go through these torturous in
(1:55:34) mindbending mental gymnastics for them to argue what they're trying to argue
(1:55:39) and it's kind of sad to watch them play these semantical games and go through these mental and verbal cartwheels just
(1:55:46) to make it all make sense and it's nauseating and I think me and Andrew are getting tired of it because we all know
(1:55:51) what's happening here you're not assigned to sex at Birth you either are a man a woman or a truly inex
(1:56:00) person this coming in from do appreciate your question Joshua Jamie says Josh says invoking interex people is a non
(1:56:08) seiter then invokes eating
(1:56:13) disorders well I think I was arguing that uh I can't remember exactly wait a say yeah this was an internal critique
(1:56:20) so you when he says it's a non seor he's correct when he's doing an internal critique of when somebody else says this
(1:56:27) is a b or c that would be correct actually you the chatter you are making
(1:56:33) the category error he can do an internal critique on somebody else's position it does not affect his position
(1:56:40) dummy they say uh Joshua Jamie also says not all trans people suffer from gender dysphoria if you're comfortable with
(1:56:47) your sex and our transgender you don't have gender dysphoria
(1:56:52) yeah I think you just asked that and I just answered that if I'm not incorrect I'm sorry I'm bitter truth says homo
(1:57:01) isn't uh a uh a preference for one's own sex isn't disease but hypothalamus in
(1:57:08) their brain neurons designed differently due to epigenetic mutations in X
(1:57:14) chromosomes and other factors that completely inconclusive the evidence for
(1:57:19) this is totally inconclusive let me just let me they say that's why hypothalamus smaller
(1:57:25) so please accept them Andrew yeah so this is completely inconclusive and by
(1:57:31) the way this is an old feminist argument feminists used to say you cannot map the brain on because women's Brains are 10%
(1:57:38) smaller and say that they're different from men's Brains now suddenly we're we're trying to uh map these brains as a
(1:57:45) onetoone there is no mapping of what a female brain is total [ __ ] right all
(1:57:51) of the uh brain mapping science is totally not only is it inconclusive but
(1:57:56) every single study that you will see is we need more data we cannot come up with a conclusion from what we have either po
(1:58:03) even postmortem even after they're dead and nobody can argue with their conclusion they still say we cannot come
(1:58:11) up with a conclusion when it comes to scanning brains and I can listen I can
(1:58:17) do this with every single study you have they're all inconclusive every single one of them
(1:58:25) this one coming in from do appreciate it Joshua Jamie says how can we trust Andrew has the most recent research on
(1:58:31) transgender women when he still thinks they are homosexual men against the most
(1:58:37) recent research yeah well what recent research in fact all recent research
(1:58:43) says that affirming care itself can be problematic and we see this in Western Europe uh I can give you multiple
(1:58:50) studies on this but not only that the thing like this has never been in
(1:58:55) dispute that a bunch of dudes with dicks put on wigs and want you to call them women nobody in fact nobody neither of
(1:59:02) our debate Partners have even dis even bothered to try to dispute this they just say that the gender fairy is
(1:59:08) stuffing the wrong soul in the wrong body they're a bunch of materialists they they literally can't even make that
(1:59:14) claim absent conclusive scientific data because they are materialist they can't
(1:59:20) even get into the idea that philosophically there's some sort of like gay Soul or a trans Soul they can't
(1:59:27) even make those claims that's out of their purview right you people are
(1:59:32) [ __ ] insane you want normal people like me normal people like Josh to believe in absolute Insanity it's
(1:59:40) absolute Insanity while at the same time our opponents go oh well you're you're
(1:59:45) mean you're cruel you're an authoritarian [ __ ] I'm not going to let you abuse your children
(1:59:52) especially not on my tax paid dime because that's where it always goes every single time not only do we need gendering care but you need to pay for
(1:59:58) it [ __ ] that now we not going to pay for it but we're going to stop you from doing it you crazy [ __ ] we're
(2:00:05) going to stop it I can I just jump in here too James
(2:00:10) yes there's a a big distinction and I think we need to mention it between
(2:00:16) saying somebody is allowed to have an erroneous belief um we allow people to
(2:00:21) be an mexic and to think they're fat when they're not we allow schizophrenic people to be untreated and think the FBI
(2:00:27) is tailing them these people though don't demand our and our children's
(2:00:33) active participation in their delusions and in their live action role playing so
(2:00:40) anyone's free to believe whatever they want me and Andrew I think I can speak for Andrew you know if you're a dude
(2:00:46) that thinks you're a woman and you're very confused and mentally ill you have a right in America to think that we take
(2:00:53) umbrage at the fact that you want us and our children's active participation in your deluded beliefs
(2:01:01) now no other yeah exactly because otherwise we're gonna kill ourselves right that's the thing right it's like
(2:01:07) it's total emotional hostage taking lie to us or else [ __ ] that [ __ ] no other
(2:01:13) group no other mentally ill group emotionally blackmails people into actively participating in their
(2:01:19) delusions except the transcult which is not satisfied being duded but they need all of us to genuflect at the altar of
(2:01:27) the transcult me and Andrew's position is very simple no we won't and I think
(2:01:32) that's very fair for us to say can I just point out they've been
(2:01:38) saying that like all debate and nobody's been arguing against that yeah you're free to believe whatever you want your
(2:01:44) movement is demanding it so get acquainted with your movement geted with your with me perhaps but if you want to
(2:01:52) like a cardboard cut out of a movement you know get reacquainted with your entire movement you realize you're just staning
(2:01:58) me like do you get I have to repeat myself cuz you're stupid and [ __ ] because you believe men can magically
(2:02:04) become women and we all have to participate I said I have don't believe that several times I don't I'm I'm
(2:02:11) you're just Shadow Boxing of strong man he's not though he's not you I don't believe men can magically become women
(2:02:17) no no no no no but but when you said he stman your position when he's talking about
(2:02:22) the emotional blackmail which comes with airm us or else you actually brought that up during your arguments you said
(2:02:30) because the rates of suicidality increase so that's something we should look at so did your debate partner that
(2:02:35) is emotional hostage taking so don't say you you don't care what we think you very [ __ ] clearly care what we think
(2:02:43) if you didn't you wouldn't be demanding we affirm these people or else they're going to hurt themselves it's emotional
(2:02:48) hostage taking and by the way you are lying what you're Li I don't know how many different times
(2:02:54) I can say it I don't give a [ __ ] if you affirm them okay it ain't your business that's what I've been saying this entire
(2:02:59) debate you can believe whatever you want you don't want to affirm don't [ __ ] affirm them you want to say oh well they can't magically they'll never be women
(2:03:04) they're mentally I don't know [ __ ] that's all why should affirm don't to affir them so we
(2:03:10) shouldn't so we shouldn't out of our I want to affirm them I want out of our school I want to
(2:03:17) make life as healthy as like humanly possible for as many people as possible Right get out of that involves giving
(2:03:22) people access to healthcare and resources they need to better improve their mental health outcomes and all I'm arguing is that people who have these
(2:03:29) kinds of conditions and want to explore options to better themselves should be allowed to do that and all you're doing is Shadow Boxing a strong man saying bit
(2:03:37) dat you're saying you're saying that like oh you just want to didd kids you're saying you all you guys have been
(2:03:44) doing is strong never said anything about diddling kids my kid totally made up yeah that's that's true because tell
(2:03:51) me to your position I'll tell you what though after MDD is done here if you want to come on to the channel or I'll
(2:03:57) come on to yours we can continue the debate One V one I won't I won't straw man
(2:04:04) [ __ ] oh no this one coming in yeah no I didn't think so I didn't [ __ ] think so they always start off with you're
(2:04:12) mistaken it's an isolated incident no we don't want to do this no you guys have it all wrong we simply want to provide a
(2:04:19) safe space for people and then with these people if you give them an inch they take a 100 miles we now know that's
(2:04:26) all a bunch of [ __ ] they don't want to just have a safe space for mentally ill people if they did they wouldn't
(2:04:32) need a movement what they wanted and what they needed a movement for was to
(2:04:37) get into schools get into curriculum demand our active participation in their
(2:04:43) belief system and like a cult if you don't they will try to end you so do not
(2:04:49) believe LSP classy neurotic or any other person that says they're not trying to
(2:04:54) do the most and all they want is a safe space you know that's a lie and the rest of us know it's a
(2:05:00) lie they'll never be satisfied bitter truth says gotta chill I think you you
(2:05:05) to drink some milk bitter truth says classy why same gender brain hypothalamus size smaller
(2:05:12) than others why am I saying that the
(2:05:17) hypothalamus size is smaller than others uh I don't know if I said that um yeah there
(2:05:25) are some differences uh regarding like uh the the brain scans I don't
(2:05:31) understand it's a weird point but are there differences between men and women brains uh they probably is yeah there
(2:05:37) probably is do you think that because women have 10% smaller brains they're not as smart I don't think so I think the uh
(2:05:45) evidence shows that their IQs are are equal like average well not no no no not on the bell curve it doesn't show it on
(2:05:51) the bellur curve it shows in fact that men uh at the at the edges are much
(2:05:57) smarter than women will you acknowledge that that's true that's probably true but I think the UN aage is about the
(2:06:03) same yeah so so so all feminist Doctrine we get to throw it out the window I love that [ __ ] all right this one coming in
(2:06:10) from do appreciate it Joshua Jamie says Andrew doesn't care he's wrong about trans women being homosexual men because
(2:06:18) it's irrelevant yet we'll spend the whole debate talking about trans care which is irrelevant to if trans people
(2:06:26) exist greated so uh let me just kind of uh give this particular commenter his
(2:06:32) doing proper or her doing proper or whatever um the debate prompt was what
(2:06:38) it was we had an early concession we're not going to leave James without a debate and so whatever these guys wanted
(2:06:44) to debate wherever they wanted to go we went there you can't get upset with me
(2:06:49) because I we had an early con session to the debate and I continued to create content for my friend James I don't I
(2:06:56) don't I don't understand what you would be upset about uh we had multiple debates inside of the kind of micro of
(2:07:01) what the debate topic was so G be mad I don't care I have a question that's been
(2:07:07) bugging me this whole time sorry James uh classy how do you know which one of your parents is your father and which
(2:07:12) one's your mother well that's actually interesting I was raised under a single mother so I wouldn't know who my father
(2:07:18) is so yeah how do you know it's your mother uh I mean we can do like some sort of
(2:07:24) genetic test or something like that how did you know your mother is your mother because she assumed the r as my
(2:07:31) mother oh my God you know that's a lie so if your mom assume the roles of
(2:07:38) your father she'd be your father yeah is that what you're saying did she take on the role of your absent father is she a
(2:07:44) man no sense yeah you know sense is a man your mother's a man she took on the
(2:07:50) roles of your would like I would like you to tell that gentleman good day tell that gentleman on behalf of me
(2:07:57) and Josh he was a he was a standup [Laughter] guy this one coming in from do
(2:08:04) appreciate your question Lobster says to the right hypothetically if the science was conclusive that trans care benefited
(2:08:12) everyone who got it would you still be against it nope not at all in fact I I
(2:08:17) would be the first one for it show me the conclusive science in any soci ological Sciences absolutely all all
(2:08:23) affirm all of it as long as it's actually conclusive uh and it's never going to be because this is absurd uh at
(2:08:32) this point by the way in human history what's really funny is that most of us know it's absurd we've been dealing with it for a long time we know it's [ __ ]
(2:08:39) um you'll never be able to get actual conclusive science out of this because all that's going on is you're trying to
(2:08:46) affirm the thing you currently believe which is the opposite of science science is supposed to have have a hypothesis
(2:08:52) which can be falsified that's it you can falsify the hypothesis or not and what's
(2:08:59) Happening Here is the opposite what's going on is they're trying to do science which then affirms their hypothesis
(2:09:06) that's why you're never going to get conclusive science it's all [ __ ] can I ask a question real
(2:09:13) quick Andrew what would it take for you're like it can never be conclusive but then you're like show me the
(2:09:19) conclusive what would it take for something to inclusive for you uh for me there would have to be Mass scientific
(2:09:25) consensus over an elongated period of time which could be demonstrated in the material world um and and wouldn't just
(2:09:31) be philosophical so science really can't negate philosophy it can't negate claims
(2:09:37) like that that's not what it's there to do it's only there to give you a material answer to a material hypothesis
(2:09:45) when you can give me one of those I'm absolutely happy to listen to you I'm I'm I'm thrilled to listen to you there
(2:09:51) is some things by the way if you think I'm bad faith here you're wrong there are many things here which have been
(2:09:56) presented to me on from the trans radical movement from a scientific basis
(2:10:02) that I've been willing to look at happily I'm willing to to admit that I'm wrong I I think that science can provide
(2:10:09) us a lot of material answers I just think that you guys most certainly can't and the inconclusive science at at this
(2:10:16) point which is a sociological one which suffers from a replication crisis and
(2:10:22) then two you have this Paramount problem that it is The Advocates of transgenderism itself which fund a lot
(2:10:29) of these studies they are TR uh truly just trying to affirm their bias this is
(2:10:35) a problem inside of social sciences it has been for a long time both of you guys by the way you know this you can
(2:10:41) look up the replication crisis you know this for sure well it's a problem biom medical research as well yeah yeah and
(2:10:47) medical research as well but this is but what's the second appeal the second appeal is to have medical researchers
(2:10:54) change definitions things like this it is a problem in the medical field and in sociology those are the uh major fields
(2:11:02) in which replic the replication crisis affects soft Sciences it's a big problem
(2:11:07) and one that is it it almost seems as insurmountable because most of it is
(2:11:13) politically based now psychology sociology Medical Science we we're not
(2:11:20) really looking at just falsifying or confirming a hypothesis through a experiment that we can produce over and
(2:11:26) over again now what we're doing is we we'll go we'll go get a new control group if we need to to affirm our own
(2:11:33) bias okay Andrew let's like commit to all that being true what would you suggest how would you suggest we treat
(2:11:39) trans people then uh well so the thing is is that you
(2:11:45) and I have a distinct delineation here I don't think that is good to affirm the
(2:11:51) delusions of somebody who says they're the queen of France I would just tell them that they're not and that they're
(2:11:56) wrong and even at gunpoint meaning they put the proverbial gun to their head and said if you affirm it uh if you don't
(2:12:03) affirm it I will un alive myself and that seems like a self-correcting problem okay I don't feel like you
(2:12:10) really answered my question my question actually I did I did I did so so here I
(2:12:15) I think with I think with what you consider to be trans people uh that we should treat them like would any other
(2:12:22) person who demands that you lie to them to affirm their delusion and not do that that's what I think okay when you say
(2:12:28) it's a self-correcting problem is it a good thing that trans people kill themselves no I didn't say it's good I said self-correcting do you understand a
(2:12:35) problem we should fix yes I think I think that we should mitigate if we can
(2:12:40) uh trans people harming themselves yes but it can't be at the expense of you
(2:12:46) harming us sure okay then how do we prevent them from harming themselves
(2:12:51) you put them in institutions and treat them like we used to with mentally ill people instead you've recategorized this
(2:12:57) as a a non institutionalizing mental illness which is not a good idea okay so
(2:13:04) you want to take trans people and put them into institutions yes that they can get proper treatment just like we would
(2:13:09) any other delusional person okay what is that treatment in the institution we blocked all the trans people in institutions now yeah so it would it
(2:13:15) would vary but you would look at this like those people who want to cut their limbs off they often want to cut their own limbs off for for the purpose of
(2:13:22) affirming that they should only have you know one arm or one leg or whatever it is you do everything in your power for
(2:13:30) years to convince them out of that to try various drugs in order to treat that
(2:13:35) you do everything that you can do to stop them from cutting off the limb okay I'm still lost how do you get
(2:13:42) treat trans people exactly in the institution that this I I just explained it to you I'm not any other mentally ill
(2:13:49) person if you're asking you give this medicine you give this okay so you're asking so
(2:13:56) here let me uh let me fire back if I was going to replace a circuit breaker in a
(2:14:01) house what type of circuit breaker would you recommend I used I don't know yeah you don't know
(2:14:08) but you do know you need a circuit breaker so the thing is is like you don't have to know what the specifics of
(2:14:13) the treatment are that's not relevant you do know that these people need treatment that is relevant sure your
(2:14:21) case in your case you say yes I agree with you Andrew they need treatment right but I can't give you any sort of
(2:14:29) conclusive data on what type of treatment they need and it's like okay that's fair enough you can't give me any
(2:14:35) conclusive data and I can't back but we know these people are [ __ ] up we can at least agree on
(2:14:41) that okay taken all these trans people you've taken all these trans people you put them in an institution right if the
(2:14:48) doctors are like okay we got to treat these people with g gender affirming care are you against that if I if the
(2:14:56) doctors themselves so there could be a case and isolate a case for instance where somebody said they were the queen
(2:15:01) of France and the doctors know it's not true but for some reason inside the mental Asylum they decided that that
(2:15:08) would be a good treatment course there's a distinction between that and me even granting that that could be and you
(2:15:15) demanding that people on the street also treat them as the queen of France that's the iction and so the answer to you
(2:15:23) would be if you really wanted to expand freedom and you really wanted to expand sovereignty then you would not demand
(2:15:29) that Christians lie okay I'm gonna ask my question again
(2:15:35) I just answered it in the you didn't you went on some rant about what you you well you stman me again I'll make it Hy
(2:15:42) specific whatever your question is I'll make it hypers specific the answer go ahead okay my question was you put them
(2:15:49) in in an institution a doctor says these trans people who are You' just institutionalized they need to be
(2:15:56) transitioned with gender affirming care yeah stop that yeah yeah in the hospital
(2:16:01) perhaps not in the public yes is that is that simple enough yeah sure thanks okay
(2:16:07) hang on hang on hang on did I answer that specifically enough for you yes this time it's specific enough I
(2:16:13) appreciate that okay even though I said the exact same thing I just want to let you know I said the same thing I just gave you the reasoning behind the thing
(2:16:19) that I just said that's all I just want to tell you what we don't do and as sensible rational adults
(2:16:27) something we should all agree on what we don't do is we don't demand active
(2:16:33) participation of adults and children in mentally ill people's delusions we don't
(2:16:39) demand that people lie and affirm these people's delusions we don't allow
(2:16:45) mentally ill men into women's spaces can I can I actually give an example here like okay let's say I was dating one of
(2:16:52) Josh's daughters and I and I and I called him up and I said either your
(2:16:58) daughter keeps dating me or I'm gonna blow my brains out what would you recommend LSB okay first what is he like 30 answer
(2:17:06) my answer my question bro what would I confirm dude blow your brains out please yeah right exactly because it's a
(2:17:12) self-correcting problem right yeah corrected yeah exactly exactly exactly thank you thank you thank you you're
(2:17:18) welcome you're welcome buddy again we can't it's okay for you to be mentally
(2:17:23) ill it's okay for people to go untreated with their mental illness me and Andrew just don't think you should be allowed
(2:17:31) to forcibly demand our participation in your delusions and that our wives and
(2:17:38) daughters need to be sacrificial Lambs for mentally ill men that is Peak male
(2:17:43) hegemony that is Peak misogyny and I think most people can agree it's ridiculous if you have an erroneous in
(2:17:51) diluted belief that's fine you need to deal with it in therapy or in a
(2:17:56) psychiatric institution or in some kind of setting that does not demand our
(2:18:01) wives and children's active participation we are sick and tired of it it's a zero some game when you force
(2:18:09) us to play that game of I'm gonna un alive myself if your wife doesn't let me into her Sports League or your wife
(2:18:16) doesn't let me into her bathroom stop with the emotional blackmail stop with the in our participation and start
(2:18:22) treating these people in a psychiatric setting I don't need to detail delineate it or adbr it for you all I know is it
(2:18:30) needs to be dealt with in a psychiatric setting like any other false and deluded belief but but but I am I am okay with
(2:18:37) them kicking the [ __ ] out of the women's leagues I'm not gonna lie Josh like I'm fine with it they voted for it Josh let them deal with it Josh let them deal
(2:18:43) with there's a question about the psychiatric setting like how much do you think it would cost taxpayers to I don't give a [ __ ] it doesn't matter stop
(2:18:50) invading women's Reserve spaces and stop brainwashing our kids I don't give a [ __ ] what it costs oh okay sure well
(2:18:59) well I mean to answer your okay sure I can answer your question directly okay sure yeah I can lexicon
(2:19:07) elevate your nomenclature do a better job when you're debating you're a poor interloc one LP you uh okay sure sorry
(2:19:18) yeah Joshua Jamie says Andrew thinks all trans people believe they are quote born
(2:19:23) in the wrong body unquote shows that Andrew fundamentally can't comprehend
(2:19:28) what trans people even are what a PE brain yeah I mean look at the lies
(2:19:34) though from the chatter right actually what my position was if the chatter wasn't so [ __ ] stupid they would know
(2:19:40) that from a materialist point of view that's a materialist point of view you only
(2:19:46) believe in the material there is no spiritual saying that a person can have a reference to what a woman is when
(2:19:52) they're not one you have a reference to what a female is if they're not one would be an some type of uh argument
(2:19:59) towards the soul of the person that's why they try to do all this brain scan mapping dummy they try to do it so that
(2:20:05) they can affirm their position because otherwise they're going to have to get into spiritual aspects they're literally
(2:20:11) philosophically going to have to get into spiritual aspects they've lost that debate so they're trying to find any sort of physical data and they can't
(2:20:18) they can't do it they can't that that's why I'm saying from a materialist position they cannot say that the soul
(2:20:25) Fair stuff the wrong soul and the wrong body right they would have to instead bite the bullet and say h actually
(2:20:31) you're right um from a materialist position if they have gender dysphoria
(2:20:36) that actually should be correct so why why even bother affirming like it makes no sense why even bother affirming it
(2:20:43) and from a utilitarian perspective what the trans movement is advocating is not working women are actively being harmed
(2:20:50) children are actively being harmed both by asking for their forced participation and grooming them and having them
(2:20:56) mutilate themselves so from a utilitarian perspective it's just not working the way it is this mental
(2:21:03) illness needs to be dealt with like any other mental illness in a psychiatric setting stop emotionally blackmailing us
(2:21:09) stop demanding our participation stop invading women's
(2:21:15) spaces I I'll I'll reaffirm though that I don't give a [ __ ] about women spaces but anyway
(2:21:20) there's two sets there's two sets here trans exclusionary radical feminists or turfs who have been given that moniker
(2:21:27) that slur by men bro they vote for it bro who are trans identified come on
(2:21:32) answer to this they vote for it if it was just you voting and Men voting this [ __ ] would be done with it would be over
(2:21:39) with these women vote the [ __ ] in let them deal with the consequences because because that's why we got Trump we get
(2:21:45) Trump we get Trump and guys like Trump and conservatives overwhelmingly winning because women finally have to deal with
(2:21:52) the product of their own vote don't don't give them an out make them get their brain bashed in let them get their
(2:21:58) asses kicked make them deal with the product of their own vote bro liberal feminists voted for this they've taken
(2:22:04) the sight of the trans activist and the gender ideologists but trans exclusionary radical feminists which are
(2:22:10) just feminists that acknowledge sex they're still monsters they're still monsters bro don't agree with it and they're fighting hard against it yeah
(2:22:16) [ __ ] them they're monsters just like the they're as monstrous as the as as the [ __ ] trans radicals themselves the
(2:22:22) trans radical feminist feminists are yes they're just as monstrous let them deal with it these were the same people who
(2:22:29) absolutely [ __ ] demanded this and then when they got it they went oh my God they're going the women space and do
(2:22:36) make him deal with it make him deal with it don't save him don't be Captain Sho make him deal with it bro make him deal
(2:22:42) with it I like the turfs I and I identify as a Turf because I'm a woman
(2:22:47) so I can be a Turf and you have to respect it bigot that was for classy LSP or classy
(2:22:55) any thoughts no I have no thoughts to that yeah
(2:23:00) figures this this coming in from rude mud Crabb says self identity is
(2:23:07) stupidity identification is the tool of the Observer you are what you are
(2:23:12) perceived to be not what you imagine yourself to be well James we all have
(2:23:18) agency and autonomy so one's free to self-identify however they want and me and Andrew are welcome to say that's a
(2:23:25) bunch of [ __ ] so no one's saying you can't self-identify however you want but guess what agency is a two-way street
(2:23:32) autonomy is a two-way street even though you have the right to identify however you want we have a right to reject it
(2:23:39) and acknowledge sex-based realities and differences so you have to respect our
(2:23:45) views if you want us to respect yours and the way this works is you can feel however you want but we're allowed to
(2:23:51) feel however we want and we want you to stay the [ __ ] away from women and
(2:23:56) children yeah I don't disagree with any of that it's agree toe disagree like dog you want to have your views God bless
(2:24:02) you like I I'm just saying like don't interfere with My Views don't interfere with the views of my family don't interf
(2:24:08) with view our doct forcing it we're not forcing it on to you you're
(2:24:14) forcing it you're forcing healthare bands on to trans people our participation in you are forcing healthare bands on to trans people
(2:24:21) yeah yeah I know we P you to feed your kids too we're [ __ ] monsters we're
(2:24:27) [ __ ] monsters hey don't mutilate your kid hey
(2:24:32) keep your hands off my kid I'll mutilate him if I want to bigot LSP I want to give you the last wait wait you guys
(2:24:38) against circumcision by the way are you guys against
(2:24:43) circumcision actually this actually this would actually this would make my point for me yes I'm circumcised and the thing
(2:24:50) is is that that was a form of Mutilation which was uh put into the ethos and
(2:24:56) there was all sorts of bad science behind it which said that if you had such a circumcision it would be healthy
(2:25:01) for you this was brought in by a bad Dogma with bad science and absolutely I
(2:25:07) would not recommend that young men having families circumcise their children I don't think it's a good idea
(2:25:14) because that happened to me when I was an infant are you blaming me the victim what did I do except exist what did I do what did I
(2:25:22) do to deserve that bro what did I do there's bad science and bad doctors I never no [ __ ] that's crazy wow oh my god
(2:25:30) oh what so I guess that's uh yes y'all are against circumcision yes yes I I think I'm
(2:25:37) against circumcision absolutely I think that it's a form of General mutilation the church the church itself the
(2:25:43) Orthodox Church itself has said it's fine to not have your children circumcised and so has the C the
(2:25:48) Catholic church has come out and said this as well we had a lot of bad science with a lot of bad Dogma for a long time right by
(2:25:54) the way the Orthodox church has stayed true to that for a long time sense oh I don't know Jesus Christ time but the
(2:26:00) point is is that again because this happened this heinous horrible genital
(2:26:06) mutilation happened to me why is it not okay for me to speak out about why that's not okay to do to other people
(2:26:11) you're not allowed I'm sorry to uh you know mutilate a child's
(2:26:16) genitals whether that happened to me and my parents had the best of intention for that it doesn't
(2:26:22) matter don't compare or analogize triming off a piece of for
(2:26:28) skin to chopping off a [ __ ] or chopping off breasts please don't make that
(2:26:33) analogy it's a very poor argument I think the question give the last word LSP on that question because
(2:26:41) it was originally addressed to you well I'm sorry what was the question again if you have any last word that
(2:26:48) you'd like to give I mean I guess I can read it no I'm sorry I didn't hear what the question was can you repeat the
(2:26:54) question I was mean meaning more like in terms of responding to what Andrew and Josh just said if you want me to go all
(2:26:59) the way back to the start of the question oh no no no I'm sorry I thought you said yeah no you can go my bad Jake
(2:27:06) L says does your Coke identify as a Coke Zero it is Coke Zero I think this is
(2:27:13) some sort of joke raw dogs I thought he said does your cult identify as a cult I'm actually curious does your trans
(2:27:19) cult identif as a cult yeah sure whatever yeah okay just
(2:27:27) yeah those Cults don't but I was just curious also will you affirm my God again I kind of missed that part God's
(2:27:33) amazing my God yep your God's amazing I demand your affirmation will you give it
(2:27:39) yeah there go I'll kill myself if you don't I'll kill myself all right right
(2:27:46) right got to got to conform to the YouTube to here I'll kill myself who walk this is a great mix by the way
(2:27:52) don't talk about undoing yourself St this one from raw dog says women in
(2:27:59) women in menopause don't get estrogen anymore because it causes cancers so giving to boys and men is
(2:28:07) good yeah I mean it can be uh so there's men who have testicular cancer for instance and uh often they'll use
(2:28:15) estrogen treatments and those can be very good for them and it can cause all sorts of side effects medical side
(2:28:20) effects so yeah there there can definitely be a cause to increase estrogen in men um and all sorts of
(2:28:29) medical procedures and interventions depending on what's going on with the physiology of the human
(2:28:36) body yeah if I can like tap on to that there are conditions where we do give
(2:28:42) people like estrogen or testosterone that are unrelated to being trans like I autog chasa or the I'm sorry chasa when
(2:28:50) men developed hits or certain Androgen disorders though sometimes sometimes that actually happens because of the
(2:28:55) upping of estrogen yeah just depends just depends on the condition but I mean
(2:29:00) I largely agree with you on this yeah that's what I'm saying there are legitimate Health Care needs for this
(2:29:05) even if it might conceivably cause cancer I haven't seen that that sounds plausible I'll take your word for it but
(2:29:11) even it might conceivably cause cancer there there might be other Healthcare needs that legitimizes it um what I
(2:29:17) would be curious of is would you guys well would you would you stop like me from giving my my son who's developed
(2:29:23) breasts uh uh testosterone or or the an androgen
(2:29:28) blocker whatever it is they that would be so so in this case you would be attacking the uh typified pathway of
(2:29:35) development uh so so all you're trying to do to me it would be the same as if
(2:29:40) your son was a horrific burn victim and you you did skin grafting neither myself nor Josh would be against that of course
(2:29:48) not that's not an interference with the typified pathway instead that's you trying to correct something which
(2:29:54) interjected into it that makes sense so the the opposition if I can the
(2:30:02) opposition if I'm understanding you correctly to trans affirming care is that it makes somebody the untyped
(2:30:07) gender related to that sex yeah so the well so whether you believe this or not
(2:30:14) um you can go down you know any number of different ways you can say well there's some men who don't produce small gametes or sperms so are they still men
(2:30:21) or there's some men who don't have uh XY chromosomes are they still men this and that but there's really only two
(2:30:28) Pathways for development that human beings can go down it's either male or female and that's it like it or not
(2:30:33) there's only two and there's only ever going to be two even chimeras only have two so hang on hang on let me finish so
(2:30:41) the the idea here being we know the pathway the person's supposed to develop along we know this from their physiology
(2:30:48) every person essentially has these two options so if this is the case if there's some type of contagion or
(2:30:55) something like this like let's say there was something that uh I I don't know only sterilized males and you were to
(2:31:01) give them a drug to stop that I think that that's perfectly acceptable yeah I guess when I hear your
(2:31:07) position it seems like I'd rather you be normal you know even if you're miserable um like I value that above hang on hang
(2:31:14) on that's not that's not actually my position hang on I'll just correct it real quick well you're talking about them being typified but can
(2:31:20) but I'll correct it real quick that that that that's actually not my position real quick very quickly no what I'm
(2:31:26) saying is that you can't conclusively demonstrate that they're going to be miserable or not miserable due to your
(2:31:33) care that's my problem okay I can't conclusively demonstrate that but there is a very
(2:31:39) real possibility they will be better right there very real possibility to the
(2:31:45) opposite the overwhelming consensus by medical associations that is not the am
(2:31:51) Association the AMA is not the ultimate Pediatric Society they're not the ultimate Arbiter on this this is a
(2:31:58) global phenomenon which is being competed between so who would be the many oh my God there's so many different
(2:32:06) localized medical associations who have studied this for you to say that the AMA
(2:32:11) is why would the AMA take precedent by the way tell me that because it's one of the most well respected medical organizations in it's not it's one of
(2:32:18) the least respected the came about as a doctors and medical profession yes let
(2:32:23) me explain to you because you may not know the history of the AMA the AMA came about as a unionization of doctors
(2:32:29) weren't getting paid enough and they actually went after uh medicine which
(2:32:34) was non-westernized in order to discredit it so that doctors would get a pay increase this is all public
(2:32:40) knowledge if you don't believe me go look at go look at it for yourself no the a like I said hang on I'm telling
(2:32:46) you the AMA is not looked at as a global Authority at all all at all by any
(2:32:52) nobody sees the AMA as being some Authority on [ __ ] anything this was a
(2:32:58) unionization effort which destroyed Eastern medicine homeopathic medicine
(2:33:04) anything which was not the confined standard of Western medicine I'm telling you look at the history of the AMA
(2:33:10) you're going to apologize to me I promise yeah I don't I'm sure anorexic people would be heartbroken and
(2:33:16) distressed if they couldn't keep losing weight and I'm sure love to take diet pills and get lipos suction that's not a
(2:33:22) good argument for us to give anorexic people lipos suction in diet pills so I really don't give a [ __ ] if they're
(2:33:28) distressed that's not a good argument for confusing them further and helping
(2:33:34) them believe the deluded belief that they are the opposite sex I don't give a
(2:33:39) [ __ ] if they're distressed about it distressed about things what would you suggest we do then this healthare makes
(2:33:47) us feel better you're saying demand anything that does not demand me my wife
(2:33:52) or my children's active participation well in in this case in this case Okay gendering care does not require your
(2:33:58) active participation you don't have to do it does not
(2:34:03) noing we're not compromise hang on hang on hang on then let's compromise let's compromise inside of the public school
(2:34:11) system where I send my son if you send your son who you decide and your doctors
(2:34:17) decide is a female is that school going to require my son to use the gender
(2:34:24) pronouns which you think are appropriate for yours no no the school might just tell
(2:34:30) your son to [ __ ] off and leave the kid alone can you answer my question honestly I have no idea it's what do you
(2:34:36) I mean what do you think what do you think what do you think the trans Community is going to push for well obviously they're going to push for you
(2:34:42) you to be inclusive like you are going to prove to be not [ __ ] I'll tell you what I'll tell you what I'll make a deal with you
(2:34:50) his transition I'll make a deal with transition doesn't invol you I'll make a deal with you if you can if you can
(2:34:56) promise that no child of mine will ever have to or be demanded towards me the
(2:35:03) parent or the child to affirm this person's pronouns inside of a public
(2:35:09) setting where you're legally required to send your [ __ ] kid then sure get it give it to me in a law and then I don't
(2:35:15) give a [ __ ] chop your [ __ ] kid's dick off nobody [ __ ] cares agree I no you have the First Amendment you
(2:35:21) don't have to affirm [ __ ] I don't have any other wayse I can say yeah unless you unless you're in a public school you give up your first amendment rights as a
(2:35:28) child you don't have them the school becomes your custodian if that's the case they can make you do all sorts of
(2:35:34) things which are not in hang on which you're not in compliance can you guarantee me can you write into law can
(2:35:40) you codify into law that yes I cut my kids's dick off but your kid never has to affirm it in a setting where they're
(2:35:46) legally bound to go which is public school why you willing to make that compromise or [ __ ]
(2:35:52) not that you don't have to affirm my kid yeah I'll make that compromise and my kids won't have to in a public school
(2:35:57) setting where they're legally obligated to go off exactly hey let me talk let me talk shut
(2:36:04) up let me talk please that's what I thought you don't have to affirm anything your kids don't have you keep saying that's right I agree with you you
(2:36:10) don't have to affirm [ __ ] I don't mean the times I can say it can we burn in school if we're in a school and you
(2:36:17) don't want to address my [ __ ] son by preferred prown go my [ __ ] son and the schools they can make you stay apart
(2:36:24) from each other because there's a bullying situation if you're just going to bully my [ __ ] kid I don't want you going near my kid I don't care about
(2:36:30) your the buling is only going one way hang on great if you will if you will
(2:36:35) adopt legislation which creates a segregated a segregated school system
(2:36:41) where your trans kid gets removed from my kid because my kid can't be compelled to affirm their care show me that
(2:36:47) legislation I'll [ __ ] I'll support my Congressman to sign it tomorrow and we will put your [ __ ] kid in some trans
(2:36:55) classroom and they can confirm each other all [ __ ] day and nobody else has to deal with it I don't give a [ __ ]
(2:37:00) the white gu love it no I love it that's that's that that goes to our position know you're in love with segregation

(2:37:59) or the LGBT alphabet Mafia Cults bullying other people into joining the
(2:38:05) cult and so when you look at higher and lower education especially the bullying is really the cult trying to bully
(2:38:12) people to join the cult and when we don't want to join the cult we get called the bullies so I actually don't
(2:38:18) even understand anyway don't I don't actually understand the position maybe he can help me out LSP why would you say that I'm insane if
(2:38:25) if you and I say if your kid has some gender affirming care treatment from
(2:38:31) some medical professionals because you think it's good for your kid and I say okay I'm not going to interfere with
(2:38:37) that however if they're both in a public school setting my beliefs need to be respected and if my kid does not want to
(2:38:44) affirm the lie that at least we perceive as a family is a lie
(2:38:50) that they don't have to if we're willing to compromise on that and you're willing to draft or have your politicians draft
(2:38:56) legislation for that what what is it what what is your actual problem here with my position honestly okay I don't
(2:39:03) have a problem with that position ain't your position that's insane it's your hate motivated justification for just
(2:39:10) being addicted people like I have the right to be a dick so the justification the justification is uh I'm just nice
(2:39:17) and you're not uh but we agree great [ __ ] argument [ __ ] he's mad that
(2:39:24) you won't allow the forced and compelled participation of your child in his child's delusions that's what he's mad
(2:39:30) about he's going to bully you into joining the cult and he wants to bully your child into no well actually it's just T policing he's just upset because
(2:39:38) he came to the same conclusion that I did but he's nice and I'm not that's it that's that's between and and at the top
(2:39:46) of this when I said this was ultimately debate about Freedom versus control my thing has consistently been do whatever
(2:39:51) you want and this guy's consistently been let me bully the [ __ ] out of you and control what you how is it bullying if you agree with me how could it be
(2:39:57) bullying not not affirming people can be a form of bullying oh okay well then
(2:40:02) what and what's your answer to that the same as mine that if we have conflicting beliefs we segregate away from each other right yeah schools should separate
(2:40:09) people then what is the problem here we came to the same exact conclusion sh that you're mad that I wasn't nice
(2:40:15) you're just mad that I wasn't nice you want that you want it you don't make segregated schools to get away from
(2:40:21) bullying dog I don't know that's what you want segregated schools okay so then you
(2:40:28) want my Christian Child to be compelled to use pronouns they think is a lie
(2:40:33) right just don't talk to my kid in school how hard is it tell your kid yeah okay okay great they they don't have to
(2:40:39) talk to each other but what if right what if they they have some situation where it's like a group or class project
(2:40:46) that the teacher has and this kid refuses to use the pronouns are they wrong no it was on the teacher to like
(2:40:53) make sure those kids aren't in the same right so you're just advocating for a form of segregation dummy how stupid [ __ ] are how dumb
(2:41:00) are you you're advocating forting in the classroom
(2:41:05) like your whole idea is segregation to you yeah your whole idea is this your whole idea is keep them away from each
(2:41:11) other so they have your whole your whole your whole argument here is keep them away from each other if they come into
(2:41:18) contact with each other there's going to be problem so keep them away from each other that's what we like to call in the real world segregation so what you want
(2:41:25) to do is keep them as far apart as possible because our ideologies don't mix great I say the same exact thing and
(2:41:31) you're like but that's equal it's the same [ __ ] position dummy I in the
(2:41:36) classroom is not segregation Clearly say segregation we talking about building take a deep breath I do want to give you
(2:41:43) the last word so I do need you Andrew and Josh because the Super Chat was a
(2:41:48) challenge to them or namely LSP and classy I want to give them the last word and we gotta go to the next question
(2:41:55) honestly I don't remember what the Super Chat was again Le carry on for a bit I think it
(2:42:00) was oh no way it was estrogen it was like uh estrogen cancer have a a
(2:42:05) response to what they just said I mean like it doesn't have to be you already did respond presumably to the Super Chat
(2:42:11) earlier but if you want to respond to it again what I'm usually I'm usually I
(2:42:17) don't to sentence sorry I'm sorry one other P so
(2:42:25) if you want to say anything to what they most recently said here's a chance otherwise I'm go to the next question oh
(2:42:31) no by all means go to the next question Trump Andor says Andrew respect people's feelings you savage LOL Dr w11 says can
(2:42:38) I identify as 65 years old and start getting Social Security
(2:42:44) LSP yeah knock yourself out
(2:42:49) why not why not why can't he and actually I want he totally can yeah I
(2:42:54) want to keep the kids together and I'm going to compel your child's active participation in affirming all of my
(2:43:01) child's beliefs you got to affirm my child's God I want you to affirm my all of my child's false beliefs about
(2:43:08) himself would you be okay with that I agree there is no God but Muhammad and the and Muhammad as the prophet would
(2:43:14) you be okay with that I don't piss be upon him piss be upon him
(2:43:19) you wouldn't be you wouldn't be okay with that and we're not okay with you doing the same thing to us and our kids hope I wouldn't be okay with it I
(2:43:27) understand ccha let's see classy would you also say
(2:43:32) that like if I said hey I'd like to you know I'm
(2:43:37) 65 I want Social Security Now from the government like are you cool with that I
(2:43:43) would just like I would just like say that like there's a difference between age and gender where linear it only goes
(2:43:50) in like One Direction and gender is a qualitative uh assessment so one is quantitative one is uh more
(2:44:02) qualitative Josh any thoughts anybody any thoughts well he's lying and whenever someone brings up the
(2:44:08) transracial argument or the transabled argument with which Andrew alluded to earlier or any other argument trans
(2:44:16) species argument whatever they always say oh well that's different well I
(2:44:21) would argue that being transracial is actually a lot more likely and a lot more probable and believable than being
(2:44:28) transgender our race is a lot more fluid nebulous and amorphous than our Sexes
(2:44:36) and so if you are accepting the proposition that people can change their
(2:44:41) sex which a lot of the literature now says sex is fluid and they're arguing
(2:44:46) that actually gender Trump's sex so it doesn't even matter if you're going to take that position you have to say that
(2:44:55) people can be transracial and that is a lot more believable and strains credulity a lot less than being
(2:45:02) transgender but they can never have an answer to it they just come with that stock reply that oh well that's
(2:45:08) different how there is no difference other than it's a lot more believable to be
(2:45:16) transracial any thoughts LP classy I have no thoughts I figured you don't
(2:45:24) true you have to have an empty brain to believe what you believe true my brain is that
(2:45:29) empty this this debate has gotten to a unique place I don't see this very often
(2:45:35) but this one from hot doging it says LSP so if doctors tell you to beat your
(2:45:41) children would you our doctors your sense of morality or just authority Andrew you're amazing Jesus Christ is
(2:45:48) Lord doctors are where I go to get health care advice for people who are sick or have some sort of
(2:45:55) condition like no I wouldn't beat my kid because my doctor says beat your [ __ ] kid right would you mutilate your kid
(2:46:00) what well what if what if that was the consensus of the time uh no I wouldn't beat my kid you
(2:46:07) wouldn't beat your kid right so even if well even if they're well beat beat is
(2:46:12) fine but so even if there was a consensus in the medical literature which conflicted with your moral beliefs
(2:46:18) you still wouldn't do it that seems fair to me yeah I'm not saying you have to transition your kid you don't it's your
(2:46:25) kid yeah stop teaching it in the schools stop teaching it in the curriculum stop demanding our active participation in it
(2:46:31) stop invading women's spaces we are making the same argument you're making you're actually making stop telling them not to invade women's faes that's the
(2:46:38) best thing they do stop it you're making Andrew's argument for us and you're actually capitulating and and positing
(2:46:45) that it's not okay to force people to engage in something that they think is
(2:46:50) morally repugnant and morally noxious and that is all we're saying is we don't want to participate in your diluted game
(2:46:57) anymore okay youve said that a lot and I've agreed the entire time thanks well then get out of our children's schools
(2:47:03) our children's books and our children's shows in our children's M be all right
(2:47:08) I'm getting out I'm getting out sorry I'm getting out well tell your buddies because they're not getting the m i got them on the phone right now guys get out
(2:47:13) all right you should weirdo it's your cult not mine
(2:47:19) this one coming in from he's got him on the phone right now he's he's got a
(2:47:24) sense of urgency glitch says they want to delay puberty to keep a childlike mindset children can't differentiate
(2:47:32) fact from fiction it makes them susceptible to their
(2:47:38) fantasies agree uh who I mean no I think children can differentiate fact from
(2:47:44) fiction they might be persuadable but like at some point I don't remember who it was like out your 10 you still believing in Santa Claus you get still
(2:47:49) conf a 10 dude ain't I don't know 10-year-old believe in Santa Claus you have a really dumb 10y oldold to believe in Santa Claus feel like most children
(2:47:55) figure that out by like six or seven yeah we have 60-year-old men self-identifying as women in entering
(2:48:01) women's Reserve spaces kind of [ __ ] weird don't you think yeah anyway transitioning it's not
(2:48:07) like oh you're six let's go get your dick cut off it's it's it's a yearslong process involving multiple visits to
(2:48:13) doctors and therapists and consultations with your child in conjunction with that like how do you feel when makes you feel
(2:48:19) better it's it's a whole process so I don't know how to respond to it what do you say to women who say why are men
(2:48:25) mansplaining to us what it is to be a woman what do you say to those women
(2:48:30) what do I say to women who are asking why men mansplain what it is to be a woman yes [ __ ] I don't know I don't
(2:48:36) know why all right I figured you're pretty [ __ ] stupid you got me
(2:48:42) I'm it's just become blood Sports uh let's see they've got to stick up their ass they've had a stick up their ass

(2:50:14) with to say well really the issue is that the data is not conclusive well really you think men can
(2:50:20) become I'm happy I'm so happy to contend with this I will literally write your argument out as you make it and contend
(2:50:26) with it so it's not strongand I'll actually have you agree your own AR five times before you gave like a direct
(2:50:31) answer earlier no I feel like never happened in fact in fact I'll even I'll
(2:50:37) even I I always even reiterated as I gave the descriptor for why my position
(2:50:42) was what it was and you said you're not answering directly enough I would even be charitable enough to say well let me

(2:51:29) than me okay it's a Basse tattoo okay it was and you got me the good Subway s i i

(2:51:42) but I'll tell you Andrew when we met wanted his jalapeno meatball sandwich
(2:51:49) and I said Andrew you're pretty sick why do you want that kind of Subway sandwich he said trust me James it's great and it

(2:52:09) mayonnaise I know that it sounds sick but if you guys try it you're never going to regret it just
(2:52:14) saying you're funny I uh you said Mayo with

(2:52:26) uh that that flavor home I'm saying you know little bit hang onang I'll tell you
(2:52:32) what I'll tell you what you go here's the recipe James one more time okay here's the I'm gonna make the $200 bet
(2:52:38) $200 bet if this isn't the best Subway sandwich you ever had you get the red
(2:52:44) onion the Tomato the meatball uh and then you do the jalapeno
(2:52:49) with a little bit of mayonnaise you're going to love that sandwich if I'm wrong I'll send in a $200 Super Chat my word
(2:52:56) on it you said okay meatball okay I'll try it no joke I'll try it try it if I'm
(2:53:02) wrong if I'm wrong if you don't actually this is really good in all seriousness though I do have a question I want to
(2:53:09) apologize because I did not ask you this at the beginning and I can't tell are you a man or a woman I'm definitely a
(2:53:16) man a tremendous man okay tremendous tremendous man I could not tell so I
(2:53:24) just wanted to make sure this one from Wayward says let's see they say Andrew
(2:53:30) and Josh demoralized the opposition they literally gave up glory to Jesus Christ
(2:53:36) LSP and classy are you you wouldn't would you say you gave up or would you
(2:53:42) disagree uh yeah I gave up because they're having like a completely different debate than I'm having I give
(2:53:48) up on their first debate their first debate was like a semantic one about like what
(2:53:53) is a woman and they just defin lock themselves and it's like I'm trying to like having more interesting debate than
(2:53:58) like what do we definitionally Define a woman as because what you do with this category of women is kind of more
(2:54:04) important right we only wants to live in science
(2:54:09) fiction tell you're afraid of letting me answer let him finish hangad no the only reason you want to
(2:54:15) like they're they're so interested in defining who is a woman is in woman because they would used to force a law to tell them what they can and cannot do
(2:54:21) like that's the the Crux of their position so I was like well why don't we just debate what the law can and cannot do and then their positions constantly
(2:54:27) like it was like it's like well I'm proving that the data is not conclusive and it's like okay well I'm not arguing
(2:54:33) that the data islu oh well you're arguing that men can magically become women like well I'm not like I'm not making any of these arguments at all so
(2:54:39) yeah they win all those debates against the strongman they direct it well understand that there's two of us
(2:54:45) debating against two of them while I understand LP's POS position of saying there was arguments which were made
(2:54:51) which were against my position you guys did not have the same position so if we make arguments against your debate
(2:54:57) partner who definitely was making arguments on behalf of uh trans
(2:55:03) inclusion based on ABC and D especially on the data where he had to admit it was
(2:55:08) inconclusive and then you did as well you can't blame us for that that's not a straw man that is US responding to your
(2:55:16) partner so what's what's gone on here here is that you constantly say I'm straw Manning you or Josh is straw
(2:55:22) Manning you there's two of you that we're debating now you can't make the claim we're strawmanning you both be
(2:55:29) because we're not and not only that I'm happy to get into the law fair hang on I'm h i just let you speak I'm happy to
(2:55:35) get in to the law fair position of this as well I think you would in fact every
(2:55:40) time I push back against that you [ __ ] agreed with me okay so here's why I say you guys are
(2:55:47) strong man me there would be times where you would say the data isn't conclusive and I would say I'm not arguing it is and then you would just say I don't care
(2:55:53) so you were not ever like engaging with anything I would what I was saying okay hang onal I think that's a fair point I think
(2:56:01) that's a fair point goad go ahead go ahead let you finish yeah yeah go Ahad
(2:56:06) and the other point was like uh no I I my position has conly been the same the entire time in fact it felt like I had
(2:56:12) to really drilled down to get you to say like whether or not we should stand in the way of parents who want to treat their trans kilden I kept saying is it
(2:56:17) your business business right you kept saying no you want to abuse kids then I ask you what to do and you're like well
(2:56:23) we should lock up all the trans people in an institution and force medicate them and then your method of force medication I asked you like if You' be
(2:56:29) okay with gender care and you were just like yes so I felt like we just came full circle well like you went from like
(2:56:34) I don't want the government trans affirming Healthcare the government should force people to can I respond
(2:56:39) though so actually so actually what happened here is you're making a great conflation uh so classy brought up the
(2:56:46) idea of the um you know is is the scientific literature conclusive it's
(2:56:52) not when I told you I don't care it's because you were making a scientific argument and I said if it's not
(2:56:58) conclusive me who love science by the way big fan of it say well if it's not
(2:57:04) conclusive I don't care it has no relevancy to the scientific basis then
(2:57:09) uh I feel in hard facts hard science the scientific method the fals uh being able
(2:57:15) to falsify the hypothesis very important to me or affirm it very important to me
(2:57:20) this is more of a spiritual question I think not a material question I rejoined
(2:57:25) with that but you can't hold it against me that I'm still willing even right this second to go on your Channel with
(2:57:32) your rules you have the mute button everything and have a good faith debate with you based on only specifically what
(2:57:39) it is you want to talk about and you say but Andrew I don't have time for that and it's like well what do you want me
(2:57:46) to do here bro I'm trying to be good faith as I can hang on hang on I want to be as good faith as I can possibly be
(2:57:52) I'm in high demand that's no fault of mine I'm not bragging I just am right so the thing is is like I've got the time
(2:57:59) right this second why don't we just do this okay I don't have the time right this second I put my Discord ID in chat
(2:58:05) I am gained to have this conversation again you want to have this conversation again you can reach out too much James will you do a One V
(2:58:13) one James between me and LSP on whatever it is that he wants to talk about
(2:58:18) okay will will you will you agree to do that yes of course yeah I'm fine with that okay great then James will set it
(2:58:25) up we'll be right back here and then you can't say [ __ ] about straw Manning nothing right there's not not one step
(2:58:31) back we'll do this huh sure all right and I want everyone I want everyone to
(2:58:37) note that literally said after men through threat of force try to gain
(2:58:43) entry into women's Reserve spaces that me and Andrew are going to Strong arm
(2:58:48) through the force of law forbidding them to do that yes we are when true men
(2:58:55) demand access to women's Reserve spaces I am to say I mean I'm not going to do
(2:59:02) that do that well I'm not going to do that I want them to get beat up I understand you're not going to but I
(2:59:08) think that is such an untenable position that LSP is taking it so absurd and ridiculous that he's pretending well
(2:59:15) when this is done you need to come on my channel so I can convince you out of this position I hate this that listen
(2:59:21) you you were great tonight you were a great debate partner this one thing though this one we we gotta talk about
(2:59:27) this bro it's too much let him beat him up let him beat him up tell me why it's right look at your [ __ ] [ __ ] eting
(2:59:32) grin look at your [ __ ] eting green you're like yes they [ __ ] have it coming that's what they voted for it's a
(2:59:39) great talking point but it's like we can wreck these [ __ ] without affirming feminism we don't need to affirm
(2:59:45) feminism Andrew I don't think all women are homogeneous monolithic group there
(2:59:50) are turfs and there are Liberal feminists Liberal feminists ask for this they are getting their just deserts and
(2:59:57) their come upet trans exclusionary radical feminists or just realist
(3:00:02) feminists did not ask for this they recognize question and they don't want it if you were trying to invade the NFL
(3:00:10) and tell them what was what you would get your ass kicked so where where are all the women who are smashing down
(3:00:18) these [ __ ] these insane people who are allowing women sports to be invaded they're nowhere because they're voting
(3:00:24) hang on because they're voting for it just like them let them bear the brunt of the consequences just like you would
(3:00:30) if you went to a sports game and you were rooting for the wrong team just the
(3:00:35) wrong team you might get your ass kicked and you're willing to agree like [ __ ]
(3:00:41) that I don't care if I get my ass kicked I'm still rooting for that team that's that it's like if you're willing to Bear
(3:00:47) the brunt of the consequences let these [ __ ] bear the burn of the consequences too bro Josh I'll give you a chance to respond but I do want to go
(3:00:54) back to the actual questions right after all right go ahead Josh yeah again the
(3:01:00) liberal feminists have asked for it this is their comeuppence I think it's perfect you have a bunch of mentally ill
(3:01:06) misog misogynistic males invading their spaces and doing harm to them but then
(3:01:12) you have people like s Grover JK ring Maya poet many vocal women horrible
(3:01:18) women horrible [ __ ] women they're horrible in every aspect that you can think of I've got to go back to the
(3:01:25) questions who aren't okay with it [ __ ] those women too I'm just paying respect to those
(3:01:33) women who think that these are mentally ill men and they need to get the [ __ ] out of their spaces we'll go to the next question
(3:01:40) this one coming in from do appreciate it ALC says for classy and LSP have you
(3:01:46) ever considered that this quote unquote phenomenon may be nothing more than
(3:01:51) system systematic social psychological brainwashing if you seriously consider
(3:01:56) this you will be able to see it yeah I'm not even against that that proposition
(3:02:02) like I said I'm not even against more government oversight I I I I want the government has an interest in regulating
(3:02:08) this kind of Health Care and making sure that the wrong healthare isn't being given the wrong people I don't disagree with that I've been on that page all
(3:02:14) along I've been arguing people who are who do need this Healthcare not be blocked from getting it they're not they
(3:02:20) have full access to it you know that that's a very R big red herring you know nobody is blocked several states have
(3:02:27) gender gender Doria nobody is blocked from that you yeah and and you know what
(3:02:33) states those States you don't see a problem you don't see a huge problem socially anywhere in those states there
(3:02:39) was a case before The Supreme Court right now because people had a problem with yeah there's there's there's all sort there is obvious there's cases
(3:02:46) before The Supreme Court for all sorts of nonsense that you don't care about ultimately though socially inside of the
(3:02:52) states where they block uh you know these uh puberty interventions their
(3:02:58) [ __ ] kids are doing fine they're doing just fine no they're not there are stories that about people having to go
(3:03:04) to a different state to get their I can't I can't wait I can't wait to do y you got you are the party absolutely you
(3:03:10) guys are the the party of control like you just yes we are yes of course you have to control Society oh it's terrible
(3:03:16) you have to control a society I choose Freedom hang here we go here we
(3:03:21) go here go let's go through it we have to control Commerce we have to control our citizenry we have to have hundreds
(3:03:26) of thousands of laws on the bo work we we have to have no first of all it is how Freedom Market work by the way the
(3:03:32) Greeks the Greeks made famous the saying without law there can be no freedom and
(3:03:37) the reason that they said without law there can be no freedom is because there can't be if you don't have regulations
(3:03:44) you end up with Warlords you fool I'm going to let you
(3:03:50) respond have I never I've always let you respond I've always let you respond I'm
(3:03:56) telling you right now you have not always but go for it absent law there can be no freedom and ultimately yes we
(3:04:02) all have an invested staked interest in the future of our of our of our country
(3:04:07) we do and especially in the children we're not going to let you mutilate them we're not going to let you destroy them
(3:04:13) on inclusive scientific evidence we're not going to let you do that that is totally reasonable not only are we not
(3:04:19) insane I think it's insane as a person who says I heart science for you to try
(3:04:26) to push such a position can you explain that for me okay it's not mutilation
(3:04:32) it's health care and it's a little bit insane that I keep having to contend with the same straw man over and over
(3:04:37) and over again um for ab absent that uh
(3:04:43) you do not own my kid this is not your business you are a guy on the outside who was trying to tell me getting
(3:04:50) between me my child and my doctor to parent my kid on my your be I'm sorry on my behalf and your kid [ __ ] off right
(3:04:57) you you are an absolute fascist not exactly a good thing dude all right I'm telling you freedoms because no I'm not
(3:05:04) freedom freedom works because Freer societies are happier societies and Freer societies are healthier societies
(3:05:09) and part of Freedom means you would get doctors to do the the intervention necessary to save and preserve human life right and you from that you gather
(3:05:16) data so that you can get ideas how to improve this care in the future you can have government oversight of that I am not against government oversight on that
(3:05:23) the you continue to strawman that position because it's the only way you can win this debate I am not against
(3:05:28) government oversight but Freedom means the freedom to explore your options
(3:05:37) capish stop pushing it on kids in school they have the freedom the freedom to not actively hang
(3:05:45) on my ti respond very and he repeated himself very very briefly here first of all the freest Nation on planet Earth is
(3:05:53) Somalia and it's a [ __ ] hole and when you say that the idea here is maximizing
(3:05:59) Freedom you are incorrect you don't want to actually maximize Freedom if you did want to maximize Freedom you would want
(3:06:05) Somalia the freest place on planet Earth which is one of the most horrific because again like I said like the Greek
(3:06:13) said without law there can be no Freedom that's why you have Constitutional Amendments which restrict many behaviors
(3:06:19) of the government and also you have regulations of the people it's totally and completely necessary for you to make
(3:06:26) the Bold claim that it's okay for you from my worldview to abuse your child
(3:06:32) and for me to just let you [ __ ] do it is an absurd proposition on its face you
(3:06:38) say no it's not abuse it's Healthcare but that's the very thing we're arguing about is whether or not it's abuse or
(3:06:44) healthare I don't think it is healthare I think you just want to mutilate your kid and you want me to be okay with it
(3:06:50) and you know what when you say [ __ ] you no [ __ ] you I'm not going to let you hurt your kid [ __ ] I'm not going to
(3:06:57) do it you can kiss my ass and we're GNA do everything we can in order to mobilize the authority of the government
(3:07:03) to stop you from doing that if you think that's fascist then you don't know anything about fascism you don't know
(3:07:08) anything about giovan genti you don't know anything about the mod or the the model of fascism itself which is a model
(3:07:16) of corporatism has zero to do with authoritarianism ultimately zero so I'll
(3:07:22) tell you what uh here's here's my deal to you and I'll send in a super chat for $300 to James right now if you can do
(3:07:29) this if you can complete this challenge just without looking anything up being as good faith as possible tell me what
(3:07:36) the definition of fascism is or what a fascist actually is go ahead hyper
(3:07:42) nationalist authoritarian no no no you're totally [ __ ] wrong it's cor
(3:07:49) corporatist yeah oh nationalist corporatist now you change it no that has nothing to do with fashion fascism
(3:07:56) you can have a complete somewhere on the freedom Spectrum theang hang the freedom
(3:08:01) I don't need you dude you've been G forever you allow me to respond I'm almost done I'm almost done when it
(3:08:06) comes to Communism Communists can have authoritarian dictators a communist can have authoritarian dictators has nothing
(3:08:13) to do with authoritarianism has to do with the body of the state becoming the
(3:08:18) corporate arm of the state you [ __ ] don't you don't even know what you're talking about it's
(3:08:23) absurd okay cool somewhere on the freedom spectrum between Nazi Germany and Somalia is a healthy medium I'm
(3:08:29) saying I want to exist in that Medium a medium where the state does regulate the healthcare people have access to to ensure that Mal medical malpractice
(3:08:35) doesn't happen that's the plan I want to live on but you still have the option to explore the healthcare needs as you see
(3:08:41) fit it's not your kid and it's not your it doesn't matter if you view it as abuse what matters is how my kid and my
(3:08:47) doctor view it that's what matters mind your business has what to do with you calling me a
(3:08:53) fascist mind your business I called you fascist because you're like insanely authoritarian like authoritarianism is
(3:08:59) not fascism okay yeah okay fine whatever so did you want you're very
(3:09:04) authoritarian is you is that you're very authoritarian here thing I'm still gonna be kind enough to send in that Super
(3:09:11) Chat to James even though you lost the bet right even though you lost the bet but I want your promise I want your word
(3:09:17) that you look up what fascism is if I do that do I have your word yeah I'll do right okay woman woman this is my
(3:09:25) authoritarian fascist dictate send in $300 to modern day debate that way we
(3:09:31) know that LSP at least will be educated on the [ __ ] topics he's talking about
(3:09:36) I just want to clarify talk I just want to clarify something I just want to
(3:09:42) clarify something when they say freedom we all know what they mean is the freedom of their cult to run rampant and
(3:09:49) do whatever it wants that's what they mean every time oh we just want freedom we should have a free country where we
(3:09:56) can lie to people and force people to actively participate in whatever the [ __ ] we want even if it's to the
(3:10:02) detriment of children and to you and to your wives and to women that's what they mean by freedom and you have a very
(3:10:08) perverse [ __ ] up definition of freedom go [ __ ] yourself too okay very nice very nice the next
(3:10:17) one uh this one from Short change if you had a question you want me to attach to that Super Chat let me know Jordan says
(3:10:24) question for LSP what is your threshold of abuse for an individual or an institution to infringe on the parental
(3:10:31) rights in protection of a child and once it stops being medically necessary it's kind of
(3:10:40) abusive you got it this one problem we're going to jump to the next one Joshua Jamie says it's IR relevant
(3:10:46) Andrew LOL you just said quote it's an internal critique unquote and then word
(3:10:53) salad specifically tell me how mentioning Eating Disorders is not a non sequor in the trans debate well because
(3:11:01) the internal critique was based around the fact that we need to affirm the medical care of the delusion and so what
(3:11:08) Josh said was well wait a second if that is the case could we not apply that to these other delusional uh things in in
(3:11:16) this case and eating disorder etc etc it's a perfectly valid internal critique
(3:11:22) was there anything else you had idiot this one coming in from do
(3:11:28) appreciate it Joshua Jamie says LSP debunked your theory of [ __ ] gay men
(3:11:34) being transgender women at the beginning of the debate and now you're saying no one refuted it he
(3:11:45) brain I think that's for you Andrew oh you're mute here I am I'm over
(3:11:53) here trying to arrange this $300 Super Chat what was the question James this is from um they say LSP
(3:12:02) debunked your theory of gay men being transgender women at the beginning of the debate Andrew and now you're saying
(3:12:08) no one refuted it you pe brain how how did he refat that there there
(3:12:15) are like a number of women with medical conditions where if you define women strictly by their biology like let's just say female what is a female well a
(3:12:21) female is a person with XX chromosomes uh an ovary a uterus a vagina well
(3:12:26) there's medical conditions which women can be born without any of those right and you would so
(3:12:31) Iden actually that's correct there's only one or two Pathways they can go down uh but regardless of of the pathway
(3:12:39) they go down we know what would be heterosexual so if your physiology was
(3:12:45) determined uh to go down the female if you have sex with men then you're a heterosexual
(3:12:53) simple this one coming in from n ftu says if my aunt had balls she'd be my
(3:13:05) uncle yeah I don't know man that's the conversation you gotta have with your a
(3:13:11) oh uh this one from joshu Jamie says quote
(3:13:16) where wherever they wanted to go we went there unquote they say they're I think they're quoting you Andrew they say
(3:13:22) until it came to LSP debunking your idea that trans women are homosexual men then
(3:13:28) you change the topic soy boy I just addressed it he had he had nothing oh my
(3:13:35) God true so true I addressed it and he had nothing you got demolished my guy
(3:13:40) embarrassing to be you Jesus at least we establish that trans identified men aren't women which destroys everything
(3:13:47) your stupid cult stands for so get back on the phone and let know they're [ __ ]
(3:13:52) [ __ ] my poor cult oh [ __ ] well it's embarrassing I'll bring flowers to the
(3:13:58) funerals let them know they're [ __ ] I know this one coming in from do appreciate your
(3:14:05) question Kai Gallagher says assuming a materialist
(3:14:11) worldview would God be real if someone believed God was real so now assuming materialism do we now give them
(3:14:22) concessions great question I think it's for you LSP or
(3:14:27) classy well I'm not even sure I got that question assuming a mat sorry assuming a materialist world view so let's say
(3:14:34) there's they say if there's no God would God be real if someone believed God was real they say so now assuming
(3:14:41) materialism or atheism do we now give them concessions he he's real in the sense
(3:14:46) that there are people who believe he's real and he's got a mythology Associated and we do give certain concessions for people to worship as they please like
(3:14:52) I'm not against concessions for people to worship do do you affirm that God is real then no well then you're not giving
(3:14:59) me the concession you idiot Welcome to our side
(3:15:06) okay this is uh giving a because it is uh the biggest Super Chat we've ever
(3:15:12) gotten at modern day debate so Rachel Wilson thank you for your $300 Super Chat we really do appreciate the
(3:15:18) crucible crew thank you for your support can you pull it up James it says compliments of the patriarchy with a
(3:15:25) salute and now I held my end LSP you promised you would hold yours yeah H to
(3:15:33) do what that you would actually look into no not not donate money yeah look
(3:15:39) into what fascism actually is so that you wouldn't uh wrongfully call people
(3:15:45) fashist who weren't no it's not corporatism it's no no it's none of
(3:15:51) that you will you hold your word or no oh I did it yeah I'm I'm doing
(3:15:59) it this one but yes thank you very much uh also there are like we I'll try to go
(3:16:04) through it as fast as I can once we get through the standard questions but there were many many super chats from folks
(3:16:10) from The Crucible saying thanks for hosting Andrew so we really do appreciate your support that means a lot
(3:16:15) I am really uh there's a lot of people you know they're like oh you can't you shouldn't Host this person anymore they're too
(3:16:22) controversial and it's just really dumb uh just because I'm like listen we're just going to host anybody and as long
(3:16:29) as it's within YouTube terms of service like we're just going to do it uh and
(3:16:34) which I think is totally reasonable so James has told me before keep it in compliance with the do and I've always
(3:16:42) tried to strive to do that so I have no issues with James he has no issues with me uh if we're here to have a good faith
(3:16:48) debate I feel like I've been extraordinarily good faith this evening whether you like like me or hate me um I
(3:16:55) have a fully monetized Channel I'm I'm All Over YouTube I don't see what the controversy even
(3:17:02) is yes it is impressive that you're still monetized because for example like Daniel hu is a person that sometimes
(3:17:09) people say you can't you know don't host him and he's actually he's demonetized although it was because he was uploading
(3:17:14) like Joe Rogan Clips but nonetheless we love you Daniel but we are yeah I'm just like I don't
(3:17:21) like it when people are like you can host them I don't like that pressure uh so yeah we're gonna keep hosting Andrew
(3:17:27) James sorry I'm really confused are you saying people on the left are trying to limit open dialogue and debate to be
(3:17:35) fair only pockets of people on the left so not that's shocking I can't believe
(3:17:41) that that's weird but huge Kudos I know that right now you guys guys have taken
(3:17:47) such a beating oh man it's so it's been such a blood sporty debate but classy neurotic and LSP I've got to give you
(3:17:53) guys huge credit because you guys are here and you're like hey like we'll debate like here we go and there are
(3:18:00) just so many people that are like I mean there are just so few leftist Debaters
(3:18:05) right now that it's basically a Destiny's Market in other words like Destiny is a big leftist debater or
(3:18:13) liberal have him come on have him come on let's do it let's do it Jam have him come on think blacklisted I'm not
(3:18:19) blacklisted anymore I don't think it's not impossible uh I'll talk but yeah
(3:18:25) yeah so long story short We Appreciate You classy and LSP despite all the abuse you've taken
(3:18:31) tonight I'm so sorry for that I'm uh here for it it was
(3:18:37) fun I hope you never take it personally uh sounds easy for me to say because I
(3:18:42) haven't taken all the abuse but Daman says could a child a could a child who's
(3:18:48) abandoned or feral in the wild be
(3:18:56) trans that's an interesting question it's
(3:19:02) possible this one coming in from do appreciate it Joshua Jamie says
(3:19:07) LOL sorry Joshua says LOL many of these trans people are the greatest
(3:19:14) artists to ever live to say them self uh to say them self deleting is a
(3:19:21) self-correcting problem is pure
(3:19:27) idiocy any thoughts I mean the problem's solved so I don't understand how it's
(3:19:32) not but well ideally you don't want to solve the problem with suicide or mutilating
(3:19:39) people and brainwashing little children and harming women so self- deltion is
(3:19:45) preferable holy [ __ ] oh my God he's not for
(3:19:51) mutilating kids and harming women I can't believe no I get that point the
(3:19:57) part where you're like well them killing themselves is preferable is just the the insane part but okay to mutilating is it
(3:20:03) well hang on is it can I can I can I tell you about a small island off the
(3:20:09) off the coast of poppa New Guinea in this island off that goes to Pap New Guinea I just want to let you
(3:20:16) know that the men there the way that uh you
(3:20:21) gain manhood in this small island I'm not kidding it's called the come Warriors of Papa New Guinea they have
(3:20:27) literal 109-year-old children boys suck off the men in that Island that's how
(3:20:35) they receive manhood if all of those men off themselves would you have a problem with
(3:20:42) that I don't know dog I I answer my question please this is a this is a real this is a real
(3:20:50) answer I don't know you don't know I'd rather like people not like suicide themselves because nobody gets Justice
(3:20:55) in the event somebody does would you rather those men continue to have young boys give them BJs
(3:21:02) really think that's what I'd [Music] rather get or they kill themselves like
(3:21:08) no ARR question You' rather have him arrested yeah I'd rather have him
(3:21:13) arrested that seems like abusive as [ __ ] yeah so you're going to use the authoritarian States who arrest these people Culture by the way did you know
(3:21:21) all the scientific data yep all the scientific data yep all the scientific data which looks at these islands says
(3:21:29) that it's non harmful to those boys okay so would you take that scientific data
(3:21:34) and agree with it and just continue to allow those 10-year-olds to blow those old men or would you send in the mil you
(3:21:43) would of course y you are disgusting yep sure disgusting at least everyone knows
(3:21:49) where you stand morally yep sure this one coming in from hot dogs for sale
(3:21:56) says the three Christ all right I'm gonna be totally honest not that I ever am not but I'm
(3:22:04) gonna be oh sorry sorry go ahead say this hot Mike hot mik hot
(3:22:10) mik this one from the three Christ of yante were put in the same crazy room
(3:22:16) room and each eventually found the other to be mentally ill is there big enough
(3:22:23) room you know I can't say that word in the Super Chat I'll tell you it almost
(3:22:29) rhymes with room the word that they want me to say I don't know if anyone understands
(3:22:34) that but this one coming in from nftu says if my aunt had balls she'd be my
(3:22:42) uncle I'm getting strange Deja Vu uh
(3:22:47) nftu would you have relations with a trans if it's a
(3:22:55) transwoman I think they mean to know a trans woman in the biblical sense would you would you would you uh have cus with
(3:23:04) them who us would we have sex with a transom all of
(3:23:10) you oh yeah I have sex with trans women but you know I've already taken s that's off the menu
(3:23:18) quick question are you uh are you a homosexual bisexual bisexual that's why
(3:23:23) okay got it so he's okay having quitus with men which is why he's okay with having quitus exactly exactly that's
(3:23:31) exactly it yep because they're men yep totally Yep this one from Le says can a man can
(3:23:39) a grown man identify as a little girl can an Asian lady identify as a Mexican dude can an Indian identify as someone
(3:23:47) who smells good oh gosh okay I didn't read that before I said it out loud they
(3:23:53) say pring Common Sense Jesus [ __ ] I can an Indian identify it smells
(3:24:01) good does not make a big issue of that part they say okay yeah I I mean I would say we we
(3:24:09) would just follow like what the medical science is suggesting but trans people have been observed all throughout history I don't know that people like
(3:24:15) identify as a cat I if is tall this is I don't know that there's like
(3:24:20) observations of this being a thing so I don't know to say
(3:24:26) but this one coming in from do appreciate your question bit truth says Andrew
(3:24:33) hypothalamus small sizes found in male and female both and no it's not
(3:24:40) necessarily from mother but from both sounds very inconclusive
(3:24:46) yeah what like like like for instance what can we get what can we get from that what can we what do we what do we
(3:24:55) get from the understanding of this thing does this in some way prove trans
(3:25:01) identity no so the the idea here that oh
(3:25:06) the uh this portion of the brain has more gray matter this one doesn't uh or this or that every single study on brain
(3:25:15) scans every single study book anything you can reference uh in fact I have the
(3:25:22) kind of like ultimate book that everybody goes off of even in this
(3:25:28) particular book in the literature it says this is inconclusive we need more data right and that that by the way is
(3:25:38) the correct way to do science we we don't know we don't know and until we
(3:25:43) know we're not going to make an affirmation of X thing because that would be [ __ ]
(3:25:49) irresponsible this one coming in from do appreciate your question Pitter truth also says male
(3:25:56) gays a specific region of the hypothalamus called the quote third interstitial nucleus of the anterior
(3:26:04) hypothalamus tends to be smaller compared to hetero men
(3:26:11) Andrew which proves what the one from nfu says okay so
(3:26:18) clearly we are only taking questions question for LSP if my aunt had balls
(3:26:24) would she not be my uncle I don't know dude like I said that's a conversation you need to have with your aunt or your your uncle
(3:26:30) whichever it is have that conversation figure out how you feel how will he know which one's his aunt and which is his
(3:26:36) uncle I don't I'm not his aunt or the uncle or the kid well they have to self-identify for him to know which is
(3:26:42) which I don't know that's a conversation they need to have uh James on a real note uh I do only have time for one more
(3:26:50) I'm sorry but I do have to come on man we're right at the Finish Line let's finish it let's finish it come on how
(3:26:56) much longer left James maybe maybe like 20 minutes right James yeah I think that's pretty accurate but if you have
(3:27:03) to go it's not a big deal Josh like you've been here a long time come on let's finish it 20 we only got 20
(3:27:08) minutes let's yeah let's Okay we say let's been going for three and a half hours just do what is it called an Irish
(3:27:15) goodbye if you have leave Rachel Wilson and I'm going to read through all the names and just say all these people said

(3:28:16) journeyman thank you and Nathan slippy and hubit thank you for your super chats
(3:28:24) saying thank you for hosting Andrew this one from Damian peanut
(3:28:31) November says why do leftist want penises in female spaces so
(3:28:38) badly well it's a good question because only 4 to 13% of trans women get bottom
(3:28:44) surgery so obviously if you do the math that means 87 to 96% of trans women are walking around
(3:28:52) with a set of balls and a [ __ ] swinging between their leg so I think if that doesn't give you pause that's a big
(3:28:59) problem so just keep that in mind next time you see a transwoman going into a woman's reserve
(3:29:07) space you got it this one coming in from we're almost caught
(3:29:14) up John quet says Muhammad was a p PDF
(3:29:19) file and a false prophet he remains in the grave to be judged by Jesus Christ Jesus Christ The Living Word of the

(3:29:52) again Rachel Wilson Gavin Free nun says the LSP dude is not representing his side well he's turtling up like someone
(3:29:59) who no longer has the will to debate man's got rolled hard yeah I don't know what I'm supposed
(3:30:05) to debate like every other thing is like you just want to cut off kids dicks uh you know how would you feel about would
(3:30:11) you be okay with like people you know kids blowing like people on this island I don't how to debate like half the [ __ ]
(3:30:17) like yeah I'm capitulating to the dumb [ __ ] because it's just like silly ad hom and [ __ ] not James it's hard when you
(3:30:24) disagree with the Cults Orthodoxy and when you go against the Cults Orthodoxy and LSPs made it clear that he disagrees
(3:30:31) with his cult on a lot of things and so he's in an untenable position and I this entire debate this guy has been debating
(3:30:37) a [ __ ] cult and not me like this is what I'm talking about what am I supposed to respond to half the time said I did not you just said I disagree
(3:30:44) I'm I'm I'm out disagree with lot of the Orthodoxy of the trans cult but you're still a trans cultist and so you have a
(3:30:51) lot of cognitive dist going on I feel sorry I'll give you the last word LSP
(3:30:56) because you just got brutally verbally attacked if you want to say anything
(3:31:01) back he has the he has nothing of substance to say I don't know what to respon to it's like you're an a cult no
(3:31:06) I'm not yes you are like these are the basic tenants of your C should move to the next one not this one from cry more
(3:31:14) bro thanks for your kind words and your support John vqu says John 1 John 5
(3:31:20) Revelation 1 Jesus Christ is the Living Word of the father creator of Heaven and Earth Muhammad lied repent or perish and
(3:31:28) then dark darker thank you for your kinds words says thanks for roing Andrew Thanks James not one step back not one
(3:31:35) step back Jesus Christ is God I think that let me just double check uh I think
(3:31:40) that is the last of our questions I do had well I told I promise this guy give me it'll take two seconds it was like
(3:31:46) really early in the debate and he's like hey bro can you Christian Humphrey says LSP if you don't care what what these
(3:31:52) people think then you have no reason to be upset if their ideology leaks into public and then ultimately affect
(3:31:59) you where the person who's been saying he doesn't care this entire time about Andrew I don't I haven't been saying I
(3:32:04) don't care what they think I care what they think I don't like the way they think but I'm not going to enforce my relief system onto them that's what
(3:32:10) that's how we feel about the trans cult stop forcing your belief system onto Us in I already said I'll stop
(3:32:16) I'll stop send the memo to your cult I'm writing I'm writing a [ __ ] email right now everybody stop leave poor
(3:32:22) Nicole something it's your cult not ours okay well I'll bring it up at the meeting on Thursday last minute one
(3:32:28) techno hippie says awesome debate tonight Josh and Andrew Slade thanks for hosting them James and Christ is God
(3:32:36) thanks Christ is God and uh thank you James you [ __ ] though you were a
(3:32:41) fantastic debate partner um not not uh not great for the affirmation of

(3:35:18) yeah I just wanted to say thank you so much it was a wonderful debate and uh I
(3:35:24) am glad that our interlocutors affirmed that Christ was God until they didn't
(3:35:31) but just remember that that is exactly what we have to deal with on this side
(3:35:37) and uh with that James thank you so much for hosting this it was very kind of you
(3:35:42) I can't thank you enough um James has always been been uh very good at The Crucible we've had our tiffs that's the
(3:35:49) way it goes in the online world and you know what you do you get the [ __ ] over them so thank you James I appreciate it
(3:35:55) very much thanks
(3:36:01) James thank you
(3:36:22) all right thank you sir have a good night take care
(3:36:28) thanks yeah
(3:36:34) [Music]
(3:36:45) thank you guys so much for your support I agree with Andrew is that sometimes you disagree with each other uh
(3:36:52) sometimes you even have a little tiff uh but especially men uh my football coach when I was in like ninth grade I've told
(3:36:58) this story before it's just because it's so memorable for me is that he had said he's like sometimes you guys on the
(3:37:04) football team are going to fight and he's like that's just like not a big deal don't make a big deal out of it it's like okay you fought you got in a
(3:37:10) fight with somebody but that's just like the main nature of men is that some sometimes they fight and then they're
(3:37:16) over it and like you know even though they were punching each other like they were rolling on the ground wrestling punching and then 5 minutes later
(3:37:23) they're like all right well it's done you know they just put it behind them they don't even it's just there's no like residual emotion they really can
(3:37:30) just it's done and so that is how Andrew and I have decided we're going to roll
(3:37:35) uh we have no hard feelings toward each other we think that holding a grudge is a feminite and lame so we're just like
(3:37:42) hey uh especially if it's a win-win for both sides es in terms of modern day debate hosting Andrew and
(3:37:50) modern day debate growing which it it definitely does it helps a ton to have Andrew and we hope that it helps Andrew
(3:37:58) as he comes on modern day debate and we also of course hope it helps everybody so I'm not trying to uh play favorites
(3:38:05) with Andrew is that we do appreciate that there are leftists that are willing to come on because they are
(3:38:12) uh a little bit of a dir of who want to debate in other words a
(3:38:17) shortage and that's why it is a huge help when we do find leftists um I don't
(3:38:23) know what it is it is interesting but there are just so many conservative Debaters um and I'm not saying that
(3:38:30) there's like some sort of like lack of Courage if this seems like people oh James is picking on leftist I'm not
(3:38:36) doesn't have to be a lack of Courage there could be other explanations uh that's just one
(3:38:41) potential explanation that some people might say but there are are indeed many
(3:38:47) conservatives in fact it's interesting that even the the women conservatives there are just so many popular ones that
(3:38:53) are oftentimes willing to at least participate in a panel like Sydney
(3:39:01) Watson Lauren Southern uh isn't there another Lauren
(3:39:07) but there are a lot of conservative big-timers thanks for your support your Super Chat John Kell there are a lot of
(3:39:14) super there are a lot of uh super big time conservative women in the
(3:39:19) like YouTube political sphere but there are not like a lot of like left leaning
(3:39:25) ones which is strange to me I don't understand why that is so I don't know why that is um I don't know let me know
(3:39:33) in chat but it's just like one of my musings where I'm like why is it
(3:39:39) that like there are way more big content creators who are women
(3:39:45) who are conservative but then on the left like they're just not in the political sphere
(3:39:51) yeah Lauren Chen that's the other Lauren thanks for that zense uh but then on the left it's like um Contra points but
(3:40:00) Contra points doesn't even really debate and some people would say well but Contra points is like a transwoman so
(3:40:06) some people would say like but are there any like CIS women like non-trans women
(3:40:12) and I'm that like are into like the political debates being scen and debating and things like that in the
(3:40:18) same way that like Destiny and Vos are um there's like Kyle klinski
(3:40:23) obviously he's a guy not a woman uh he's a
(3:40:29) guy David Pacman uh so there are some big ones out there uh like dudes besides
(3:40:37) Destiny and vosch but it is weird that it's like where why are there no women on the left side that debate uh that are
(3:40:44) like big time it's just I don't know if there's an audience on the left for like women content creators that comment
(3:40:52) on political stuff I don't know I'm not sure why it is but obviously yeah
(3:40:59) there's like Lauren Chen Lauren Southern um if you count Shu on head I don't it's
(3:41:05) kind of a gray area uh cydney Watson uh melany Mac people who have like hundreds
(3:41:11) of thousands subscri subscribers uh yeah so that's interesting especially because you'd be
(3:41:17) like well James it's like it's because conservatives have like more women in their group um like and it's like well
(3:41:25) no like women tend to vote more on the left right so like
(3:41:32) why like it's not that conservatives have more women in their Camp if
(3:41:38) anything they have more men right that wasn't that the anyway but uh I killed Earl says I'd like to debate Andrew on
(3:41:44) his feminist stance hey we're willing to host it if you want to do it we're happy to have you and we'll make sure it's a
(3:41:50) fair debate and yeah so cry more bro uh
(3:41:57) says Destiny's the final boss of leftist Debaters that seems
(3:42:03) uh probably true Vos doesn't even debate anymore it's so hard so we're right now
(3:42:09) I'm working on our debate con conference it's going to be in February and
(3:42:18) it's tough to find a lot of left-leaning content
(3:42:23) creators because Destiny's basically retired there's people like David Pacman
(3:42:29) but David Pacman's still kind of out of our price range until the end of the year and I'm not trying to slam David
(3:42:35) for wanting to be compensated like he I think frankly I think he knows his worth like he's a very popular YouTuber David
(3:42:42) Pacman like his time is very valuable so I would do the same thing if I was him I'd say hey you know this is my
(3:42:48) honorarium cost so that's just reasonable but yeah we're we're working
(3:42:54) toward getting David Pacman against Andrew Wilson this fall so I do think that even though this
(3:43:01) February it's going to be tough to make that happen just financially modern debate isn't going to be in a position to do that it's just a big leap forward
(3:43:09) we are taking a leap upward in terms of Lawrence Krauss is going to be a big uh
(3:43:15) name that we're gonna have and I killed ear says Destiny has retired if I said Destiny I meant to say vosch vosch is
(3:43:22) basically um I wouldn't say retired you know because he's young and I'm sure he'll come back at some point I think
(3:43:29) but vosch like doesn't really debate nearly as much as he did like whenever I reach out to him he's like n he's like
(3:43:34) I'm kind of taking time away from it um oh yeah yeah crime or bros says not so aidite yeah that's a good point
(3:43:42) so fi popular I'm not trying to she's got like 10,000 uh YouTube subscribers
(3:43:49) or Twitter followers so like that's a respectable you know like a good start
(3:43:56) and Damen P nut November says please put Rob no against Pacman huh uh Rob is a
(3:44:03) very good debater I will admit that his skills he's like was he was like on a debate team in college and it clearly
(3:44:11) shows like he is exceptionally skilled uh uh bite me XD thanks for your Super
(3:44:17) Chat says uh gz on drct on the Doctor James glad to see you back thank you for
(3:44:23) your support I appreciate that is um man it's so good to be done with school and
(3:44:29) it's also I love I am currently enjoying oh wow shellshock
(3:44:36) says 50,000 Subs does not every day really that's like wow that's a lot like
(3:44:42) especially for she hasn't been in the space that long long so for her to do that is like wow she grew faster than
(3:44:48) modern day debate uh cuz for us it took wow she is at 50,000 okay you're right
(3:44:55) okay is and some of her videos too are
(3:45:00) bangers so she's got this one uh I'm looking at her Channel right now oh her
(3:45:05) thumbnails are beautiful like these are these are based as the kids say is it's
(3:45:11) got like a picture these are good for her so yeah there is
(3:45:16) one uh like I said it's still I'm not trying to be picky but it's just that like Lauren Chen had
(3:45:23) like before her Channel got yeed from YouTube it had like 750,000 but you get the point but yeah I
(3:45:30) admit that she's actually like so kind of yeah uh let's
(3:45:35) see but we were excited modern day debate we will have debate con Saturday
(3:45:40) February 15th and Sunday February 16th we are inv Andrew Wilson so we possibly
(3:45:48) inviting uh not so aidite uh they're not going to debate each other it' be a separate debate um we are probably GNA
(3:45:56) uh invite another uh person that Andrew has Crossed Swords with before namely uh Jasmine so it's another
(3:46:05) uh woman content creator on the left who popular well spoken and she'll probably
(3:46:12) be debating TR oh Ariel oh that's another one too Ariel
(3:46:17) scarcella you could kind of yeah I mean she I think she came out as like Pro Trump she's got like 400,000 subscribers
(3:46:23) or something right so the right is it's but it's also I'm like maybe it's just
(3:46:29) that the right is more like they spend more time on YouTube or something um and
(3:46:35) that would make sense 776 oh gosh like she has almost double what I was thinking and Ariel scar oh
(3:46:42) and then yeah so shellshock says I'm so waiting for
(3:46:48) James to put me on the show uh shellshock I am open to that we it is a little bit tougher because you are in
(3:46:54) Europe so I have to like work around your uh you your European Time Zone and political debates are hard for us at
(3:47:01) modern day debate they're on average not as popular compared to our other topics for some reason Flat Earth is the most popular
(3:47:09) topic I can't help it but it is all things equal
(3:47:15) Flat Earth so um religion debates do really well uh but yeah Green Lord
(3:47:21) thanks for coming by I want to do I do want to say thank you for being subscribers and also thanks for being uh channel members kmore bro thanks for
(3:47:27) being a channel member supporter I killed Earl thanks for being a channel member supporter
(3:47:32) um Billy mlan uh am I saying it right said love seeing Andrew on the channel immediately subbed thanks for your
(3:47:39) support oh yeah yeah if you haven't yet hit that subscribe button we do appreciate your support we are excited
(3:47:44) as modern debate is about to hit uh 202,000 subscribers so that's epic we uh
(3:47:50) are like 16 away so that actually could be like right now if if there are 16 of you out there that hit subscribe right
(3:47:57) now who are not already subscribed we will hit that right now during the stream so thank you uh it's always
(3:48:02) exciting to hit another new thousand Mark but yeah I gotta say oh let me get this there we go is I want to say hello
(3:48:10) to you and thank you in the old live chat Eco brain thanks for being a subscriber thanks for being a subscriber shell shock and then quickly quietly
(3:48:17) silently thanks for being a subscriber thanks for your support I killed Earl says hit the like buttons and yeah
(3:48:24) that's right if you are subscribed I killed Earl thank you
(3:48:31) for letting me know or I should say bringing this up because I never mention it if you are like James I don't really
(3:48:38) get recommended your videos the debates very often why not is uh just the way YouTube
(3:48:47) is is like your subscription to a channel on YouTube doesn't mean what it used to you guys have probably figure
(3:48:53) this out by now and this is old news it used to be that when you were subscribed to a channel YouTube would like always
(3:48:59) recommend that channel but YouTube is like clever where they basically are like will recommend it but if you don't
(3:49:05) click on it on that video from this channel you subscribe to like if you keep not clicking on videos that we try
(3:49:11) to recommend you we're not going to show them to you anymore so uh subscribers count doesn't mean as
(3:49:17) much as it used to on YouTube but so that's why you will at least increase the probability if you hit the Bell
(3:49:23) notification as I killed Earl said that actually is giving a signal to YouTube like hey like really do show me these
(3:49:30) really do recommend these to me I did that today on a channel uh it's called the big one it's like a radio station uh
(3:49:36) very innocuous like nothing it's not right or left or anything and I uh just
(3:49:41) hit the bell and let's see uh because I was thinking I
(3:49:48) was like huh I was like I don't really see their videos as much as I want I like this new channel and I want
(3:49:54) to know when every single video comes out so I have hit the Bell uh but yeah Darth ducky thanks for
(3:50:00) your uh being a subscriber and also Alex ODU thanks for being a subscriber troll
(3:50:08) thanks for being a channel member we appreciate that Chad zagone thanks for
(3:50:13) being a subscriber says thanks for having Andrew on thank you grenzy Katy thank you for being a
(3:50:20) subscriber and Zen thank you for your being a subscriber
(3:50:26) and yeah Zen is right so YouTube basically realized what uh Netflix
(3:50:32) noticed if uh Netflix did basically some research into their own like users they found that people would commonly put in
(3:50:39) their watch list these like you could say more enlight
(3:50:45) or more like sophisticated videos like you know it' be like you know like a a
(3:50:51) very like artistic video or you movie that was like very like kind of like
(3:50:56) high brow and you know like you might say intellectually sophisticated type
(3:51:02) videos or movies but even though those were what people would put in their watch list what the actually watch on
(3:51:09) Netflix would be like trash you know it's like they watch like reality TV or you know something on that level
(3:51:15) or they you know they watch the like if they're like me they watch like the robot you know big robots fighting each
(3:51:21) other in movies like Transformers like I don't I'll be honest like I don't watch
(3:51:26) intellectually like highbrow movies I'm usually watching a movie to rest my brain so I'm just like want to I want to
(3:51:33) watch giant robots or big gorillas fight or something and the point is Netflix
(3:51:39) was like ah so YouTube basically said the same thing
(3:51:44) they like well people subscribe to channels that they think like that they aspire to
(3:51:50) watch but what do they actually watch when they come on to YouTube like do they watch it's like well a lot of times
(3:51:56) they just click on the first thing that looks like it'll be just fun to watch amusing because think of like the word
(3:52:03) amuse it's like it's like uh ah a as in
(3:52:09) lack of something uh kind of like atheist like lack of and then Muse is to
(3:52:15) think right so ause is basically meaning if it's an amusing video it's
(3:52:21) like you're not thinking during it you're just you're amused you're just entertained but let let's see a dear EST
(3:52:28) far faera thanks for your being a subscriber and a channel
(3:52:34) member and yeah so let's see Dylan Moz
(3:52:39) thanks for being a subscriber the panel verse would you just relax you're obsessing with Andrew you can just if
(3:52:46) you want to debate Andrew Wilson the panel verse or uh I killed Earl my email
(3:52:54) is modern day debate gmail.com uh we can ask Andrew I can't guarantee it I think he's going to be
(3:52:59) open to I killed Earl but um the panel verse bro you're just looking kind of
(3:53:05) crazy in the chat you're like I'm not trying to be mean but you were using like all caps the entire night in live
(3:53:12) chat the panel verse and you were also just like Andrew is bad and it's like
(3:53:18) well Andrew is like not really even able to defend himself right now because he's like in the middle of a debate and
(3:53:23) you're trying to trash his reputation in live chat so he's probably not going to want to debate you bro uh
(3:53:30) like but yeah Green Lord thanks for being here KCA Randy thanks for being
(3:53:37) here says greeting James I assume Andrew was let's see yes it was very it was a very Lively debate and but yeah uh
(3:53:45) Justin thanks for your Super Chat says thanks for hosting Andrew thank you I appreciate your support and let's see
(3:53:51) are we at the 4our uh Mark we're creeping up on the old 4H hour mark I
(3:53:57) should probably go to bed it's a is it really 10 here holy smokes I yeah I gotta go I'm sorry I gotta get up for a
(3:54:03) meeting tomorrow so I want to say thank you guys for your support we're excited about the future debate con Newark New
(3:54:10) Jersey if you live anywhere near near Newark New Jersey so like New York City
(3:54:15) Philadelphia even all the way down there in Washington DC
(3:54:21) Baltimore you don't want to miss debate con five so this is our fifth conference
(3:54:28) it's going to be huge it's going to be this February 15th and 16th we are
(3:54:34) absolutely stoked for it uh get a job thanks for coming by I
(3:54:40) see you there uh let's see I see you there get a job it's uh I
(3:54:46) watch a lot of lot of videos from get a job and then uh grenzy says if you say
(3:54:52) so hello thank you for saying hi Christian Humphrey good to have you here thanks for your kind words it's great
(3:54:58) debate thanks for hosting and then uh I killed Earl I'm I'm pretty sure I killed
(3:55:03) Earl that I'm like I'm glad that your blog is doing well and I do think it helps if uh it always helps but Andrew
(3:55:11) is like pretty open debating people so even if you like I think it's probably I think it's likely Andrew will go for it obviously
(3:55:18) be aware that Andrew is kind of a rabid sometimes so I don't know if you
(3:55:25) if you're willing to deal with a blood sport type of debate like the olden days
(3:55:32) I don't know if a lot of you guys have been around but modern day debate in part was inspired by warski live no joke
(3:55:43) now I actually myself never watched warski live that was like before I got into like the political debates and
(3:55:49) stuff uh but I'm sure some of you guys know who what that is I uh had a friend
(3:55:56) who did watch it though and he said so basically when I was starting a YouTube
(3:56:01) channel this is like the summer before I started my doctorate so this is like six years ago and I was like yeah I really
(3:56:08) want to start a YouTube channel I'm still figuring out what I want to do and he's like you should do a debate Channel like just devoted to debate and I was
(3:56:15) like H I don't know cuz I feel like it's not my channel and in a way it's not and
(3:56:20) that's okay like modern day debate like we are dependent on our Network like The Debaters are the lifeblood of the
(3:56:27) channel so uh yeah but no joke zense is that for
(3:56:34) real is we uh warsky live is the idea
(3:56:41) basically um him and JF yeah so back when warski and JF like did that show my
(3:56:48) buddy Andy uh he used to watch it and he's like you should do a show like this and that was like while warski live was
(3:56:54) just coming down I think it was like kind of falling apart um but he was like
(3:57:00) yeah he's like this is a cool idea and so I was like okay you know I didn't want to do it because it's like I feel
(3:57:06) like it's not really my channel because you know everybody when you do a YouTube channel kind of like people want to be
(3:57:11) like this is my channel you know like I'm it's me you know like I'm the center of it and in a real way like I'm not the
(3:57:18) center of it I'm like the person who decides what debates happen but uh like Ryan's hosting most
(3:57:26) of them last month for example uh because we have so many flat Earth debates and I don't want to I don't want
(3:57:33) to host those so I make Ryan do it but he likes it like he enjoys it so um but
(3:57:41) yeah it was basically I didn't want to do it cuz I was like well I feel like it's not really my show cuz you know The Debaters are the the way a good debate
(3:57:48) show is is
(3:57:54) basically it's that The Debaters are the ones in
(3:58:00) the spotlight it's not supposed to be me as the host right that's why I don't
(3:58:05) talk like almost at all during the actual debate I'll do this like afterwards but even then like I don't
(3:58:11) say which side I thought was more persuasive or like oh that side had such bad
(3:58:16) arguments like that's like super lame I don't uh it just doesn't fit modern day
(3:58:22) debates brand thanks for your kind words AG I appreciate that and it's okay though but yeah I mean I love I
(3:58:29) obviously feel like I'm a big part of modern day debate I guess kind of like the it's like the ship of thesis is
(3:58:34) because I was thinking about it the other day and I was like man modern day debate has always had people that have helped so much The Debaters
(3:58:44) the volunteers of the conferences the
(3:58:49) mods patreon supporters channel members like uh subscribers like just everybody
(3:58:55) like makes this what it is and uh I was thinking like who like
(3:59:02) what's the like common denominator from the very start I was like well I mean I guess I am it's like there's like a
(3:59:08) single board on thesis's ship that was like the same board you know that was
(3:59:13) like a board that helped make up the uh floor of like the ship let's say that's the
(3:59:20) only piece that's like remained otherwise every other piece of like although we've had like some Debaters that have you know been regulars on
(3:59:26) modern day debate for the long long time trying to think of like who are our earliest ones once in a while we still
(3:59:32) have t jump on and T jump was like one of the first like sometimes it was like
(3:59:37) you know it's like me and T jump just debating and that was like you know I'd have somebody else be the mod because I
(3:59:43) just like philosophy religions was like oh it's cool like I'll jump in and do it and then it was got to the point where I
(3:59:49) was like H I really want to focus on like developing our Network and stuff and that's what's made Modern Day debate
(3:59:55) I think good is that you got people from like all these different uh it's like Lord of the Rings like you've got the
(4:00:01) elves uh and then you've got like the uh the dwarfs and then over here you have the
(4:00:08) hobbits it's like that and uh you know oh so you have to be able to have
(4:00:15) friends from all with be friends with all these different like groups the elves the hobbits and that way you can
(4:00:22) have think somebody from the elves come and debate somebody from the dwarfs and that's what modern day debate is so we
(4:00:29) appreciate though your guys' support you guys have made this for real you guys have made this channel epic so we do
(4:00:34) appreciate your support like it's it really means more than you know
(4:00:40) I never imagined that this would become like 200,000 subscribers and I honestly
(4:00:47) think no joke this uh our goal is to hit quarter
(4:00:52) Million by the end of this year so it's probably going to be some slower growth at the beginning of the
(4:00:58) year 2025 or so I should say 2025 so about a year from now we're hoping to be at 50,000 more or so subscribers
(4:01:06) compared to right now and it's going to be really it's going to be really dependent on to a significant degree uh
(4:01:13) debate Con in February will make a difference and then debate Con in the fall will make a huge difference I think
(4:01:19) that by the Fall that's when we are shooting for like some bigger we're going to really shoot for the stars we're going to like really swing for the
(4:01:24) Home Run type conference so yeah we are excited about the future though and we want to say thank you for
(4:01:31) all your support we are uh it's hard for me to just say how much I am excited
(4:01:36) about it and I appreciate you guys thank you for your kind words kiss me I see you there in the old live chat thanks

(4:02:12) about the future we'll see you next one keeps lifting out the reasonable from the unreasonable let me just double check
(4:02:19) one thing really quick we are five subscribers away from
(4:02:26) 202,000 so for real if there are there five people in chat right now that have not subscribed are there five people
(4:02:32) that are hearing my voice right now because there's 483 listening right
(4:02:37) now is there's 483 listening right now
(4:02:44) and that uh you know could theoretically be more than that because sometimes there might
(4:02:50) be two people in the same room listening to modern day debate together uh so we are five subscribers
(4:02:57) away from 22,000 subscribers so I'm excited if you
