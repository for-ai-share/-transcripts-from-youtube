(0:01) what's up guys we are live so we have a pretty [ __ ] epic debate for you today we did one of these last weekend uh the
(0:08) one with Destiny Andrew not so our guide and uh Grace Thorpe and it was juicy as
(0:13) [ __ ] so we'll see if we can top that this one so we got Lauren delugina I'm pronouncing her name correctly de Laguna
(0:20) De Laguna joining us Andrew you guys know him Angela Knight and Nina
(0:25) um so why don't we start off Andrew everyone knows who you already and everyone knows who you are Lauren you're coming to my channel so can you give a
(0:31) quick introduction I am trying to be a lawyer and in the
(0:39) meantime I'm doing content creation and you could find me on YouTube at Lauren day Laguna
(0:45) okay cool Angela I'm pretty sure most people know who you are the Angela the girl who ended mld's career but just
(0:51) give a quick introduction anyway uh hi Angela Knight full-time housewife
(0:57) part-time [ __ ] I'm here that's it all right cool all right guys so we're gonna be debating two topics
(1:03) um number one is going to be why is it that women initiate 80 of divorces and number two does body count Lower a
(1:10) woman's uh inherent dating value so we're gonna we're gonna do about 45 minutes to an hour for each topic or if
(1:17) the one topic gets stale I'll just transition next topic we'll do about two to three minute introductions and then
(1:23) it's gonna be pure freestyle format I will only step in if it's getting ridiculous and one person can't talk but
(1:29) generally you guys probably won't hear much from me uh the only thing I'll be doing is just if the conversation gets really really off topic and starting to
(1:36) get weird or if one person can't talk those are the only times I will come in but other than that it's going to be pretty much toll-free for all so anyway
(1:42) so we're gonna start off with the topic of why do women initiate 80 of divorces we're just gonna give a quick opening
(1:48) statement uh Lauren you want to kick it off since you're the first one in the order yeah I don't think it's as uh people say
(1:55) that initiating divorce is a sign that that's the person ending the relationship but that's just the person
(2:00) who's initiating the legal process and the reason that women would tend to do
(2:05) that is because they are frequently the ones who are relying financially on the man and if they are not receiving uh so
(2:13) for instance if a man is married to a woman and then cuts her off financially and leaves uh he may
(2:20) have ended the relationship but she has to go through the divorce process in order to start debating the money in
(2:26) order for her to survive so that's a very frequent reason and yeah
(2:31) I'll go south uh Andrew you're up next my name yeah the reason that you have such a
(2:38) high divorce rate in the west is due to no fault divorce it's a massive problem the reason that no fault divorce was
(2:45) implemented to begin with is because of feminism and egalitarianism which is completely in totally the wrong way to
(2:51) go about life it's completely false it's um it's foe in every every direction
(2:57) there is no such thing as egalitarianism is made up tripe and it's been pushed by a feminist agenda for roughly 200 years
(3:03) and uh yeah that's uh that's why you see such a high rate of divorce as due to no
(3:08) fault and we know this because we go back before no fault we can compare and you can see the distinction is massive
(3:16) so I think that you should have merit-based divorce and that irreconcilable differences aren't good
(3:22) enough and I also think that secularists probably shouldn't get married at all because it's for the religious and it
(3:27) has nothing to do with them what the hell do they need to get married for to begin with so
(3:37) uh non-religious people should get married part I wholeheartedly agree with that uh Nina you're up next
(3:45) uh there's a lot in that sentence that needs to be addressed later but just in
(3:51) general divorce is really complicated it comes from a lot of different factors on both sides of course
(3:56) um I think that a lot of uh factors specifically with women typically come from like
(4:02) um like having more of like a social network that you can rely on um actually being
(4:07) willing to take those steps uh instead of a lot of dudes I think are just kind of like even if they're unhappy they
(4:13) just kind of like stick it out in terms of like um
(4:19) like well I'm supposed to be married and if I have this like failure
(4:24) if I divorce my wife it's like a social stigma um obviously that goes on both sides but
(4:30) I think it does hit differently for dudes who are not willing to like uh generally
(4:36) they're kind of [ __ ] sometimes when it comes to actually taking that step they'll just be like whatever I guess
(4:41) I'll just die um I think the no fault divorce thing is really [ __ ] stupid of you saying that
(4:48) that's like a bad thing because back in the day you either just made up an excuse like had there was literally
(4:54) businesses that were completely built around the idea of like faking cheating
(4:59) allegations so you could get a divorce so it kind of just was like a it just wasn't a very efficient way to
(5:05) go about doing it so it really all it is with having no-fault divorces now just
(5:11) means that either you're not having to poison your husband anymore or flush and you don't have to go
(5:19) through all these [ __ ] Hoops to just like leave because it's not like it just worked on one side it worked on both
(5:25) sides you couldn't just like leave your wife you can just leave your husband like it was not good for either side so
(5:30) I just think that's very silly for you to support that okay let's go to Angela
(5:37) um yeah so uh they're like I kind of agree with Nina and Lauren there are so many reasons why I really should that I
(5:43) think one of the main the majors uh I think men and women truly don't understand what it takes to coexist in a
(5:48) relationship and those a woman is initiating a divorce doesn't necessarily I mean she's ending it I think there's a lot of things that are stabilizing
(5:54) really bad relationships and a woman choosing to initiate or end the relationship or the divorce
(6:00) um it's just her deciding to I don't know take care of the situation as to a guy is probably having an affair or
(6:05) coping in other ways with video games or just being complete slob or just giving up in life
(6:11) um I think that maybe like The Narrative of men feeding into this egalitarian uh
(6:17) lifestyle or marriage thinking that they can do that but I think women are still carrying the burden of being
(6:22) domestically uh responsible in the relationship whether it's still working and being the
(6:28) wife and being the mom and being all above while he's still harboring like traditional wife core values which I
(6:34) don't really think it aligns with what we're pushing out here so just summing it up all right cool so we kind of got
(6:40) everyone's position so now is the free-for-all portion anyone can speak at any time okay get off guys
(6:46) hey Nina did you say that um the only way that men could get it or women could
(6:51) get out of their evil marriages before no fault divorce was to poison their husbands I just want to make sure that we're clear
(6:57) uh did I say that that's the only reason or only way that they could get out no well you know because you were concerned
(7:02) about the massive non-existent industries that were out trying to prove that you know the women were cheating
(7:08) and I guess that if they couldn't get a divorce their only option of course was to poison their husbands uh that seems
(7:16) ridiculous to me I'm sure that you have lots of I think that it's not something that was
(7:21) prevalent yeah okay so how would you get out of a divorce or get sorry get out of a
(7:27) marriage back in the day without no fault divorce like if you wanted to go you would go do what's called show cause
(7:32) so you would show a cause and then the court would Grant you the divorce
(7:40) show of cause what was the cause back then Andrew well it could be any number of different factors so infidelity could
(7:47) be one factor there was all sorts of different factors it just wasn't irreconcilable differences I actually
(7:53) had to have a Cause
(8:00) have uh that's one factor yeah so
(8:08) partners because in order to get out of their divorce they had a have some or
(8:13) false accusations of cheating whereas and these things could have led to
(8:18) criminal process no fault divorce hasn't changed that no fault divorce hasn't changed to ridiculous allegations of
(8:25) cheating hasn't changed any of the ridiculous allegations that are that are levied at people so
(8:30) the thing is is that just saying that there were some isolated cases where they would make these bold claims of uh
(8:37) of Lies it doesn't it doesn't mean anything it's like first of all the overwhelming amount of divorces right
(8:43) now are due to irreconcilable differences not due to any other Factor so I don't assume that something that's
(8:50) something because we have polling data we have polling data we have polling data no we don't yes we do so what we
(8:58) have is data that shows that people are filing no fault divorces however you
(9:04) could file for a no-fault divorce which is much easier than filing for a at fault divorce and having to show cause
(9:11) as you talk talked about earlier so even if you do have just cause for a show of
(9:16) cause divorce you would typically just go for a no-fault divorce so your data is what does that have to do with
(9:22) anything that literally has nothing to do with what I'm talking about so I'm making a comparison and saying that that
(9:29) why do you think that people who say now men and women now the women are saying
(9:34) we have irreconcilable differences and that's why we're getting divorced so because it's easier let me finish let me
(9:41) explain me or I cheat on my husband Lauren calm down let me finish my point
(9:46) and I'll let you talk so you have to make the case then that before the irreconcilable differences
(9:53) that people were getting divorced before this under some false pretense which I don't think that they were I think that
(9:59) they were getting divorced under the pretense of show cause which they were supposed to be getting divorced under right you did something wrong you did
(10:06) something which was outside of your marital vows because remember you are taking a vow you do you remember that
(10:11) part Lauren if we were to get married part of our vows would be you would never tell me to calm down again we
(10:16) would never get married I'm happily married I'm glad that um
(10:24) don't tell women to calm down it doesn't help in getting women to calm down oh no
(10:30) what are you gonna do freak out oh that's terrible but anyway back to where I was at before I was so rudely
(10:37) interrupted by you Lauren I'd like to note that you still haven't actually given me anything here so what I'm
(10:43) asking you specifically is what is the problem with no fault divorce other than you want to get a divorce because you
(10:49) just don't like your husband anymore the reason that I have to issue with no
(10:55) fault divorce is because you have to make in order to get a divorce you have to make some sort of an accusation so
(11:02) you have to either accuse your husband of cheating on you or or of hitting you or doing something and a lot of those
(11:09) times this would lead to criminal proceeding so if you feel drastically stuck it puts you in a very hard
(11:15) difficult position if you really need to leave and also um even if you do have just cause
(11:23) having to gather that evidence so let's say your husband does abuse you in some
(11:28) manner I'm not sure or does cheat on you you would then have to get that gather that evidence and a lot of women don't
(11:34) have the means to hire a pi or to follow their husbands around kind of enjoying
(11:39) the gynocentric way that you're looking at this it's a it's not just the oh the
(11:44) poor woman has to the poor woman has to gather
(11:49) evidence the man also has to gather evidence man has gather evidence for infidelity as well I can gather evidence
(11:55) for these things as well they both have to show cause because they took a vow so if you don't want to take a if you don't
(12:01) if you don't if you don't want to take a vow a marriage vow then why are you getting married
(12:06) we'll probably feel like the legal reasons you know so like what oh sure
(12:12) you can't so we can't change the tax system unless people are married that's ridiculous it's ridiculous okay do you
(12:19) find the Constitution ridiculous you seem like a fervent supporter of United States and the Constitution why would
(12:26) you say that based on because earlier you said that people who are not religious shouldn't be married and it's
(12:31) like funny because we have a first what does that have to do with the Constitution well we also have a constitutional right to get married it's
(12:39) you do yeah loving the Virginia yeah that's a constitutional that's a constitutional right which amendment is
(12:46) that it's um I don't think it's in the amendment it's
(12:53) so it's not of the Constitution Lauren and determined by the Supreme Court to be a constitutional right okay so it's
(13:00) not in the Constitution Lauren yeah they can't the government the United States cannot prevent you it's part of your
(13:06) rights to life liberty so is it in the Constitution Lauren can you give me the amendment Lauren do you not understand how a supreme
(13:12) court presses yeah vice president the question could be overruled right
(13:21) for instance it was a constitutional right to have an abortion under a case
(13:28) that was recently overturned so now that's no longer a constitutional right because it's precedent because yes
(13:34) exactly so you do understand yeah but president's not a constitutional right so if you have a constitutional
(13:40) amendment you either either let me finish Lauren you need to either have two-thirds of the states come
(13:46) together to roll the amendment back or you need to have literally an act yeah yeah well if it's not
(13:54) and you said it you said it's in the Constitution it's not in the Constitution you're you're talking about
(14:00) case precedent the 10th Amendment the Tenth Amendment it says that the rights that aren't given to the federal
(14:06) government go to the prospective States Lauren what are you talking about no it's the 10th Amendment
(14:12) s of rights that are not specifically outlined in the Constitution like I just said
(14:18) yeah which part of my are you disagreeing with institutional right
(14:23) people have a constitutional right to choose whom they marry whether they be inter race or and then it was further in
(14:29) Hodges be overfeld with gay marriage so people have to choose to the right to choose who they marry that is a
(14:36) constitutional right it's not a constitutional right it's an interpretation by the Supreme Court and
(14:43) they often get overruled later whereas you can't the Supreme Court overruled
(14:48) the amendment you're right for anyone in the United States to get married to whom they choose whether or not they're
(14:54) religious and I find it odd even though the first event so then I can't Advocate that there's change so you're just going
(15:00) to continue to interrupt me and then get upset when I interrupt you you see it well it seems to be impossible to have a
(15:06) conversation with you unless it's the most long-winded diatribe I've ever heard try to keep your points more
(15:11) concise I think it's hard for you to understand big big Concepts I get that
(15:17) I'm trying my hardest maybe if you use small words okay I'll try from now on
(15:23) so Andrew are you in favor of a small government ah no
(15:30) why because the small government usually is mediocre and you need to have X amount
(15:36) of diplomats you need to have X amount of Statesmen you have to represent 300 million people in this particular case I
(15:42) would actually Advocate that you have far more congressmen that way you didn't have an electoral state which was as
(15:47) messed up as ours is so that's what I mean that's what I would do I would actually expand the
(15:53) electorate because you know having only two senators for states were probably not a great idea just so you know and
(16:00) alimony your thoughts on that uh I think that in some rare instances
(16:06) that that can be adjudicated and has been traditionally adjudicated by the church if alimony is necessary
(16:13) the church yeah I don't see why the state needs to become involved in a religious ceremony
(16:20) can you give me a reason why secularists need to get married any of you like why
(16:25) is that good I understand because they love each other I mean you can love each other without marriage it's a religious
(16:30) it's a religious okay but you might have a tradition in your family like you
(16:35) would want to get married you mean that came from the religious people in your family
(16:41) you want to take the institution of marriage and make it like completely
(16:46) separate from the legal institution so you would get no tax benefits for being
(16:51) a married couple you don't need yeah so just to address these one at a time right you don't need to be married in
(16:59) order to address tax benefits for couples you recognize this right Lauren I'm I'm asking if you I'm asking again
(17:07) I just answered your question you don't actually you don't need to be married
(17:13) for tax benefits because you can address the tax system separate from Marriage it's ridiculous so you think that's the
(17:18) only so Oh you mean changing it so he's saying
(17:24) that the only reason that the government is involved in marriage at all is to monitor taxes and then taxes could be
(17:30) monitored I didn't say that at all you just draw man I'm trying to understand she's asking you a question and I just
(17:37) answered another question and then she straw manned the position if you want another position just ask
(17:42) and I'll give it to you she was literally just doing that like show the phone no she like literally like wasn't drunky she literally didn't I wasn't so
(17:51) anyway back to what you were asking me Lauren just to just give you the answer to the question let me let me rephrase
(17:58) the question if you don't mind how is the government and marriage currently
(18:03) intertwined as well so right now they're the adjudicators so at the moment you have
(18:09) to go to the state in order to become licensed and you also have to go to the state in order to get the license revoked so essentially they're they they
(18:17) operate as a middleman adjudication system between uh the partnership and
(18:22) the marriage so I think that that can be done by the church and it doesn't need to be done by the state at all it's not
(18:28) it's never been necessary nor is that something which is traditional that is not a problem so if you separated it
(18:35) right so if you've separated this into like a a religious ceremony and you have
(18:40) the states not involved in marriages at all however the state would still
(18:46) monitor couples for the purposes of Taxation so would they what would that
(18:52) look like and could cover same thing it looks like right now
(18:58) it's no longer for the Dignity of family there's like in uh legal precedent a lot
(19:04) of marriage issues have to do with the Dignity of families and creating the better the best Society possible for a
(19:09) long time encouraging birth rates et cetera et cetera yeah I agree you're just going to interrupt me every time I talk and then complain if I interrupt
(19:15) you okay well give me the signal when you're done because it sounds like you're winding down so when I'm not talking
(19:21) that's when I'm talking about let's see if that ever happens but go ahead I can I can see why you complain about uh no
(19:28) fault divorces I could see you wanting to grasp onto your wife as best as you can I could see this you're probably
(19:34) running oh great that what a what a swell argument are you gonna get to an argument because I'm still waiting for one dude I lost my I'm sure you did go
(19:42) ahead say what you were gonna say because you wanted to interrupt me so much well wait a second wait a second you're saying that just a minor
(19:48) Interruption you derailed your entire train of thoughts same thing right now just get to your points both of you guys to your point
(19:55) Andrew my point is is that you don't need to have the state involved in marriage at all okay so so how is that
(20:02) system gonna work so now the state is not involved in marriages but however you say the state is still involved in
(20:09) couples being taxed differently than single people so then couples will also
(20:15) want to be triples for tax purposes maybe business partners um and then also maybe father and
(20:21) daughter maybe would want for tax purposes to live together so will that be allowed by the state does this change
(20:27) things because it's no longer a sexual family Dynamic monitor so I'm curious is
(20:33) how this is now going to work in your new Society so here I'll answer okay sorry go ahead
(20:41) I thought you were doing talking my bad go ahead you got the floor I'll let you answer that okay so first of all all
(20:48) you're talking about here is changing one position which is that the government itself no longer issues
(20:54) marriage licenses they don't need to do it for the purposes of Taxation they still are going to track who's cohabitating they've always tracked
(21:01) who's cohabitating we have the U.S census which is great at doing this you have social security numbers for your
(21:07) job and if you want to have tax benefits and tax breaks and things like that you could maybe engage in what's called a civil union there's states which have
(21:13) had those for an awful long time and you can do that that's how homosexuals used to be able to get married is through a
(21:20) civil union they would get all of the same protections of a marriage without it being the actual sacrament of
(21:25) marriage and then if you want to have no fault divorce for your secular marriages fine but I think that that you should
(21:33) probably push for some kind of Sacrament or some kind
(21:38) of value to marriage if you want people to remain married I can demonstrate this by the fact that religious people get
(21:43) divorced less yet they seem to be healthier in their marriages do you know the legal distinctions between us
(21:49) marriage I couldn't hear you say that again do you know the legal distinctions between
(21:56) a civil union and a marriage depends on the state okay but for instance when a spouse dies
(22:04) at a civil union do they receive the uh the estate or part of the estate
(22:10) especially the Homestead State like Florida I mean let's assume for a second none of them could you as the secularist
(22:16) who introduced civil unions instead of marriage could easily ratify that for
(22:21) whatever secular framework that you wanted so whatever non-religious framework that you wanted to add in and
(22:26) call it a civil union another than religious Union you could add in whatever the hell you wanted so this is
(22:32) essentially marriage but with a different terminology whatever you want
(22:37) to call it we wouldn't recognize it as marriage why don't churches just have their own
(22:44) ceremony that they don't recognize the state they do recognize that ceremony don't Catholics not recognize the state
(22:52) divorce anyway
(22:57) the state itself does not recognize religious marriage by itself so the
(23:03) state itself still has to issue a license and you are still subject to the state for the purposes of you being able
(23:09) to get divorced you understand the distinction there there's a huge distinction yeah because
(23:16) if you're Catholic the priest still won't sanctify your divorce so you won't be considered divorced and I know this
(23:22) because my dad's Catholic and my there was issue on my with my grandma with divorce whatever and their Catholics are
(23:29) really weird about that stuff I agree so yeah so even her partner want
(23:36) grandma he couldn't he had to wait for her to die in order to marry my grandma even though she was legally divorced
(23:42) because the church wouldn't recognize the church your dream world already exists no it doesn't so first of all the
(23:50) Catholic the church has no the Catholic Church of marriage then the state you're
(23:55) missing the point of course but the church did it you're missing the point the enforcement arms not the church the
(24:01) enforcement arm is still the state so he he still had to go stop and let me finish he still had to go and get
(24:08) divorced by the state right I mean
(24:13) I mean it's just religious answer my question did he have to go to the state divorced
(24:20) if he I mean no because he had to wait for his wife to die right where you just got them saying that he got divorced but
(24:26) he couldn't still leave the marriage because the Catholic Church wouldn't let him right right so now you're asking okay so then he did have to go to the
(24:33) state and the state did have to give him a divorce he had to wait for his wife to
(24:38) die because he was adhering to his religious institution but he still had to go to
(24:44) the state Lauren to get a divorce Lauren you just said he did he wanted to separate the state the state ties of his
(24:53) marriage which is what the state would be regulating in this civil union system that you're setting up anyway well the
(24:59) state wouldn't be regulating anything with with religious marriage why would they be ready so now you want the church
(25:05) to dictate the separation which would be the cause of yeah
(25:11) if you're going to do a Sacramento I'm answering your question yes the
(25:17) answer is yes I want the church to adjudicate that have you heard of the separate
(25:23) this would separate the church and state what are you talking about well I think we're gonna getting going in circles a
(25:29) little bit here I just want to try and keep us back on track so I guess I I'm honestly cutting anyone off here but
(25:35) like Andrew like if you can already get married via the church without being
(25:41) legally binding currently then what are you complaining about why did you get
(25:46) married for a legal purpose which I assume you did I'm not
(25:53) show your particular situation like if you're saying that you could just do a ceremony with the church right that's
(25:58) what you're wanting yes no current currently priests cannot marry you without the state well I mean
(26:04) but it would be like you you could have that within like your religious practice it just wouldn't be legally binding correct no you well you really can't
(26:11) have that because but that's what you want yes yes there's laws that make that illegal so usually a priest or make it
(26:18) illegal a priest yes a priest often in most in Most states I think actually has
(26:23) to uh have the authority of the state and issue you a marriage license in order to marry you I
(26:29) bigamy laws no I'm not talking about bigamy laws well I just don't understand why you
(26:35) can't just have that done what law are you referring to because I've never heard of a law that a religious ceremony
(26:41) couldn't take place without the state's permission so you can make you can make that but
(26:47) it's not a recognized marriage the state should still happening
(26:54) stop the state should still have to recognize the marriage that doesn't mean that they have the authority to
(26:59) adjudicate it stop proving I'm making bad points no
(27:11) give me a um my argument let me let me frame it the
(27:17) best way to possibly can damn it is I'm trying that's why I'll try to frame it as best I can the state does not need to
(27:23) adjudicate religious marriage however the state should have to recognize religious what does that mean it means
(27:30) that the state is going to have to recognize that you're married by the church and and recognize the church's
(27:35) authority to be the adjudicator over the divorce portion okay but what does that mean just
(27:41) explain stupid are you like I just literally explained it really didn't explain that at all how much more can
(27:47) explain this question yeah like you're talking about like the last name acknowledge just keep
(27:54) answering the same question benefits like what are we you did not answer that question at all okay so as far as it
(28:00) comes to what tax benefits things like this yeah is that what you mean when you say recognize yeah whatever whatever the the
(28:07) benefits are that the state's going to offer up or whatever yes it needs to be recognized marriage involved in
(28:13) adjudication of state issues and well it's not it's not just the State issue
(28:19) the state the state is a composition of people sure it's fun exactly the states a composition of people Lauren okay so
(28:27) people should be able to be allowed to have their own adjudicators separate of the state and they traditionally always
(28:33) have so I don't know what you're talking about I always have since what time
(28:38) period throughout most of History the church has been the Dominion United States the
(28:45) church has been the dominion over divorce throughout most of human history these are religious sacraments these are
(28:52) not secularists sacraments that only began during the Enlightenment period
(28:57) when they really started to push through laws when it came to divorce in order to promote the Health and Welfare of the
(29:03) individuals inside of these nations but the community United States did this happen I don't know what the exact dates
(29:10) were never yeah no listen did the United States
(29:15) change from no fault divorce that happened but that's completely different than it okay so hang on before
(29:22) then there if you're if you're going backwards it's ridiculous for you to expect me to know the exact date that
(29:29) this change shifted drastically so yes it has happened I just told you traditionally the church has always been
(29:36) the adjudicator married and who got divorced yes who do you who do you think
(29:42) founded the United States Lauren who do you think founded it who got here first like in what sense
(29:51) um
(29:58) the United States the United States had the United States had Puritans Lauren
(30:04) the United States had Puritans who got here Puritan Christians okay they were not appealing to the state because the
(30:10) church was the state okay they were the state they put up the Constitution
(30:16) States no that came later oh okay so it's not the so the United States never right had the church
(30:23) adjudicating you mean the same United States that claims all men are created are created equal doesn't say anything
(30:29) about women being created equal didn't allow women to have suffrage didn't allow women to have any of those things didn't allow women to vote because they
(30:36) weren't stakeholders also gave them made sure that they had limited access to property are these all feminists aren't
(30:42) just all feminist prop uh propaganda what a pivot overall argument what you're asking me
(30:49) to give you a Precision date for some I don't know that off the top of mind never happened
(30:56) tell me what never happened let's make sure there's never a period in United
(31:01) States history when the church was adjudicating marriages for the purposes of Taxation or any other legal benefits
(31:08) well no that's not true the entire 17 hang on the entire 1700s the state had
(31:14) limited involvement in marriage what are you talking about them is Protestant sex there wasn't hardly
(31:22) any taxes in the 1700s Lauren I'm sorry do you know what the
(31:27) Revolutionary War was paid or it was done over what are you talking about oh my God how dumb are you what does it
(31:34) have to do with anything well I'm asking you do you do you know why the Revolutionary War was started I know
(31:40) what that what the propagandist said in the Revolutionary War the United States
(31:45) I think that the I think that the war well regardless of why I think the war was fought that really has no bearing or
(31:51) Merit on any of this no taxation without representation that was propaganda that
(31:57) was Patriot propaganda it was patriotic exactly didn't mean it didn't happen you understand propaganda doesn't mean that
(32:02) it's a lie oh great well now we have tons of Taxation with representation was it like the whole tea party thing
(32:09) about me being taxed too much so you're telling us there's no taxes in this
(32:14) entire [ __ ] country was found I didn't say that I just said there wasn't very many taxes and I got to tell you
(32:20) that yeah the entire reason was because there was too many taxes the purpose of Merit no
(32:26) that wasn't the entire reason for the Revolutionary War that's insane you're talking about the Boston Tea Party and you're talking about Patriot propaganda
(32:33) which happened the Patriot propaganda okay was necessary for the war effort okay I support my country good for you
(32:41) appreciate your [ __ ] here oh
(32:49) I just want to say that I like me that's unfortunate I'm even wearing a conservative shirt
(32:55) damn all right let's let's redirect no let's not redirect I'm not done yet I
(33:01) want to know I would like to know when do you guys think the income tax started okay one question I want to redirect
(33:07) back to this yeah when do you think it started uh I forgot the amendment it's okay for you to not know anything
(33:14) right yeah go ahead Google it uh 17 women was it the 17th amendment when did
(33:21) the income tax start 18. what was it
(33:27) 1861 um no Civil War prompted the first American Income Tax in 1861. yeah okay
(33:33) that was for the war effort but the actual income tax that you have now right that started in the 1900s just so
(33:39) you understand the 1900s so now as you so now as you move so now
(33:45) as you move back yeah so I want to redirect back to the
(33:50) initial topic we covered history quite enough it's not related at all to the yes it is related
(33:55) because we're talking about the history of marriage Alex how's that related to the idea of uh
(34:02) divorced horses because because in this because in this
(34:07) particular because in this particular case what they're trying to say is that I have some kind of incoherent system
(34:12) and yet I'm saying no it's actually your system which is incoherent which is leading to the maximum amount of
(34:17) divorces which we're having at the moment right because specifically because specifically no fault divorce so
(34:25) if you're looking at it you know divorce rates are falling let me finish calm down Lauren so again again when you
(34:33) when you're looking at this no fault divorce is a primary cause for why it is that women Institute so this is what the
(34:40) question is right why do women uh have or Institute so many divorces why are
(34:45) they petitioning so much for divorce things like this it's actually really simple because there's very limited penalty at all for women to go and uh
(34:55) petition the court for a divorce they almost always win and they almost always uh get more assets this has been what
(35:02) has traditionally happened since no fault divorce was instituted they usually get the kids they usually get
(35:07) the house it's a pretty bad deal for men it's a big problem that's why we got into all these other things okay let's
(35:14) just try to keep it on track with it you want to talk about the history of divorce or whatever that's fine let's not get into like [ __ ] income taxes
(35:19) and whatnot and like why the why the revolution happen like that's not really quite related you know fun fact U.S divorce rates hit
(35:27) an all-time 50-year low isn't that a fun fact because almost
(35:32) nobody's getting married that's why so that's what you want you don't want
(35:38) the secret of people getting married people are no but you literally just
(35:43) said you didn't want the secretary getting married so maybe those are the people who are not getting married right so what I want to do is shift
(35:50) people to get married so so here's what you are seeing though
(35:57) you are seeing religious people stay married longer they're happier longer the more religious they are the less
(36:04) likely they are to be divorced the less likely a woman is to Institute a divorce all those great things that's why I want
(36:11) to see more people move towards religion as a grounding for why they get married in the first place is a Sacrament so
(36:16) they take it seriously instead of secularists who make vows and then go but I didn't like Johnny anymore because
(36:22) Johnny got fat so I decided to go bang the neighbor right and then they go well there's no fault divorce there's very
(36:28) little penalty for them and so they Institute a divorce they they push the divorce men and women cheat at the same
(36:34) rates generally so I don't really understand what that's going with but um do you really think that like you
(36:41) should just not ever have any reason to leave or like is it the do you actually believe in The Fault divorces are you
(36:49) just saying that to be like annoying about it or do you believe that nobody should ever be divorced I don't know what your
(36:55) position is on this you think Stephen Crowders why I should have been allowed to divorce him great question
(37:00) if if you have a show cause for abuse actual physical abuse or you have a show
(37:07) cause for infidelity or abandonment right I think that those
(37:13) are all good causes when you're talking about things like emotional abuse try to remember what your vows are through
(37:19) better through worse sometimes in marriage you're going to have years not months not weeks but years that might be
(37:27) really rough they might be hard marriage is really hard people shouldn't enter into your marriage they shouldn't enter
(37:33) into marriage unless they're prepared for all those hard times I don't disagree that marriage is hard it's scary I I understand like
(37:40) um that aspect of it but like if somebody is abusing you and you have kids like
(37:47) even if it's emotionally why do you think that they wouldn't abuse your children and on second uh question I'll let you
(37:56) finish let me just finish my question real quick um
(38:02) would you think that it is okay to leave a marriage if your partner whether it is
(38:09) you know man wife whatever um is abusing your kids do you think that's
(38:16) fair to leave that marriage or or more than anything I would even think like maybe it's like your duty that you should for the good of your
(38:22) children if your partner is abusing your children should you be able to leave them
(38:29) is that what you're asking I visit you partner basically saying like if somebody is going to we'll just do one
(38:34) party you okay that's fair um we'll start with the first part if somebody is going to abuse you like
(38:41) um emotionally or physically why physically do you think that they wouldn't
(38:48) do you think that they're not going well I need to clarify okay would you not
(38:54) think that they would do that to your children if if you have a spouse who's physically abusive I think physically or
(39:00) emotionally well the problem with emotional abuse is that it's highly subjective and I don't know exactly what
(39:06) it means so I know what physical abuse means and I think that all of us would agree with what physical abuse is what
(39:11) do you think like gaslighting would be like uh okay I think all of us would agree what
(39:16) physical abuse is I think all of us would agree what infidelity is I think all of us would agree what abandonment
(39:21) is not sure all of us would agree on what emotional abuse is okay well I I guess I'll like try and
(39:29) clarify then um it's something like somebody's gaslighting you constantly or like I
(39:34) mean like you saw the Stephen Crowder stuff right yeah like do you think that what he was
(39:39) doing to her was not emotionally abusive maybe so what
(39:44) well how is that what do you mean so why so what if his if the kids are witnessing that throughout like a
(39:50) 10-year marriage anything that will affect the way that that's different so now you're so now that's what we're asking so now you're asking about some
(39:56) elongated pattern of behavior that's like never ending or something like this rather than an isolated incident so
(40:03) here's what I'll say right as as you guys kind of giggle and scoff which I find amusing
(40:09) um all of you every single one of you have been have been mean to a man right
(40:16) or have had men be mean to you every single one of you have had engagements with men especially your you know
(40:22) whoever you're dating or something like this where the guy's been a [ __ ] or you've been a [ __ ] to the guy but
(40:29) that didn't mean that you broke up the relationship over that the marriage is something that's much or should be much
(40:35) more difficult to break up than just some relationship you have with a boyfriend
(40:42) let me finish let me finish turn it over I promise but emotionally if you're
(40:48) talking about emotional abuse I think that that's really difficult for us to agree on what that's going to be because
(40:54) I think a person could maybe even emotionally abuse you for three or four years and then stop doing it marriages
(41:01) work or whatever you consider to be emotional abuse or you them marriages work relationships are work relationship
(41:07) Dynamics or work now let me ask you this before you guys ask me another question who here besides me is married raise
(41:14) your hand oh wow you've researched us okay you're married Angela
(41:20) yeah are you lying to Angela just curious
(41:26) uh why would I lie what what I came from lying I don't know I'm just curious
(41:32) I gotta like my green card leave me alone yes I am married
(41:39) and you're not going through a divorce uh no why would no I I like to stay in
(41:44) America so no I'm not going through I don't know you just raise your hand really slow it was weird just saying well I didn't know there was like a
(41:49) follow through question and I was like all right what's going on well I'm just saying like before you guys are so quick
(41:54) to say anything about what's emotional abuse or what isn't maybe you're married to know which one
(42:02) with what we're talking about is like I understand what you're saying but if you've been if you're married and maybe
(42:07) maybe you're comparing it to like a modern marriage when people get married but then like the first two years of meeting but like if you've been with someone long enough and and you're
(42:13) saying that this Behavior will slowly go away if the behavior goes away whether somebody is just ignoring the situation
(42:19) it's only going to get worse but I don't see how a guy can be emotionally abusive and then just slowly not be emotionally abusive anymore I I don't see like how
(42:25) like I've if you're in a relationship with somebody what's emotional so let's start with this and if it's going to be
(42:31) pedantic tell me what you think emotional abuse is uh she gave an example of gaslighting
(42:37) um deprive I would say depriving of funds I would say
(42:42) um why is depriving of funds emotional abuse so for instance I know somebody who her husband would go out on trips I
(42:49) don't care about anecdote I care about the argument why we're depriving somebody anecdotes are not an argument
(42:55) give me an argument an argument it's an example you asked for an example you didn't ask I asked specifically for an
(43:01) argument so what I want to know the way that I was going to answer and I want what I want to know specifically is
(43:07) an argument for why it is that deprivation of funds is emotional abuse okay I'm going to
(43:13) give you an example of course of how deprivation of funds is emotional abuse I know someone whose husband would go on
(43:20) trips and even though they had a newborn baby and she was in college he would cut off their credit card when
(43:28) he would go on trips and he wouldn't tell her how long and sometimes it would
(43:34) be days sometimes it'd be months she would not know and so she would just have to survive on
(43:41) the food in her clothes like food that she had in her pantry eventually she would have to go to her mom and ask for
(43:47) food it was emotionally abusive okay well I know a couple and what they do is
(43:54) he deprives her of money because he thinks that she spins hang on no you
(43:59) hold on I just went through your whole life yes
(44:04) I'm giving you a counter example of how it doesn't so I know everybody in the exact same type of situation the exact
(44:10) same type of way just the opposite is true refute it okay if you give me a refutation
(44:16) so the deprivation of funds and whatever my anecdotal scenario is is good there
(44:21) we go give me I don't understand the exactly I know you don't understand
(44:27) he's doing a deprivation of funds and it's actually good because it works for their marriage instead of she doesn't
(44:33) like it I guess you know whatever the answer is what is your anecdote I'm actually curious so the anecdote would
(44:39) be that she spent too much she spends too much money because she spends too much money cut off the credit card
(44:44) payment so he deprives her funds that's good and healthy for the couple I've known couples where this has happened to
(44:49) them here's an anecdote for you there you go repeat it that's probably not yeah well then
(44:56) that's probably not a uh if it's something that like she has an issue and no it's actually emotional abuse to him
(45:01) huh how dare she make it so that that poor guy has to freeze her credit cards she'd love he'd love to share the money
(45:07) with her you might be here too that's fine but that doesn't that doesn't discount what her argument was and what
(45:13) what's your argument was an anecdote it's an example
(45:20) geometry Andrew those things are not mutually exclusive
(45:25) what I'm wondering what you know what you took basically what the [ __ ] does that have to do with it
(45:30) it's a tea party geometry is here I struggle with logic
(45:37) structures because of geometry well not because it's not geometry's fault okay Lauren let me ask you a
(45:43) question there's three laws of logic can you name them for me but you mean three laws of law so are
(45:50) you saying like for instance um if a then B yeah the Three Laws three
(45:56) laws of logic there's only three can you name even one of them yeah it's like if
(46:04) if oh I don't remember like you would you would have to know this maybe you should have stayed in Geometry I guess
(46:11) identity and non-condition excluded metal like I mean should have stayed in Geometry you lose how dumb that you make
(46:18) yourself look Andrew yeah I made myself look down that's for sure usually Google like you're really gonna think like it
(46:24) makes her look stupid that you're just like hey name like like you're basically doing the same logical argument of like
(46:30) the uh that she did oh yeah game three songs from the band like it's
(46:35) like we could just look it up so she asked me
(46:41) ask me so she asked me would you what did you fail what did you fail geometry freeological argumentation
(46:47) structure so yeah I got a perfect score in Geometry I went on
(46:54) and then I went on to be a math major what does geometry have to do with the logical structure Lauren there's a lot
(47:01) of an argument that you seem to be failing so for instance when I gave the anecdotal example of how it is
(47:07) can be and this is actually one of the logic structures you were just talking about so maybe you know them off the top
(47:13) of your head but you don't know how to apply them which seems to be an issue for you if I give an example geometry a
(47:19) reservation of funds can be abused you giving an example of how deprivations of funds could not be abused is not
(47:26) discrediting the fact that my example was still right both are both are non-sequiturs Lauren
(47:33) yeah they're both non-sequiturs going back to your annual arguments how to cut
(47:38) off the funds like off of your example for someone who's married is that is that what you would do for your marriage if somebody was spending if your wife
(47:44) was spending too much money just to cut off the funds just to like teach her a lesson but what would you do well it's
(47:49) not teaching a lesson but I have two children she has children with me I think that it's very important that if
(47:54) somebody if one of the partners is being irresponsible with money uh that it's a duty to in fact to cut off funding so
(48:02) that they're not no longer irresponsible with money and I think that oftentimes especially if you look at consumer
(48:08) spending women are responsible for upwards of 70 to 80 percent of all consumer spending they spend a lot of
(48:14) money so the thing is is that oftentimes it's a misleading spot because women
(48:19) spend money on a lot of things like household stuff and everything I agree listen I agree what I'm saying to you
(48:25) though is that generally speaking they spend a lot of money so you're going to
(48:30) often find that when Financial disputes come up inside of marriages it's not usually the man who's overspending they
(48:37) do don't get me wrong it happens but oftentimes as a woman who's overspending and so it falls under the duty and
(48:43) purview of the man to say no you can't overspend and if he's the breadwinner and he's the provider for the family why
(48:50) would be problematic for him to say that this money needs to be used in a way I deem responsible for the family
(48:59) right but I wanted to so you're saying basically to cut it off but wouldn't that be a red flag as to why she
(49:04) randomly started to aggressively spend on this money because if someone who's married and their personality drastically changes wouldn't that be a
(49:11) reason to find the root of why instead of just saying I'm going to cut this off and starting the beginning of why relationship fails because of the lack of communication
(49:18) yeah so so I think you're conflating two different things so if you're asking me do you think that we should get to the
(49:24) root of the problem of why the woman is spending so much money I would say sure but that really doesn't negate the point
(49:29) that if she is spending too much money and the dude puts a freeze on the money that he seems to be justified in doing
(49:35) so I think it's Justified because you're not necessarily strong
(49:42) and is what I'm saying Angeles both and so you can put a stop on it while you get to the root of the problem
(49:48) but I was going off of your example and it just seemed like you didn't really my example my my example is both and you
(49:55) can do both things at one time you don't have to do one or the other you can do both and then you can do the other thing as well so again marriages work if
(50:01) you're going to be working on your marriage you have to freeze the funds obviously you're going to be working with your wife on why it is that she
(50:07) needs to be spending this money in the correct manner of this type of thing I think that's totally reasonable the fact that depriving funds can maybe not
(50:15) always but can be a form of emotional abuse and you asked what other forms of
(50:20) emotional views are there other than gaslighting I gave an example of how depriving funds can be emotional abuse
(50:27) and so now I'm asking you're saying that only the church should be allowed to determine whether or not that's
(50:32) emotional abuse and that shouldn't be adjudicated by the court and holding out can holding out on sex be emotional
(50:37) abuse yes yeah yeah okay so can basically everything be emotional abuse just
(50:43) depending on the subjective interpretation of one partner isn't that really what's true that
(50:48) everything under the sun could be why court systems and part of legislation
(50:54) when they decided to make no fault divorce available was because so much of this court system was wrapped up in
(51:00) determining these subjective arguments if he said she said in the first place well no not just that but there was also
(51:06) a push from a feminist arm in the United States especially under the Reagan Administration yes I've read you should
(51:12) also read a book called occult feminism my wife and it'll go over all of this
(51:17) just so you know and yes that was a Shameless plug sponsored
(51:22) read the Justified fictions that legislate
(51:30) legislative divorces in their state and why other legislators in their various states have still kept some sort of uh
(51:38) at fault divorce available for those who want it Covenant marriages those justification for no fault divorce
(51:45) is not even recent so there you'll find justifications throughout feminist literature going back all the way to the
(51:52) early listen I'm answering your question no you're not yes I am let me finish
(51:57) you'll find justification literature going back all the way to the 1800s for
(52:02) an attempt to push no fault divorce or being able to get divorced for no reason
(52:08) at all because you want to it's part of the women's Liberation movement they've been pushing for this forever under
(52:15) Reagan there was all sorts of different justifications which were pushed for it but here's the thing Reagan started in
(52:21) California by doing this and then he made it nationwide it was a huge mistake how did civilization survive Lauren pree
(52:28) Reagan instituting no-fault divorce how how I mean why didn't everything just
(52:33) blow up okay so I love how you pivot from answering what you didn't give me
(52:39) another question but I'm just going to repeat my question like the most thorough way I could have answered it what the legislators wrote which
(52:47) there's various legislators yeah give me one name you don't know one name you ask me a
(52:53) question management so under the footnotes of
(52:59) give me one name well I just just let her answer the question I just answer mine give me a name and then I can
(53:05) answer the question
(53:12) which uh Supreme Court Justice wrote that I couldn't give you the name I've read loving the Virginia I couldn't give
(53:18) you the name of this do you know this right have I read the justifications of the people whose names you don't know
(53:24) this is Big Brain stuff under the footnotes of all of these laws for instance the creation of the Covenant
(53:31) law you could look up why the legislator wrote that into the law and they give their rationale and I'm asking that's
(53:37) nice of them no I haven't read everything uh that everybody's ever written Lauren yes yeah then why are you
(53:43) expecting her to have done that like because she because if she if she applies the standard to me of have you
(53:50) read X but she can't even tell me the person whose name I should know it doesn't matter
(53:57) you have to know every little aspect if you asked me a question if you asked
(54:03) me question X Nina Nina if you ask me a question this person has said
(54:10) person's name and you say I don't know your credibility goes to zero no that's
(54:15) because people forget
(54:21) that I don't know the author's name I haven't read a lot of things without knowing the author's name I'd be curious
(54:27) how much you've read in your life which appears to be books
(54:35) for you my guy you don't know the name either like I don't know like I will Google it for you what was your question
(54:40) when that you were getting all pissed off and like trying to Pivot and distract from um uh her line of thought
(54:47) to answer yeah you don't remember the questions I was looking up something else by all
(54:54) means okay so the legislators who wrote
(55:00) uh Georgia does Georgia have Covenant divorces okay
(55:05) I I don't know the the various States in which have Covenant divorces they typically write A Treatise as to why
(55:12) they wrote why they created a covenant divorce or why they got rid or why they
(55:17) changed the legislation I'm wondering if you've read any of these treatises no
(55:23) okay so you don't know any of the legislators justifications for getting rid of at fault divorces I'm well no
(55:30) that's not what I said there's more to a legislation process Than A Treatise so
(55:36) there's all sorts of political justifications which are done in the National and localized level by several
(55:41) different authors oftentimes legislation like this is not even drafted by the person who writes it it's drafted by
(55:47) external parties Lauren so no I may have read quite a bit on it but that doesn't mean I've read an example of A Treatise
(55:53) directly so okay if you've read quite a bit on it can you please give us some of the reasons and why these legislators
(56:00) chose to get rid of Apple divorces where and which legislature let's just say
(56:06) um New York okay and which legislature under who who introduced the legislation
(56:13) any any I'm asking you why and I'm just asking you to give me the answer so that
(56:18) I can answer your question I don't you don't know specific legislature don't ask me questions
(56:25) Lauren stop asking stupid questions definitely comes off like you you know what you're
(56:30) talking about you're not just kidding you're definitely under I'm asking you a broad question and I get it you're
(56:36) asking me to pin it down to a specific person I'm asking you what is the ratchet now legislators gave for getting
(56:44) rid of at fault where and which legislature why not New York
(56:49) okay literally you're saying that you've read some of
(56:55) these decisions and it's a more broad thing it's more General and there's these public it wasn't just are you
(57:01) asking me if I know so I just want to make sure I get this right if you're asking me Andrew do you know a specific
(57:07) legislative body in New York in their justifications inside of New York for why they did X thing the answer to this
(57:14) particular question is no what's your point any rationale that these that
(57:19) these legislators gave for any legislator in any jurisdiction gave for
(57:25) changing the law to no fault divorce sorry to at fault divorce and new fault
(57:31) divorce yes I can give you what the Reagan administrative or Reagan administration said [ __ ] difficult
(57:36) for you okay because well next time next time just be either precise with your questions
(57:42) I'm gonna do this whole thing just just let's just stay and focus so go ahead enter anyway yeah so the Reagan
(57:47) Administration they they push this in California and much of the justification for it came from literally the liberal
(57:55) arts section of California liberal universities and what they were pushing
(58:00) at the time was that women were subject to all sorts of different types of abuses and that the patriarchal system
(58:08) that's in which they were living under were oppressive to them and this was a
(58:13) huge push in California and as they say as goes California so goes the rest of
(58:18) the United States so yes those were many of the justifications which were given at the time uh for why it was that we
(58:25) needed no fault divorce but there's other far more specific examples going even further back in history as
(58:32) feminists have been pushing this for a long time all right I'm gonna give a five minute
(58:37) warning before we move on to the next topic uh because we've been going about for an hour so just a heads up for everybody
(58:42) and so these legislators didn't base this idea that women were suffering or
(58:48) um maybe an abnormal amount of abuse compared to men in these divorce in these inabilities to have no fault
(58:55) divorces justifications yeah
(59:02) their justifications were good it just means they offered them up as justification and you don't think women
(59:07) going through abuses is a good justification I don't think that the justifications which are offered for y
(59:14) should be no fault if you're going through abuses is Justified no do you also now Lauren let me ask you the same
(59:20) question back have you read any of the counter arguments to any of these justifications yeah usually when you
(59:26) read that give me one yeah is that it will increase divorce it will
(59:32) um
(59:39) so there was there was Bennett the issue that was at hand which was women being
(59:45) in abusive relationships and not being able to gather the evidence and be able to afford an attorney without their
(59:51) husband finding out completely their husbands monitored finances so these women were stuck in
(59:57) these abusive relationships so in California
(1:00:05) but Lauren in California who wrote that counter argument oh my God I don't care honestly Andrew I I think you have to
(1:00:11) approve why is um people who are unhappy and married why is that ridiculous
(1:00:23) show it to me oh my gosh you just seem to have maybe read like five things in your life okay
(1:00:29) wait wait okay hold on we only have a little bit of time can you show it to me I wanna I wanna ask Andrew why is
(1:00:35) divorce inherently bad for you that it like if it's going through a bunch of abuses why do you think that it
(1:00:41) shouldn't be fair for somebody to leave because your primary the primary Edict of a marriage is not about you and it's
(1:00:47) not about your spouse it's about your children okay so if somebody continue continuously keeping keeping continuity
(1:00:54) inside of your family is the most important thing that you can do the outcomes for children and you're all
(1:00:59) consequentialists I'm sure the outcomes for children are almost always better if
(1:01:05) they stay inside of your household let me give you an example of how bad this is Nina let's say that you have children
(1:01:10) in a house filled to the brim with abuse and you remove the children and hand them over to the state they're a hundred
(1:01:15) times more likely to be abused by the state than they would have been inside of their abusive home great that's
(1:01:20) actually a fantastic argument for divorce then they should stay with the parent that is not abusing them correct
(1:01:26) X for physical abuse I've never disputed this okay so then you should support divorce
(1:01:32) no that's not well under the pretense of physical abuse I've already said that that's a Justified reason for divorce
(1:01:39) Nina okay is there any lines who are emotional abuse and now it's a call-in
(1:01:44) question so I think that the church is far better at adjudicating this than the state is
(1:01:51) honestly not bad at like abused I love this stuff
(1:01:56) the state is famously not bad come on Nina the state is awful when it comes to
(1:02:02) adjudication yeah absolutely let me explain the rational numbers
(1:02:10) I wouldn't trust Catholic church but let me explain the rationale so that you understand I'm gonna explain the
(1:02:16) rationale for for why it is that the church would be better at adjudicating this in the state the church would be
(1:02:22) better because you're part of the church yes you're part of the church's congregation they know you your priest
(1:02:27) knows you this is a community which knows you they are they have intricate knowledge of your intricate details
(1:02:33) whereas a judge and especially a state judge or a state appointed judge they know very little about you very little
(1:02:40) exactly very little they're not impartial if they were impartial women
(1:02:45) everything in divorces
(1:02:50) you are so afraid of your wife living here I think it's very hilarious uh so once again first of all you can't have
(1:02:58) this church adjudicate things that aren't intervalented with the state because you can't have the church
(1:03:04) adjudicate like that's just it's just unconstitutional I'm sorry and then and you seem to care about the Constitution
(1:03:10) I think you do not I don't know I can't really tell with you um is there any line for emotional abuse
(1:03:16) is there a line because you consider emotional abuse can be anything at any
(1:03:22) time and dependent upon subjective question actually it's not a yes or no
(1:03:27) question yeah how long have you been a [ __ ] yes or no
(1:03:33) question it's a yes or no question I I've just
(1:03:38) passed the bar and I I went to law school so like yes or no that's not yes or no Lauren that's not yes I know how
(1:03:45) long I've been a [ __ ] but back to answering your questions emotional abuse yeah so so I'm gonna
(1:03:52) answer this question okay there actually can't be a line because you set it up so
(1:03:59) and stated that this is subjective and everything could be considered emotional abuse everything so it's up to
(1:04:06) subjective interpretation so how could I delineate a line so my my example of my my friend being
(1:04:13) deprived Financial assets that wasn't emotion that wasn't abuse yeah but I
(1:04:20) mean interpreted which way I think from the man's perspective it's abusive that she overspends she she didn't over she
(1:04:26) didn't well in the case of your anecdote all I have to do is offer up a counter anecdote where it was good and then
(1:04:32) suddenly it's not emotional abuse because it's a subjective interpretation
(1:04:39) the way that you're thinking is very conscient in like all actions are equivalent no matter the circumstances
(1:04:45) I'm a deontologist so that doesn't surprise me uh so all actions are the same no matter
(1:04:51) the situation so for instance deprivation of funds is the same whether that be depriving a woman from food and
(1:05:00) depriving her baby from being fed and that's the same as depriving a woman who just spent that's not what happened in
(1:05:06) your all your life savings on fur coats that is not what you said in your example that if their baby was not being
(1:05:12) fed yes I did I literally did say that I did so you're saying in this case that
(1:05:18) the man is being physically abusive to the child because depriving the child of resources which are necessary to life
(1:05:24) that's different than emotional abuse Lauren she is depriving her of funds so if you consider depriving her funds
(1:05:30) physical abuse it now only in certain circumstances where depriving of the funds would stop the child from being
(1:05:37) fed that's a whole different situation I mean I guess my friend could have technically robbed a grocery store and
(1:05:44) then she wouldn't have deprived the baby from being fed so technically it's not his right according to you it's not
(1:05:50) emotional abuse you could just get it that would be physical abuse you have a dude it's an ethical duty to feed your
(1:05:58) children and if you deprive your children of having food that's an entirely different thing but here's the
(1:06:03) thing let me ask you this I just want to know so you're saying that's your friend and you're willing to State this on camera
(1:06:09) that your friend's husband was purposely starving their child because you wanted to teach this woman a lesson
(1:06:16) because he's an [ __ ] oh no I have a feeling I have a feeling the
(1:06:22) way he could have been of course there's more to this story she's not gonna air out their entire life he was my friend
(1:06:30) and her husband would deprived her and her baby [ __ ] fine yeah well if you're if the deprivation means no food
(1:06:37) then that's different she was in college and he was the one working uh what's up Angela yeah okay so let's just bring
(1:06:45) this back because Lauren love you but the I don't it's anecdotal I can't really I don't think anyone gets married just becomes an [ __ ] I think these
(1:06:51) things turn into an unless you married an asset and nor the red flag you married an [ __ ] and so that's her problem and it's unfortunate so I want
(1:06:58) to bring everybody yeah I get it as an example but like going to
(1:07:04) Andrew you're saying that people should stay together for the sanity of kids but then you think kids are the byproduct of parents if parents don't have a good
(1:07:10) relationship with each other and the kids stay together with them the reason you have [ __ ] up kids to begin with so by saying if they're not physically
(1:07:17) abusing the child or whatever it could be it's still affecting kids and they're still going to see parents that are neglecting each other so I understand
(1:07:24) the argument here the problem with it is that no when we see these kind of Behavioral elements in society that you
(1:07:30) would considered to be bad such as you know prostitution uh prison all of these
(1:07:35) different things that all of them tend to stem including homelessness from a single mother not from parents who have
(1:07:43) or children who have two parents in the house it's just completely what I'm saying no I'm not I'm not completely
(1:07:50) Nina Nina nobody need your help we don't need your help
(1:07:58) incoherently while drunk again while drunk are you gonna let us finish
(1:08:03) our conversation makes any sense but like Okay so
(1:08:08) yeah about how parents
(1:08:14) rub off on their children I think you as a parent know that correct
(1:08:19) yes I agree oh That's the basis of her argument yeah
(1:08:24) well what is it thank you it's a little weird yeah that's why we're talking because we're talking about outcomes
(1:08:30) because we're talking about outcomes you know so it is I am is the outcome optimal for the
(1:08:37) child even if they're in a home where the the parents don't have an optimal relationship that's what the real
(1:08:43) question is because otherwise why would you break up the family that makes no sense Nina do you
(1:08:49) understand that some people are together and they don't have a healthy relationship together so just because of divorce doesn't mean
(1:08:55) you're still not being a mom or a dad I don't I agree I agree not in every single example but if we're looking
(1:09:00) specifically looking at the outcomes for children who have both parents intact in the home even if the parents don't have
(1:09:07) an optimal relationship the outcomes for the children still tend to end up being better and the outcomes for children
(1:09:13) have always been better outside of single motherhood which has skyrocketed since no fault divorce that is not
(1:09:19) something which is arguable it's just true well yeah two parents but
(1:09:25) um I I mean that that is true that having two parents so marriage is for the children it's not for you to go get
(1:09:31) your man's credit card and go on a shopping spree it's for the children so I
(1:09:37) reactions do
(1:09:43) if a woman for instance deprived a man from sex for a significant amount of
(1:09:48) time on cut him off in front of his friends and was like clearly being emotionally abusive towards him would
(1:09:56) that be grounds for divorce no I think that he has an obligation and a
(1:10:02) duty through you know through his religious convictions to work to work diligently
(1:10:09) in fixing that marriage first and then another question if you are
(1:10:15) emotionally abusing your partner to the point in which it's causing them physical stress so for instance their
(1:10:21) hair falls out or they start cutting themselves or they Sorry Youtube sorry my bad they start doing things that it's
(1:10:28) like physically causing them harm is that considered physical abuse now and are is that grounds for divorce you can
(1:10:35) say whatever you want to my channel this would this would depend on if these are correlates or provables so if you can
(1:10:41) literally go to court and demonstrate my hair fell out because all this guy does
(1:10:46) all day long or you went to the church and demonstrated this my hair literally fell out of my head because of all of
(1:10:53) the verbal abuse and here's the demonstration of this I think the church would probably Grant you a divorce that
(1:10:59) would be emotional abuse because that's pure emotional abuse they're not so there is
(1:11:04) a line for emotional abuse I mean again because it's subjective it's always
(1:11:10) going to be an subjective interpretation for arbitration for it which why I think that having a body of a community which
(1:11:15) you're a part of arbitrate for you is far superior to having strangers in a court who usually side only with one
(1:11:22) party over the other traditionally but earlier there was no line
(1:11:27) I just said that again so I literally just said it again you just said there aren't you understanding
(1:11:33) this there's a physical it doesn't mean that it doesn't mean it's not dude I don't know why is that it's an emotional
(1:11:39) abuse causes your hair to fall out then that's enough but earlier no I didn't say that I said I think that a church
(1:11:45) might Grant you a divorce under those grounds if you could demonstrate that your hair literally fell out due to the
(1:11:52) amount of overt verbal abuse that you were getting from the other partner I don't know how you would demonstrate that but if you could I'm sure that they
(1:11:59) would Grant you in that particular instance a divorce but does it change
(1:12:04) the fact that these are interpretations subjective interpretations which are
(1:12:09) done of what you consider to be emotional abuse do you understand all right guys one one minute mark one
(1:12:15) minute Mark so just one more minute either way whether or not it's the church adjudicating it or the state
(1:12:21) adjudicating it it's a grounds of divorce being emotional abuse
(1:12:27) no well no I think in that case they would they would make a physical argument that this led to physical
(1:12:32) ailments which are detrimental to me and I can demonstrate this through some you know crazy over-the-top means
(1:12:41) when you're talking when you're talking about yes but here's the thing so does
(1:12:46) happy healthy marriages can lead to physical detriments too working 60 hours a week can lead to physical detriments
(1:12:52) if you're doing it on behalf of your family all sorts of things can lead to physical detriments of the body you
(1:12:58) claiming hey it's just emotional abuse which causes these detrimental outcomes is [ __ ] and it's nonsense across the
(1:13:06) board it's a subjective interpretation that you want to utilize in order to push some sort of but what if they're
(1:13:13) abusive in a way that can't be proven that's all it is one of like the biggest factors when it
(1:13:19) comes to male um health detriments and like older age is stress
(1:13:25) yeah but the stress doesn't necessarily come from abuse of your wife it often comes from externality stress is not a
(1:13:32) physical thing it is a an emotional thing that that then causes a physical reaction oh
(1:13:39) it can also be a physical thing you can put a lot of stress on your body physically I hate interrupt but I love this one
(1:13:46) like way longer it's a juicy debate we can we're going to do like a open Panel afterwards so you can revisit this topic
(1:13:52) I actually have a few questions I want to ask myself but I'll wait until the debate is over uh so before we move on
(1:13:58) to the next topic I do want to ask the uh the panel a question uh initially intend this to be pretty balanced I kind
(1:14:04) of look more of like a three on three uh would you guys be okay if we invite uh
(1:14:09) Rachel Andrew's wife on I want to check with everyone on the panel because I didn't clear with any of
(1:14:14) you guys beforehand so if you're not comfortable with that there's no worse I would have a little rejection
(1:14:21) you're cool with it Nina first I love Rachel okay cool I just wanted to be fair uh okay Andrew why
(1:14:27) don't you just send her the link directly I don't feel like it was unfair but okay I'll send her the link library was
(1:14:33) unfair it was like a three-on-one I want to be more balanced ideally yeah I mean it was like unpreneur consent I thought
(1:14:39) listen Andrew if you don't want to talk to your wife I understand okay I saw Andrew and I would be more on the
(1:14:46) same page I actually kind of expected that too well maybe
(1:14:51) your shirt was conservative
(1:14:59) and it's very funny it makes fun of Andrew yeah I don't believe you that
(1:15:04) it's funny but okay it is funny it is funny it has my friend Michael Loftus on it uh-huh yeah it's good [ __ ]
(1:15:12) all right Rachel how long how long do you need to uh jump on if you can make in like 30 seconds then we'll wait for you if not then we'll see yeah I just
(1:15:18) sent her the link on Discord the problem is is that she doesn't have a camera because I'm using the backup cam so you
(1:15:24) may have to move on anyway she can keep her camera off if she wants to she yeah that's why no more fun
(1:15:35) okay we'll we'll get started and she can join when she joins uh okay so the next topic that we're talking about is a
(1:15:42) woman's body count and the question is double does a woman's body count affect her desirability as a long-term dating
(1:15:51) and or marriage partner is everyone clear on the proposition can
(1:15:58) you be a little bit more specific about that you're saying does it affect but like what do you mean does it lower her value as a potential partner
(1:16:06) for long-term dating specifically not for hookups okay specifically women right specifically for women but you can
(1:16:13) bring it together public analogy uh okay Lauren you want to kick it off like last time
(1:16:18) no okay fine let's let uh let's go in opposite order let's let Angela Kick It
(1:16:23) Off um uh do high body counts affect a
(1:16:29) woman's value in the basically the dating markets are basically how men view her as far as dating yes from a
(1:16:36) subjective and an objective perspective like meaning like we are talking about men right just to be clear right yeah
(1:16:42) one argument like for example you could say that like well uh some guys could be you know could view that as a negative
(1:16:48) however I personally don't think it's a negative blah blah blah for this reason right we're interested in that part
(1:16:53) rather than because I think we can all agree that there's going to be some guys that are going to see this negative so that's not even that interesting it's
(1:16:59) more of like what do you think do you think it's a negative right so I used to think that was a negative but due to the
(1:17:05) fact that one in three men are virgins or sexists in the past year I can't say you can be picky with who you get to
(1:17:11) sleep with so we can say that it's probably unattractive to them but I wouldn't say they would turn it down and
(1:17:16) probably realize like it's not that serious after engaging in a relationship with that girl uh and that's my stance
(1:17:23) on that Angela would you personally think it's a negative like forget about the man do you personally think it's uh
(1:17:28) like if you're advising your younger brother or someone like that and uh he was considering a girl with a higher
(1:17:34) body count what that be something you would warn him against or you don't I would say hi so if we say hi we're
(1:17:39) talking about like sex worker high or just like 10 or 8 9 8 9 uh well that's up to you to
(1:17:45) interpret it yeah so I mean I'm gonna go but I'm a pretty normal person so I'm a normal person I would say it's not high
(1:17:51) it's not that serious I don't really know that many sex workers so I don't think it's that serious
(1:17:58) okay cool let's go to oh I think we got uh Mrs Mrs Andrew Wilson that's what she
(1:18:04) calls herself Miss Crucible Mr patriarchy the patriarchy wins again okay we'll have
(1:18:11) you go at the very end uh Rachel okay uh Nina you're next
(1:18:16) um I would actually think generally having a high body count is probably like a good thing when it comes to like
(1:18:22) you're trying to like [ __ ] because like it seems like somebody who knows what they're doing is probably a better partner when it comes to doing any sort
(1:18:28) of sex stuff when it comes to body count in general that can be indicative of a
(1:18:34) lot of different things right like if you have problems having a bonding relationship so therefore you tend to
(1:18:40) just do casual sex it's not there's anything wrong with that personally that might you know not necessarily be a
(1:18:48) problem but it might be again indicative of some personality's fault but I don't
(1:18:54) think that's necessarily the case and I wouldn't say that's the case in most cases obviously as you get older the uh
(1:19:00) time frame is going to shift I I don't really find it at all a problem personally I don't know why it's a
(1:19:09) problem the only time that I really think anyone would think is a problem if they're just incredibly insecure and
(1:19:14) it's just about like oh I'm not going to be able to be like as good as somebody else and I feel uncomfortable but I I
(1:19:20) personally think that somebody with experience is probably a pretty good thing if you're trying to [ __ ] them I
(1:19:26) assume I guess where the question goes is like are you talking about dating or [ __ ] I don't really know
(1:19:31) relationships we're not talking about Denny okay so I I think that's
(1:19:36) you know something you can talk about it's like okay well then why like well then why do you have like like have done that like maybe you had like a wild
(1:19:42) spree or whatever or maybe you were a sex worker for a while like or maybe you did porn I mean existing but uh like
(1:19:49) the reasons why that you might have a high body count are very significantly depending on
(1:19:55) um your life experience of course but I don't think it inherently causes any particular issue
(1:20:00) um personally I like the idea of like the loose [ __ ] is obvious like complete [ __ ] because then it's like if
(1:20:06) you're gonna say that then if you've had a kid then like what like you shouldn't like [ __ ] your
(1:20:12) wife anymore if they have a kid like that'd just be like crazy like to think that that like lowers her value because
(1:20:17) she had a kid that's ridiculous um and I just think that it is a very
(1:20:22) insecure point of view to have to think that like because a woman has [ __ ] a bunch of other people like
(1:20:29) they are for some reason less than I I don't know I've never heard a good argument for it so I'm interested to see
(1:20:34) what happens Andrew you're up next the answer is yes and that every single body
(1:20:39) which is added to the count lowers the uh value on the marketplace of the woman
(1:20:47) every single time at least from the perspective of the man and the man is the one who ultimately ends up with the
(1:20:54) woman and generally speaking seemingly high quality men seem to want women who
(1:20:59) have had less sexual partners or no sexual partners that seems to be optimal
(1:21:05) okay uh Lauren you're up next okay so I try to look up the statistics
(1:21:12) and it seems like as um I forget what year it was but early on women who had 10 bodies or more had
(1:21:19) lower rates of divorce according to these stats however I do have to say
(1:21:24) there was a mathematical and also as time progressed it seems to be more evened out so it doesn't really seem to
(1:21:31) matter if you have high body count low body count um in fact women with two people as I
(1:21:37) think it's like one or two people as their body count had a very high rate for divorce in comparison however the
(1:21:43) mathematical issue that I found with the data that I looked up was it looked at
(1:21:48) all of the women who got divorced and then pulled them based off how many body counts they had and then broke up that
(1:21:55) 100 of divorce into the women and now that women have more bodies on average
(1:22:00) that's going to change what percentage of women are going to be part of the populace but anyway
(1:22:06) um so I Accord it's hard to look look at the math but as I'm looking at the math it does not indicate that women with
(1:22:13) high body counts actually have genuinely higher rates of divorce
(1:22:18) um I've also noticed that the people because I've been in these red pill spaces the people who talk most about
(1:22:25) wanting these women with low body counts seem to be attracted to women who do
(1:22:31) only fans modeling or women who have had promiscuous past so I don't think these
(1:22:36) men are being extremely genuine and also I have been on several first dates in my
(1:22:41) life even though I'm not married and I've never been asked on like these dates what my body count is
(1:22:49) um and so I don't really know really when in this when in most relationships that conversation happens or if it ever
(1:22:56) does happen in most relationships so I don't even know how men can view women
(1:23:01) as lesser or better unless they're just guessing her past promiscuity based off
(1:23:06) like I don't know her face like I don't know where men are gonna get get that information and also women lie so how
(1:23:12) how would you even know like what and then um also I don't know if this low
(1:23:20) body count thing is working out for people like Stephen Crowder for instance his wife had an extremely low body count
(1:23:25) allegedly she was a flipping virgin look how that's going for him now he's a single father of twins
(1:23:32) um and yeah I'll leave it there let me let me just quickly clarify Lauren are you
(1:23:37) talking about the study from Institute of family studies is that the one we're talking about different one let me see I
(1:23:42) had it up um yeah yes okay so that's funny yeah I did
(1:23:50) a whole video on that so that's funny is interesting so basically this is I'm not trying to get them all in debate but this is what the study shows it shows
(1:23:56) that uh divorce uh I guess whatever percentage for virgins is really low and
(1:24:01) it goes up when you go to one two then it dips by a little bit and then when
(1:24:07) you get past like nine or ten it goes starts going up again so it's like zero one it's because it has to do with the
(1:24:13) age range that those things happen and then not so just to clarify for the chat all right Rachel can go next
(1:24:21) so sorry I wasn't logging on I really I really wanted to do the no fault one darn it maybe we'll revisit that after
(1:24:27) not that Andrew needs my help but I thought maybe I could break up the the woman prattle a little bit with
(1:24:33) something less [ __ ] so uh we're talking about body counts and if it matters in the context of marriage is
(1:24:40) that sort of thing the the debate proposition is does a girl's body count Lower her uh
(1:24:47) desirability to be a successful long-term dating or marriage partner
(1:24:52) desirability like it's from the man's point of view it no it's more I'm looking at it from
(1:24:58) your perspective so meaning like you have a younger brother and he's like hey I'm dating this girl but her body count
(1:25:03) is like 40. do you think I should marry her that from your perspective do you think that that lowers your value to be
(1:25:10) a good long-term partner that's kind of the the Paradigm we're looking at through yeah yeah absolutely it does and I would say
(1:25:17) the reasoning for that is a couple of things number one the higher your body count is uh the more likely you are to
(1:25:24) have been on birth control which Alters mate selection the more likely you are to have an FTD we have about a quarter
(1:25:30) of you know women now having STDs it's higher in some populations and then also
(1:25:36) um the likelihood of her having had an abortion would be higher um things like that and then the higher
(1:25:43) your body count is um we would hope you're older but if you're younger with a higher body count
(1:25:48) you're probably going to have trouble pair bonding it's probably a red flag uh for you know probably growing up in a
(1:25:54) fatherless home being a child of divorce and if you grew up with a single mom you're probably more likely to have
(1:25:59) dysfunction in your relationships than get divorced so if I were a man or if it was a man I cared about no I
(1:26:06) would not want to check with a high body count so just just to quickly add uh since I
(1:26:12) intervened on the other side so Rachel is not too far off it's not one out of four it's one out of five people currently have an STD but anyway small
(1:26:18) difference anyway all right open panels or is it just women it's it's you just
(1:26:25) said women people in general foreign
(1:26:31) have a lower rate of STD versus men I'm looking it up I'll look it up also I
(1:26:37) have a question if this woman has had exceedingly high body count but she's never been on birth control she's never
(1:26:42) had an STD and she's never had an abortion does that change your mind at all how on Earth how on Earth would you
(1:26:49) have a really high body count but never have had kids or had an abortion
(1:26:57) would be a really easy answer you could do porn and in porn they do a lot of STD
(1:27:02) checking like a lot investing checking so she could be extremely careful and then she could also be timing her
(1:27:09) um abortions do you think that do you think that high quality men want to marry chicks who've done porn Lauren
(1:27:16) are you serious you have any idea the amount of like men that are just like psychotically obsessed with porn stars
(1:27:25) let's say he was just really just real forehand and she I can't hear
(1:27:31) when you're both harping like that can one I have stopped talking I'm sorry that you're lagging but let's not can
(1:27:39) get into that let's just work with what we we got do okay you mentioned two two
(1:27:45) times now that you don't like women so I don't understand the internal hates
(1:27:56) that's because you're harping that has nothing to do with whether or not she likes women Nina's making the most sense
(1:28:01) right now let's stay focused okay so if there's a woman who had maybe an
(1:28:07) extremely high body count however she never had an STD she'd never had an abortion and she's never been on birth
(1:28:13) control how would you feel about this person okay I'll tell that's a great question
(1:28:18) I'll tell you how I feel I would say you should marry her because she's a literal unicorn and she probably has magic
(1:28:25) powers um so I would say in that case if if you found a magical unicorn porn star with a
(1:28:32) high body count who's never been on birth control never had an abortion doesn't have an STD and somehow avoided
(1:28:37) pregnancy she probably has which magic some kind of unicorn magic power so I'd
(1:28:42) say go for it no she has access to [ __ ] Planned Parenthood you don't know how STDs of abortions
(1:28:54) hang on one second one second Rachel you're lagging really badly listen off your camera just turn off your camera
(1:29:00) just turn off your camera so first of all Planned Parenthood does other things you still have to no Rachel
(1:29:08) you still have to have he'll come back in give her a second okay there we go
(1:29:15) and you could be a person who understands how to test whether or not you're ovulating because they do have
(1:29:21) ovulation tests they also have the ability to prevent so that would prevent
(1:29:26) the abortions that would and then you can also do STD texting that would prevent STDs and then you wouldn't need
(1:29:31) birth control these are outliers these are incredible outliers Lauren but yeah
(1:29:44) to outliers it's worthless no because I'm asking about the high body count so if the issue is women with estimates
(1:29:50) it's not that's not just the issue or if the issue is women who get
(1:29:55) abortions that's another issue however you're saying high body count is the issue so I'm wondering if you isolate
(1:30:02) high body count just that specific barrier the answer would still be no so the answer would still be that even then
(1:30:08) because of virtue so men tend to look especially high quality men for virtues
(1:30:14) in women the same types of Virtues you're looking for in men so what are the virtues that you're looking for in men like how can you explain what you
(1:30:20) mean yes I am you have to be quiet though as I explain with the virtue is yeah no I was done talking go ahead yeah
(1:30:26) great so the first one virtue would probably be something like loyalty I would guess you would not want your
(1:30:32) spouse spouse to be running around with other other people right that would be one of my guesses you'd want somebody
(1:30:38) who had Temperance you'd want somebody who followed what is temperance man even keeled
(1:30:43) self-control they have self-control okay what does that mean in like a practical like day-to-day sense they're not
(1:30:50) impulsive they don't just pop off and do crazy [ __ ] right they're even keeled you
(1:30:57) need that explained honestly I mean we can't explain it if you need us to but I think you know what
(1:31:03) it means not yeah exactly not impulsive uh
(1:31:09) doesn't go crazy very predictable right things like this those are the types of
(1:31:14) attributes that most people look for in a partner they're not looking people want boring people that doesn't seem
(1:31:20) like that's a very awesome you think that's boring just describing it makes
(1:31:26) it seem like it's [ __ ] boring not to be crazy like being not spontaneous
(1:31:36) we need a porn star otherwise life is boring
(1:31:42) what are your other things we don't have to get caught up in this is that it
(1:31:48) is well no that's not it there's many other
(1:31:53) virtues and when you're looking at virtues if you'd like me to give you a list of the cardinal virtues I can do so
(1:31:59) but yeah I literally am pulling them up so that I
(1:32:04) can I'll read them off to you so that you have them so you could be a non-impulsive person in fact it would
(1:32:11) take a pretty non I'm thinking to do ovulation tests and
(1:32:16) to make sure that you're wearing a groom like yes but Chastity is also a virtue why every why'd you always
(1:32:22) ask why because I wasn't done talking first of all I was talking you interrupted me oh my God you guys keep
(1:32:28) doing this so anyway Chastity Chastity is another one of the virtues so if you're looking at women who have
(1:32:34) Chastity especially this is why virginity is so prized in society especially as we have so that's your
(1:32:39) reply to both right especially as we have very few virgins and yes it does do
(1:32:44) you think that a virginal woman should uh marry a man that's been kind of slotting it up
(1:32:52) here's a really simple way to to frame it okay I'm really just gonna derailing I'm sorry let's stay focused I'm sorry
(1:32:58) if you're looking at if you're looking at Chastity between both of them there's a reason that Lauren just stated when
(1:33:05) you have two people who are virgins who get married they actually tend to stay married a lot longer yes it is true okay read it powder
(1:33:14) Crowder is a perfect example
(1:33:20) just don't show that to be true even over time in fact the highest of course when when divorcers were first people
(1:33:27) the highest the people who first get divorced like in the biggest numbers were people who were buried as virgins
(1:33:34) your studies your study that you just cited the one
(1:33:39) of the first things that you said was that people with a low body count tend to stay married longer that's what you
(1:33:47) literally just said yes you did then read it read your studies yesterday
(1:33:56) that's later hang on hang on there's there's an aberration I'm not even talking about the aberration though I'm just saying that if you have people who
(1:34:03) are religious and Chase and have a low body count who get married tend to stay married longer that's in the data that
(1:34:08) you're looking at right now no it's not then then read the data over time too
(1:34:14) yes it changes over time with body count that's true but if you're younger in your virgins yes you do tend to stay
(1:34:21) together for longer periods of time they're like when no fault divorces
(1:34:29) became available in U.S history there was different like the rates of which people got divorced and their body
(1:34:35) counts have shifted over time and that's shifted with culture yes
(1:34:42) I have a question when did you have the conversation rate and Rachel you can
(1:34:48) answer this Rachel Andrew when did you guys have the conversation about each other's body counts before you got
(1:34:53) married if you guys don't want to answer that that's fine too yeah I don't want to do anecdotal stuff and here's why
(1:34:59) this is that you've been talking forever
(1:35:05) well I got it listen she'll just talk forever unless I say something
(1:35:10) hang on you guys all talk forever okay we're all Debaters we all talk forever
(1:35:16) yeah let her rephrase the question then you can answer it go ahead when did you have
(1:35:23) that conversation I'm not going to talk about my personal life in a debate here's how you have
(1:35:30) your conversation here's how you can understand it the reason men value a low body count in women is because it means
(1:35:37) she's valuable she doesn't just give herself away to anyone it's the same way it's the same reason women don't value
(1:35:44) simps because how does a man do whatever you want let her finish now let her
(1:35:49) finish so the reason men don't want [ __ ] is because the same reason women don't want
(1:35:55) simps if you're that easy to get nobody wants you it's that simple you don't have to know a woman's body count
(1:36:03) well you could probably get to know her and know if she's had 50 other dudes
(1:36:08) before you you'd probably be able to tell from reputation only fans all sorts
(1:36:14) of different things is that not true
(1:36:22) I never first of all hang on we've never why why is it let me ask you
(1:36:29) a question how many sexual partners have you had how many dicks have you sucked Lauren so you're lying no yes uh-huh well yes
(1:36:38) you're lying so that's so rude so here's so here's the thing are you guys serious
(1:36:44) I mean if you're gonna ask us this is proof women can lie she's gonna say I'm
(1:36:49) lying because it's true
(1:36:54) she didn't she didn't say you're alive okay I like you a lot more Rachel we
(1:37:00) could be friends no we can't we absolutely cannot because the sound of your voice is like nails on a chalkboard
(1:37:06) you realize you guys sound exactly the same right no because I ain't on time to Lang a
(1:37:13) mess the same
(1:37:18) no we don't know
(1:37:24) are you serious right now I don't even need an impression do you
(1:37:30) want to hear my new impression yes I would love to I love you then Mandrell
(1:37:36) yeah can you knock some Preston no but I can
(1:37:42) I do a really good Alex impression yeah this is Alex
(1:37:54) I do saw a thing although I feel like you got my voice
(1:38:00) what's up guys this is Alex from playing with friends I know you want to sound I know you want
(1:38:06) to sound like that but you you don't know slightly confused like hey this is Alex and um today I'm going to teach you
(1:38:13) how to get a chick's phone number sometimes and it works I assure you Andrew I am definitely not
(1:38:21) confused all right let's get back to the initial proposition okay yeah she reminds me of just pearly things like
(1:38:27) almost to a t but anyway I don't think that you would be able to
(1:38:33) know a woman's body count unless you told it to you and she was honest so your whole thing about valuing a woman
(1:38:39) based off her body count and then also you mentioned pair bonding which is like the weakest there's literally no science
(1:38:46) there's correlation causation which you should know is not uh justifiable in the
(1:38:51) scientific mind but it's just as justifiable as your
(1:38:56) definition of emotional abuse which is nonsense bro what like one was a scientific
(1:39:03) you're trying to say care bonding is a scientific thing that happens due to no I'm saying it's if you can bring up
(1:39:11) emotionally you have no more support for emotional abuse than I would prepare bonding no because emotional abuse is a
(1:39:19) thing now you can argue about what level of emotional abuse is Justified for a
(1:39:24) divorce that's a subjective issue for but you're saying pair bond well it wasn't five minutes ago exist and pair
(1:39:30) bonding is a true thing implies that there is some sort of a chemical issue that in which you have
(1:39:37) sexual it could be it doesn't have to be chemical emotional as well it doesn't have to yeah it doesn't have to be
(1:39:42) chemicals yeah you said you said pair bonding pair
(1:39:49) bonding that is the that is the discussion not strictly chemical yeah
(1:39:56) it's a psychological emotional phenomenon as well just
(1:40:12) what aspect of pair bonding is taken away from with a higher body account like how do you get the pair if it's
(1:40:19) emotionally based then like what does it have to do with like physics I'll tell you so it used to be that this was this
(1:40:25) was argued from an oxytocin perspective but they recently did studies on voles where they saw that the voles would
(1:40:32) still pair bond even absent the oxytocin meaning that there must be some sort of emotional response or physiological
(1:40:38) response which happens even when oxytocin is taken out of the equation so what Rachel is saying to you is even if
(1:40:46) this is not purely chemical due to the science and I can send you the vole study if you want to see it I know
(1:40:51) because I prefer this debate on pair bonding tomorrow on this channel right okay what you're going to find out is
(1:40:58) hey there's also emotional bonding which happens even inside of animals which are close cousins in in this case from a
(1:41:04) biological sensor stating the scientists are that these are at least the closest thing that we can find who pair bond so
(1:41:10) there's an emotional status to this as well as a chemical status of oxytocin it's not just a one a one sleeve fits
(1:41:17) all that type of thing but to say some scientific or it's not studies insane because I didn't say anything that I'm asking you no but Lauren did say that
(1:41:24) she said it's totally unscientific and it's not totally unscientific is it Lauren so did I just give you a literal
(1:41:31) scientific data put your life for me to send you the study right now
(1:41:41) you've read the study what's the animal what's the animal again in the in the study what animal
(1:41:46) are they studying Andrew what is the animal they're studying
(1:41:52) let us finish our conversation you don't have to play Captain Save A Hoe every five minutes now Lauren Lauren why did
(1:41:59) they use voles in the study um because they're similar to humans in
(1:42:06) terms of balls are similar to humans I don't in terms of chemical and also because they're cheap rodent type
(1:42:12) animals used in a lot of studies so you don't know why they were used specifically what do we use
(1:42:19) why did they use voles for this scientific study that you read answer the question
(1:42:24) is shut up Nina answer the question
(1:42:33) I want the question answered nina not your proudly Lauren why did they use while you're doing this Nina Lauren
(1:42:41) answer my question why don't you give me an answer no I want you to answer because you read the study you just got
(1:42:46) done saying yeah I don't know why did they use what why did they use voles I
(1:42:54) call right you don't know you don't know the primary reasons for the study which you cited because
(1:43:00) they're bond for life that's why hold on that doesn't make any sense
(1:43:06) that literally makes no sense so you're saying that they did a scientific study to prove pair bonding existed
(1:43:14) which they knew that pair bond they pair bonded that would be so circular that
(1:43:20) it's not circular let me tell you why because they were looking at the oxytocin uh portion here and the
(1:43:27) oxytocin when they pulled the oxytocin out of the animal they still pair bonded so they're trying to equate this to
(1:43:33) humans to say maybe it's not oxytocin or a chemical reaction that leads to the pair bonding of human beings you're you
(1:43:40) your argument is circular and not that's not necessary it's a study it's a study
(1:43:47) the likely reason that they actually use the soul is because it's the most common animal used no it's because they pair
(1:43:54) bond for life that's why and they wanted to see if they would continue remove the oxytocin yes that's why they
(1:44:01) it literally says in the study that's why they use them
(1:44:06) holy [ __ ] you're crazy you're crazy
(1:44:12) maybe you can link to study in the private chat just so they can take a look at it yeah Angela has been uh trying to speak for
(1:44:19) like 20 minutes let's just let her get away go ahead you're good no wait so you guys are saying people with hot high body
(1:44:24) counts basically aren't relationship material what is a high body count to you question
(1:44:30) are you asking me yeah I think she's asking yeah so I would so for me I think that it's actually easier to reduce it
(1:44:37) to this to just say that every additional person that a woman has slept with in the eyes of men likely lowers
(1:44:45) her value to most men that's the way that I would frame it so I was giving it like an arbitrary number
(1:44:51) without system and just saying something like well maybe it's nine maybe it's eight maybe it's what is the factor I
(1:44:57) don't know that we would all agree that that's true but I think that most men would agree that the more that we add the worse that it is
(1:45:03) it's working the question is intend to look at it from your perspective so imagine your son when he gets older
(1:45:09) comes to you and says hey Dad you know this girl I'm dating has a body count of whatever is that too high that's kind of
(1:45:15) what the question is is on to our probe yeah well I understand but I think that
(1:45:21) that question in and of itself the reason that he's coming to me to even ask the question to begin with is
(1:45:26) because he would think that x amount of people that this chick has slept with is a red flag to begin with that's the
(1:45:33) point that I'm making so let's reduce it I would say that every well the red flag is that you're promiscuous and
(1:45:38) promiscuous I have less trust what I have a question if virgins are so
(1:45:43) desirable why aren't men just going like straight to churches and finding the
(1:45:49) most in Mass they really I I are going to the clubs to find women listen
(1:45:55) they're going the the amount of young men which has skyrocketed inside of even
(1:46:02) what you would consider to be obscure churches in the United States like Orthodoxy for instance which has skyrocketed in membership is due to
(1:46:10) younger men statistics
(1:46:15) I'm going to be allowed to answer questions without you interrupting yes I just wanted to say my piece
(1:46:21) check you never never stop talking right so one more so one more time I'm going to explain this to you in more
(1:46:27) traditional churches memberships are shooting up through the roof now what Nina is trying to counter is wait a
(1:46:33) second there's actually been a reduction of X and that's not true there has not been a reduction of Acts of Orthodox in
(1:46:39) the United States it's shot through the roof and Catholicism and Catholicism is also on the rise for younger men and you
(1:46:46) see this specifically because they're trying to have a return to tradition yeah it is true whether you shake your
(1:46:52) head or not I've been hemorrhoid Kings and especially since coven uh maybe I have to ask you Andrew do you think that
(1:46:59) Rachel is worth less after you [ __ ] her uh
(1:47:04) dude why are you asking me that is a fair question don't you
(1:47:10) [ __ ] act like it isn't it yeah I think I think that you're worthless because you haven't only fans Nina that's what I think do you that's not
(1:47:17) answering my question yeah I'm not going to answer your personal questions and when you bring one up
(1:47:22) do you think that it's not it's not a personal question I'm saying it's it's it is she's not worth less to me I mean
(1:47:30) yeah be worth less to somebody else it's something that she is she is or less
(1:47:35) than somebody else I think that from a man's perspective that she would be worth less
(1:47:41) I didn't think he was trying to be offensive I was just asking the question that's fair you were just asking the question how many times yes how many
(1:47:48) people paid you have people paid you to do private only fan systems for them Nina
(1:47:53) wait how do you know I have an only fans dude for Twitter Nina
(1:47:59) no I don't you're just you do you were looking for that [ __ ] if you found I'm looking for it
(1:48:05) it's not that other people post your [ __ ] they're only friends in like two years as much as much as much as I lost
(1:48:13) question but then Andrew and Rachel can answer a basic question I did answer it
(1:48:19) has a conversation mother's bodies count
(1:48:24) yeah again I'll answer that question Lauren I think it's fair as soon as you tell me how many dicks you sucked zero
(1:48:31) and you're not lying about this and how would I determine and how would I determine that you're
(1:48:37) not lying exactly Andrew so your point your point right so your point here for
(1:48:43) the question is to determine that with that you can lie because it's not disputed I don't think that you're lying
(1:48:49) because I think you're lying right now right like this is kind of bad faith here you wouldn't really understand that
(1:48:55) like I think that we're living in a in in or we're having a conversation where I trust what you're saying like and I
(1:49:02) assume everyone else does why do you think that she's lying what so again I
(1:49:07) think that the purpose I think that the purpose the purpose of her demonstration
(1:49:12) of saying hey how would you ever make that determination based on the amount of information that I've that you've
(1:49:18) given me right now I couldn't but that doesn't mean that if I was dating you or somebody else was for God's sakes that
(1:49:24) they could not investigate to make a determination as to whether or not you've slept with other men that's just the most ridiculous thing I've ever
(1:49:30) heard Lauren to be honest it's just ridiculous you can value women and add
(1:49:36) value to them and subtract value to them based off their body count a number that you could only really ever get by asking
(1:49:42) a woman and then you know don't just get it by asking a woman that's a straw man
(1:49:48) that's a straw man so I've given you multiple ways that men will investigate women
(1:49:56) that's nice dating you Lauren so like what's your point your point the point
(1:50:01) is you gave multiple ways in which you could determine a woman is high body count one of the ways was only fans and
(1:50:07) all of the various yeah but you would have to be interested in the woman so if you're dating the woman I think that
(1:50:12) most men would probably want to know how many uh dudes the chick has slept with that seems to be pretty common I was
(1:50:18) interested in me and they looked into me by looking up my what history or whatever they would be not able to see
(1:50:26) what my body count is because I don't post and so you'd have to assume I'm a virgin I guess because I don't post
(1:50:32) about my sexual escapades and I don't have an only thing so you go put on it so you go out on a date with a guy and
(1:50:38) he says do you have an ex-boyfriend and you're like yeah I have X amount of ex-boyfriends right or this type of
(1:50:45) thing so if you're appear as the driven snow when he investigates then fine
(1:50:51) he's not going to meet your family what is this argument
(1:51:00) okay so a guy that's dated maybe two girls for like within the past like eight years the third girl and the girls
(1:51:06) probably had five boyfriends or five bodies is that a deal breaker from
(1:51:11) because we can't really break this down so it would that's gonna be more than him so you're saying men wouldn't value
(1:51:17) that so I don't think that it's necessarily a deal breaker right I think
(1:51:22) that all I'm saying is that if the man is presented let's say all things equal across the board let me just ask you
(1:51:29) guys this question all things equal across the board so it's the same guy or same guy basically and same exact woman
(1:51:37) essentially okay they have the choice they can pick the same version of this woman who's [ __ ] five dudes or the
(1:51:43) same version of this woman who's [ __ ] no dudes which woman do you think that they would pick all things equal
(1:51:50) well I mean I think I mean would you not want something with experience like I would think they'd answer my question just answer the question don't ask any
(1:51:57) question answer me a question I think I think my new men would go for the non-virgin I do I genuinely do yeah
(1:52:04) maybe a major worst pill I've ever heard who's the
(1:52:10) Virgin let me ask you the same question piece of [ __ ] cope Andrew and when you ask us a question
(1:52:16) and when we answer it honestly you say that word I didn't answer you asked me questions
(1:52:25) I answered your question Andrew have you heard of cooking have you heard of this concept of cucks
(1:52:32) in fact there's a wide variety of men in in the United States around the world who enjoy watching women get [ __ ] and
(1:52:40) then sometimes want to [ __ ] those women afterwards because they're [ __ ] in fact they like they prefer women would you
(1:52:45) date one of them would you date one of those [ __ ] would you date one Lauren would you date a cuck maybe maybe you
(1:52:53) would if he was like a super nice guy and he said listen I just want to watch my best friend [ __ ] you and then I can
(1:52:59) do so afterwards you would be cool with that right right [ __ ] them and like no I'm just asking Lawrence because
(1:53:04) members if there's a degree of [ __ ] she maybe would date one can you tell me the criteria in which you would maybe date a
(1:53:09) cook Lauren I can't wait to hear it I fell in love with somebody and he
(1:53:15) wants you to get railed by his best friend that's fine with you look I'm not I don't
(1:53:25) have for everybody else you would find that enjoyable like you like the idea of getting [ __ ] by multiple guys yeah
(1:53:31) okay I want you to do this close your eyes and tell me one woman you know who likes that go ahead look there's this
(1:53:39) person eat that one right so I think of the scenario I gave you was a little bit more realistic but when you created the
(1:53:45) hypothetic of all things equal across before like I understand like that obviously that sounds amazing on paper but it's just not realistic being that
(1:53:51) it's easier for women to at least engage into the hookup culture or get sex so we're talking about the realities of a
(1:53:58) guy who probably has only dated one or two girls versus a girl who probably dated Five Guys uh that's five bodies so
(1:54:04) you're saying to go back so she's not valuable but she's dated Five Guys Lena the plug thank you chat
(1:54:11) no I don't I don't I don't think so I don't necessarily think that's a deal breaker for every guy so you've got
(1:54:17) hundreds of millions of people there's obviously going to be room for these Dynamics the point of the hypothetical
(1:54:23) is just to demonstrate this that if all things are equal and you think a man had to pick with it's the same exact woman
(1:54:30) but he gets the same exact woman Untouched by other men or he gets the same exact woman after she's had many
(1:54:35) sexual partners which one do you think he would prefer I think that most I think that most reasonable people can
(1:54:42) Intuit he would prefer the one who is Untouched by other men yeah how do you
(1:54:47) do you think that that's incorrect is the question I think we should clarify Andrew when
(1:54:53) you say a lot of men like what range are you thinking of because that could be you know subjective based on a person
(1:54:59) are you thinking 10 50 100 500 like what's what's a ballpark
(1:55:04) I again I I think that just every time you add one it's worse than I don't know you're posing the question I can't give
(1:55:11) you a definitive deal breaker for every man that's impossible what you mean when you say a lot of men
(1:55:18) I again it's an art it's an arbitrary metric yes exactly just a ballpark I
(1:55:24) agree so try to understand you're missing the
(1:55:29) point the point isn't whether or not it's arbitrary no hang on the point isn't whether or not it's an arbitrary
(1:55:36) system I've already conceded that it's arbitrary what we're trying to do now is just determine intuitively what do you
(1:55:43) think that most men would prefer and that will give us an idea as to why it is that men kind of would prefer to have
(1:55:50) a lower body count even if they can't tell you specifically why that is let me explain it through why wait let me just
(1:55:57) clarify this let me explain why I'm asking the question because I think earlier you mentioned let's ask Alex and
(1:56:02) then you guys change gears but if so if you if you give me a hypothetical the girl is a virgin or she's one of the 100
(1:56:09) bodies I would say I'll take the Virgin but if you give me a hypothetical where it's like a girl's a virgin or she's
(1:56:14) been with Five Guys I'll take the girl that's not a virgin I'll take the girl it's been with five guys so it does
(1:56:19) matter just because I don't want a girl who's a virgin because of preference right but there's no but here's the thing exactly you think do you think
(1:56:27) most men would Intuit that yeah yeah I think most men would want their dick sucked by a woman who's never sucked a
(1:56:33) dick or a woman well I don't want to forget about them okay
(1:56:42) the Virgin you think he's gonna pick someone who has experience I doubt he's going to get another virgin there's most women aren't virgins right so that's no
(1:56:49) it's not that I would just say like after dealing with the virgin of realizing like how much of a downspout no it is that I think that if if he had
(1:56:55) his choice um of the woman of the woman that he fell in love with whoever that is right
(1:57:01) and he could have her own or have her while she's been touched by
(1:57:07) other men he would Intuit out if he was given that choice he would prefer her to not have been touched by other men
(1:57:12) that's what I think bro I think we still never answers never answered my question I answered
(1:57:18) you your mouth now can you tell me when you had the conversation with your wife
(1:57:24) about your body each other's body counts we've been married for 18 years I couldn't even tell you did you have that
(1:57:30) conversation yeah did you not have the conversation at all very early of course we had the conversation everybody does
(1:57:37) no not everybody does yeah I think everybody does at some point I really do I've never been in a relationship where
(1:57:43) we haven't had the conversation ever in my life you guys have been married for a long
(1:57:48) time right yeah I've been married for a long time but I'm an old man how many relationships well now you're just how many more
(1:57:55) personal questions would you like to have how many relationships you don't have to you don't have to answer it how many have homosexuals
(1:58:01) actually earlier how many boyfriends yeah
(1:58:12) remember remember personal domain first you brought it into the personal domain first not us no
(1:58:20) okay I have a question for you girls watch the video I have a question do you guys think that do you guys think that
(1:58:26) body count affects the reliability of a man's like Assurance of his paternity of
(1:58:33) his children in other words if he marries a woman who slept with 25 guys versus a woman who slept with three guys
(1:58:40) who do you think he's going to be more secure in the paternity of his children
(1:58:49) if she slept with 25 guys like over the course of years you only
(1:58:55) slept with him nine months before the baby came out versus a girl who slept
(1:59:00) with three different dudes around nine months the baby no no no no I mean I mean you're looking
(1:59:07) for a woman to marry who you want to have children with okay and girl a has
(1:59:12) slept with 25 guys and girl B has slept with three guys and the guy is going hmm
(1:59:18) I feel like with girl B I can be more certain that the children are going to be mine I feel like she's probably not
(1:59:25) going wait what you're quitting if you guys think that it's related yes
(1:59:34) I actually would be more concerned with the person on his lower body count I guess if I had to pick I think that's a
(1:59:39) silly argument but if I had yeah but you're also a prostitute so I mean this
(1:59:44) is you're like oh I'm sorry
(1:59:50) if you have only fans you're a prostitute I'm sorry and you've been
(1:59:55) attacking her for her only family what do you mean like is this mad
(2:00:02) because you stopped posting Nina
(2:00:10) do you understand I only did loots right
(2:00:22) you were just selling your flash for money right no I just was taking pictures what do
(2:00:28) you mean no yes that's yes I'm selling my flesh birthday pictures
(2:00:38) stop are you saying that you did not post pictures to your only fans that you
(2:00:44) thought were going to make men sexually gratify themselves is that what you're really claiming not really
(2:00:51) not really what I just wanted some pictures I thought it looked cool and and they look hot like whatever like how
(2:00:58) many females how many females were buying those pictures does it matter it would matter yeah
(2:01:05) I didn't want to see the pictures and that's why they're buying them okay it
(2:01:10) makes you a prostitute who's your audience Andrew what is your audience what it what is the demographic of your
(2:01:16) audience 96 male
(2:01:25) no dudes
(2:01:33) wow they're so smart do you think that they're actually pleasuring themselves to be Nina what the hell what kind of
(2:01:40) are you doing that they don't you're a handsome guy you are selling you're selling pictures of yourself lewds or
(2:01:47) nudes or whatever because and men are buying them because it's sexually gratifying you know that that's why it's
(2:01:53) being done that's prostitution I don't know why you'd be upset with me for pointing that out
(2:01:58) I I'm not I just think it's really silly that's yeah you guys they seem pretty
(2:02:04) upset five seconds ago even though I didn't say anything wrong so this is this is the face of someone who's really upset yeah we're so upset we're going
(2:02:11) around calling people drunkards and [ __ ] and stuff and talking about I didn't call her a [ __ ] I said she was a
(2:02:17) prostitute and you're a prostitute too it's just it's online [ __ ] like you're selling
(2:02:23) your entire like people who watch your show because they like you it's your persona exactly so you don't go to work
(2:02:30) so ridiculous wait yeah honestly think that there aren't some
(2:02:35) people who probably jerk off to [ __ ] Rachel like are you serious right now yeah
(2:02:45) lady yeah even if that's true that's not the first of what she's attempting to do and that is the purpose of what you're
(2:02:51) attempting to do that's a distinction between intent Institute again Andrew I have not posted
(2:02:57) on that [ __ ] in two years all it was okay I don't advertise it at all
(2:03:04) um if you want to call me that I guess you can but I feel like it's very silly and it's like much of a cope on your end
(2:03:09) okay former prostitute my bad
(2:03:17) yeah coming to these ad hominem attacks just shows that you're oh yeah we started
(2:03:22) those we started those not you guys
(2:03:27) I didn't say anything bad I love Rachel I love you you know we're we're besties so like I don't know the whole purpose
(2:03:33) of you guys Nina has itchy at all the purpose and the attempt of trying to dive into our personal life and personal
(2:03:40) Dynamics we just asked a question and we said if you weren't comfortable you don't have to answer it yeah and we and
(2:03:45) here's the thing you know first on her personal show no I didn't yeah over here you literally called me off you had not
(2:03:51) asked anybody on this panel a personal question until one was asked of us promise you can play the video back so
(2:03:57) you somebody else asks a personal question and you can ask a personal question of anybody else on the panel it doesn't really I mean here's if it's
(2:04:03) good for the goose it's good for the gander if you're going to dive into it let's get back on the body count let me get off the uh
(2:04:10) I won't say Nina has always been pretty respectful to me so I'm not gonna go that hard no I love you Rachel
(2:04:17) thanks Nina I love you too oh no but anyways that was a very touching moment
(2:04:22) it was so do you guys think that a chick can have a sky high body count and it
(2:04:29) just has no effect on her ability to be a good mother and a good wife it just totally doesn't matter
(2:04:35) I think you need to prove why that would become a problem I think there can be issues like you
(2:04:41) pointed out like earlier about like maybe she has an STD or maybe she's done
(2:04:47) uh like I personally don't think
(2:04:52) I would need to see the data again about abortions and the ability to have further children because I've heard
(2:04:57) mixed issues on that um how so if not having an abortion in the past is important to you and also
(2:05:04) I'm pro-life so that could be important to me as well statistically Lauren on that one just to really quick I'm sorry
(2:05:10) if I'm like doodling a little bit um it's generally this is the statistics are the same of having a child
(2:05:17) um if not less so yes there are a more health risk when you have an abortion
(2:05:23) but it's the same that you would if you were to carry out a pregnancy so okay kind of a wash on that one so
(2:05:29) I understand that part but but those are just you're saying it statistically more likely to happen if she has a high body
(2:05:36) count but if you're isolating the variable of high body count I don't necessarily think that that would
(2:05:41) prevent her from being a good mother um and I also think that there are things that you could benefit from
(2:05:47) having a high like you have a benefit of experience and of maybe warning your kids about the dangers who promiscuity
(2:05:53) and so you have either he's beneficial you know I always think that's a really bizarre argument because I'm just
(2:06:01) wondering what y'all are doing in the bedroom that you think you need to go through like 20 or 30 dudes to figure it
(2:06:08) out it's pretty simple there's only a few parts and they can only be put together in so many ways like yeah
(2:06:27) no Rachel it's like so you're saying these extremes example like a really high body count and this is why I hate
(2:06:33) these conversations because it's like I I think I'm pretty normal so I'm gonna say just an average body count whatever an average girl is but if we're talking
(2:06:40) about like sex workers or like people that are like in the porn industry I'm assuming they're always going to date somebody they work with they're in the
(2:06:47) same industry they're never just gonna go date like a regular average guy who doesn't really who wasn't exposed to this lifestyle or maybe like having
(2:06:52) multiple partners so I just go ahead well I'm sorry I didn't mean to cut you off actually
(2:06:58) Angela has been decent the entire panel but uh Angela I just just did want to
(2:07:03) point this out though there is a post uh porn industry for most of these women
(2:07:09) right so they're not in they're only in porn when they're viable to be in porn and that's usually when they're younger
(2:07:15) and prettier right they're not usually they're not they're not usually rolling porn into their 40s 50s 60s this and
(2:07:21) that when they do leave when they do leave that industry it is true so when they do leave that industry uh there is
(2:07:27) a shelf life for porn workers yeah I have so anyway back to what I'm
(2:07:33) literally the most popular Point yeah to what I was saying to Angela they do they do tend to actually leave that industry
(2:07:39) and then they're not hooking up with people who are in the industry they're not marrying people who are in the
(2:07:44) industry uh things like this so most porn workers are not people you've ever heard of anyway and the shelf life for
(2:07:51) people who enter into pornography is very very low it's not something that they do usually long term I love how you
(2:07:57) just say anything because in their facts but then don't bring do you want to yeah you're actually wrong about that there's
(2:08:03) a lot to see the shelf life of a porn worker
(2:08:13) you can't bring up exceptions and claim they're the rule how insane are you lady
(2:08:19) average we're talking about Africa you're saying
(2:08:25) that you are not saying on averages it's three to four years three to four years exactly it's three to four years yeah
(2:08:31) because the industry is hard it's it's yeah it's a it's a [ __ ] up industry that doesn't mean that like people are
(2:08:37) not interested in you after three or four years it just means that people just tend to leave the industry after
(2:08:42) three to four years because the industry tends to be very abusive especially if we're going into the industry
(2:08:48) so then Nina if the argument is but wait a second aren't all these porn stars
(2:08:54) just hooking up with people in the industry it's like well probably not since they're only in the industry on average for only a couple of years right
(2:09:00) Nina okay but if they're in like if they're in that industry for that a particular
(2:09:05) amount of time like um they're basically doing like on a daily basis [ __ ] somebody else
(2:09:12) because that's their job like I mean like it doesn't really matter how long they stay in it yeah but can you contend
(2:09:17) with my argument now well you're talking about sex workers correct yeah so what I said was the argument to me was it was
(2:09:24) this Andrew most of the time these people are hooking up with other people inside of the industry it's like well
(2:09:31) not really because they have a limited shelf life inside of that industry so most of them are good okay but normies
(2:09:37) right it's not a it's not a limited show no no no not at all I
(2:09:43) if if they're if you go into work every day right like um I don't know if you're retired or if you're still working in
(2:09:49) the job that you work in but like you go to work every day and you do your work there's these people are sex workers so
(2:09:56) they go into their work and they probably [ __ ] somebody every day that means if you go in like everything how
(2:10:02) many how many how many days a year do you think you work uh probably probably 300 days I would
(2:10:09) guess something okay so the name
(2:10:20) not necessarily saying that's the same person um I'm sure there's some crossover but
(2:10:27) like yeah okay so they probably got 300 body count you know give or take some Crossover with the same people whatever
(2:10:33) so what is that or not like a professional aspect to the
(2:10:39) fact that they have a high body count it would be a professional aspect that they have a high body count
(2:10:45) okay so then why are you acting like that's not maybe I'm unsure what your argument was clearly even though I just
(2:10:51) restated it twice for you do it a third time so here was the argument to me one
(2:10:58) more time the argument was gee Andy and Rachel uh most of the time inside of
(2:11:04) these industries these porn Industries people call you Andy can I
(2:11:09) connect so anyway so you don't want to hear the argument I don't want to hear the argument
(2:11:14) I've never heard 40 or something before I just thought it was I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't mean to row go
(2:11:20) ahead go ahead all people hang on let me make this clear let me make this clear on The Andy thing anybody who has never
(2:11:27) engaged in prostitution can always call me Andy okay wow what a dick she was nice to you
(2:11:33) too oh stop I'm not offended by it at all yeah you don't you don't know you don't
(2:11:39) know the Dynamics but anyway so so back back to where we were at the question
(2:11:44) that was posed uh about porn was are they dating inside of their own industry it's like maybe they are while they're
(2:11:50) in the industry that's probably every industry everybody works in they probably mostly date or pull out of their employee pool or whatever but the
(2:11:57) shelf life is very limited and you are going to have to contend with the fact that you were in porn at some point with
(2:12:02) whoever the Normie is that you end up with and most of them are going to end up with normies if they end up with anybody because they have a shelf life
(2:12:08) that's the point all right first of all they don't have a shelf life it's just like ending in like so for acting
(2:12:17) acting four years because you have so many people trying it for like maybe a few months or a year and then quitting
(2:12:22) and so that's going to bring the statistical average down as opposed to people who genuinely take this on as a
(2:12:28) career and I'd imagine the average person who genuinely takes its own career all I need to do it for maybe a
(2:12:33) decade maybe a decade and a half or two and the neighbor has a shelf life every single every career has a shelf life but
(2:12:40) I don't think that that porn industry like has a shelf life because you just got through saying that and then you refuted
(2:12:46) your own argument five seconds later and said every industry has a shelf life me because you don't make any sense in
(2:12:52) your arguments you don't literally make no sense I just showed you a performative contradiction you just made
(2:12:58) inside of three sentences you said porn stars have no no shelf life and then you
(2:13:03) go on to say in every industry everybody has a shelf life they both can't be true at the same time
(2:13:08) learn geometry Lord Jesus I didn't say
(2:13:14) porn stars themselves have like porn stars themselves just like any other industry like any other person like an
(2:13:21) engineer doesn't have a shelf life but people in general will leave after a
(2:13:27) certain amount of time because mathematically that's just you're going to have to have a number of averages
(2:13:32) eventually that's just how it works like a shelf life that's not a shelf life
(2:13:38) no not only is it not only is it a shelf life it's a perfect example so it's like milk right no calories
(2:13:45) an expiration yeah but but here's the thing even though it has what has an
(2:13:50) expiration date it can be utilized after the expiration date and still not be bad or sometimes it'll shower before the
(2:13:56) expiration date so what we do is we look at the expiration date and when generally it goes bad and when generally
(2:14:02) it doesn't and we say this is the shelf life of the milk just like we do with careers Lauren right so Engineers don't
(2:14:08) go bad after a certain amount of time but they do that their bodies break down not only do their bodies break down but
(2:14:14) their minds break down and they do have an average shelf life of work yes they do I don't know literally anybody has an
(2:14:21) average self-life I have said that yes and she agreed she agreed with that statement two minutes ago let's move on
(2:14:28) then it means nothing yeah so I have a question that gets more to the point of this can I can I kind of try to put it
(2:14:35) back on track so rather than talking about porn stars why don't we ask what
(2:14:41) would make so if you have a girl who sleeps with a different guy every weekend what do you think is making her do that
(2:14:48) that would not be problematic for a man who is considering you know a relationship with her it's what's behind
(2:14:55) like maybe he has been lonely she's been searching for hold on potentially she's
(2:15:01) dating these guys and if you're saying it's every weekend
(2:15:07) um maybe she is just really incapable of keeping a guy down and is not
(2:15:14) uh realizing that she should wait in a relationship in order to secure the
(2:15:20) man's interest for long like I said I'd have to like flip that argument in a way where it's like okay so what if a dude's
(2:15:27) doing that like what what I think it's just kind of a human condition to like maybe [ __ ] around a little bit but like
(2:15:32) is there a difference between a man doing it and a woman doing it
(2:15:39) uh Rachel can you answer that question like or maybe you can ask Andrew or or Alex here like Andrew and I have the
(2:15:46) exactly in question one that's a little bit Andrew and I didn't run this a little bit because he thinks I do think
(2:15:52) male chastity is important from a religious perspective because
(2:15:57) um you know like if you're Christian and you're trying to achieve sales this is important in that way but I think just like in a secular psychological sense I
(2:16:05) think that men have a biological imperative to spread the seed far and wide and I think that women have a
(2:16:10) biological imperative to uh secure resources and security because as the
(2:16:16) child Bears we are tied down with any infant we have for about two years because we're nursing we're kind of
(2:16:22) difficult right so I think so um it's not as big a deal for a guy to have a
(2:16:27) higher body count now would I want some guy who just bangs everything that moves no because that's just like gross and
(2:16:33) germy and like shows that he has no respect for himself but I do think that
(2:16:38) with a woman it is more important because we're The Gatekeepers of sex and we are the selectors of who gets to pass
(2:16:44) their genetics on that is true okay so um but then I have to ask you again
(2:16:51) the entire questions again um in the reverse where is it an issue
(2:16:56) for you if Andrew had you know had multiple partners I mean again you don't the answer is uncomfortable like I'm
(2:17:04) just as an example you don't have to say directly him but like you're you're hot obviously you're currently already married but like
(2:17:11) um Andrew when he was young was quite the
(2:17:17) panty dropper and there was always [ __ ] after him so it didn't bother me if anything it was like uh it kind of
(2:17:24) let me know that he's high value because all the women around were after him constantly so for and you know he was he was fairly
(2:17:31) selective but he wasn't you know I mean it was to me it was like okay this is
(2:17:37) this guy worth chasing after that's how I see it I know that's like incredibly based and most women will agree
(2:17:45) twice I was just constantly having to like fight off you know skanks all the time
(2:17:53) because he was attracted to escape how to fight them all huh
(2:17:59) so there was games and he was hanging out with no there was just always no it
(2:18:05) was like so he's he's a successful guy he had a good a very good job and so in
(2:18:10) his place of work he would have a rule that he would not eat lunch with anyone who was a woman he wouldn't be alone in
(2:18:17) any capacity with anyone who was a woman because they could see that he was good looking and had a really good job and
(2:18:23) probably made good money and these girls were like you know working the lower level job so they would kind of chase
(2:18:29) after him it was just like it's what women do women are hypergamous and if they see a guy who they think is a good
(2:18:34) provider who is high value guy they're going to go after him right so um occasionally have you done that
(2:18:40) Rachel me uh well I think that I secured a guy that's
(2:18:48) probably just slightly out of my lead yes if you've never met a guy that makes
(2:18:53) more money than Andrew no well I've never no I've never been able
(2:18:58) to date a guy who's more successful than Andrew now what have you had the option to shouldn't you by Nature do it then
(2:19:05) no because I've already picked him and we already have a full family
(2:19:12) no it would actually so my chances now at 43 years old first of all
(2:19:17) statistically if I were to divorce Andrew but if you have a chance but I wouldn't specifically have this
(2:19:24) but if you did yeah you're missing an appointment here
(2:19:33) yeah part of part of the nature yeah part of the nature of this thing is that
(2:19:38) the value structure is a Christian value structure and human beings are always fighting their nature male or or female
(2:19:45) just say just as males get tempted Often by females who often try to put them in compromises or things like that wait so
(2:19:53) is and so is it just always going to be this is it just always going to be yeah when's the last time x happened to you
(2:20:00) so what does this have to do with anything because he was the guy who made the most
(2:20:06) that you felt like well I mean nobody settled for you so
(2:20:21) don't worry about me sweetie yeah so even though I get what Rachel's
(2:20:28) this example of Andy being a high value man how many high value men do we have
(2:20:33) walking around that women have access to so saying that men having high body counts uh aren't actually an issue I
(2:20:40) don't see how that's actually like relevant to like the mass majority of men right well women always want the top 10 all of
(2:20:48) them think that they you know they're gonna shoot their shot for the highest you know 10 I'm sure Alex can tell you
(2:20:55) all about that
(2:21:04) more [ __ ] no I was saying that women are always chasing after the best guy they think
(2:21:12) they can get so it's relative right I am not I'm clearly not an Instagram model I am not in the top 10 of women looks wise
(2:21:18) so I had to compensate with other things like loyalty um and you know being black annoying
(2:21:26) being less annoying than other women things like that being a really good mom that was like a huge thing so I you can
(2:21:32) make sure I think you're beautiful I know Nina thank you but I'm very I'm
(2:21:38) realistic and I have eyeballs and I'm 43 years old now so you know like was I hotter when I was younger totally yeah
(2:21:46) wait let me try to answer Rachel's question so I do think that women
(2:21:51) generally want to look for the best possible partner I think men are exactly like that too I think human beings in
(2:21:58) general look for the best possible partner they can get but I do think one big thing the rebel Community misses is
(2:22:03) the concept of like investment uh so if you're like in a relationship like if you're in a relationship with a girl and
(2:22:09) she's happy and you're happy she's not gonna just like break up with you because the higher value guy comes along so investment counterbalances I guess
(2:22:17) hypergly but yeah that's just kind of my take anyway though then you would find what you
(2:22:24) would consider like the most high value men in society typically marrying 18
(2:22:29) year old virgin only fans models but if you look at the high value men in our society like Zucker Gates
(2:22:37) um musk other they don't tend uh muscular musk continually gets married to new
(2:22:43) people but they tend to go for women who are in their 30s or even their 40s uh
(2:22:49) coming oh Bloomberg um who is the other one I was thinking of like all the wealthiest men in the world tend to date
(2:22:56) older women who and sometimes previously divorced women so
(2:23:01) uh yeah that if your model doesn't actually apply to reality and then
(2:23:07) actually it does finding a lot of the times uh the people
(2:23:12) who push these models since for instance the red pill communities for instance Nico zurka Myron all of these men date
(2:23:19) women with extremely high body counts who have done only fans who so they and
(2:23:25) are not 18 and so the men who are pushing these ideologies are not even attracted to the woman they said say
(2:23:31) that all men should be attracted absolutely okay but this is the thing that you're
(2:23:36) kind of missing with that so like when you're talking about people like zerka zerka is literally insane God bless him
(2:23:46) he's crazy though you're right you're so crazy but I you know I'm I don't think
(2:23:51) there's anything you know I don't know I'm not hating on him I think he's pretty funny but I mean he these guys
(2:23:57) are living like a rock star life you know so they're not looking for wives and moms they're not settling down at
(2:24:02) all when you do look at men who marry and they're high status so like Robert De Niro has a far younger girlfriend
(2:24:09) right now uh Leonardo DiCaprio always he like checks girls to the curb once they
(2:24:15) hit like 23. and he gets yeah no matter how old he doesn't want to turn her into right
(2:24:21) exactly the high value men that marry other women tend to marry women who are
(2:24:27) in their early 30s maybe late 30s you know frequently once divorced wait what what happened to Andrew
(2:24:36) killed him his computer crashed he's getting it back up he just bought all
(2:24:41) the stuff to build a new one but the one he has right now is uh band-aided together at the moment let's do like uh
(2:24:48) five more minutes of this topic and then we'll move on to the uh after paranormal post show uh okay keep going
(2:24:55) it's all it's all ladies now except for go ahead Rachel do you
(2:25:04) [Music] do you think it's irresponsible for
(2:25:09) um is it both of them I remember Robert De Niro are one of them they're like incredibly old and like they're they're
(2:25:16) gonna die before their kids ever know them right do you do you feel that that's a little irresponsible for
(2:25:23) um them to be having children at the age that they're at
(2:25:28) it it I would say it's probably not ideal I don't know if you would say
(2:25:35) irresponsible I mean it's not ideal I think the statistics are super duper
(2:25:40) clear about uh fathers in the home being like a serious yeah like if they're
(2:25:45) gonna die it's kind of like the same thing right yeah I think it's probably not ideal no I mean I don't know if it's
(2:25:52) like morally wrong or maybe you could argue well we I mean wouldn't you argue that it's the same where it's like if we
(2:25:59) don't have the followers in the home like if they die because they're old like doesn't that seem at the same level
(2:26:04) of irresponsibility yeah but I think that men having children in their 70s
(2:26:10) and stuff is like really rare so I'm not super concerned about that but you think yeah do you think it's immoral though
(2:26:16) like I I kind of think it's kind of [ __ ] up personally I mean if it happens accidentally it happens accidentally sure whatever but I
(2:26:22) I think it was not that in this particular situation
(2:26:27) well I don't know but we were supposed to be talking about like how men should feel about women's body counts and I was
(2:26:34) my point was like okay if you're choosing a potential mother for your children do you want a woman who's got
(2:26:41) like you know a super high body count because especially nowadays if she is what is the takeaway model because if
(2:26:48) she's an only fan especially okay but what if she's not she just [ __ ] a lot of people she just like I look at Crazy
(2:26:55) Summer I think that I think divorce is risky enough for men these days without
(2:27:00) adding to the fact this woman clearly has like yes
(2:27:11) you're good if if a woman has a super high body count she clearly grants
(2:27:17) access very easily right the barber access has to be low that's not yeah
(2:27:23) Andy Annie wasn't wanting to say like what was a high body account what would you consider a high body count
(2:27:28) uh well it depends because I I think that if you don't get married by the
(2:27:35) time you're 30 like your odds of getting married at all drop off a cliff and if you get to 30 and you're not a virgin uh
(2:27:43) you're probably having a decent amount of Partners maybe not but if you're not it depends I'm just asking more of a
(2:27:49) number I love how this is not based on like yeah like what are you basing those up like do you have like a number
(2:27:55) because there's too many as you said earlier there's too many variables right so it depends on each of the person it
(2:28:01) depends on isolating variables have you heard of that yes I know what isolated burials
(2:28:09) everything is what would you think like like I mean like I don't again I don't want to delve
(2:28:15) too much into your personal life I know you're saying virginity is ideal and the less the
(2:28:22) better um I think if it's oh I would probably but this is the thing right it's
(2:28:28) arbitrary no matter what it's going to be someone arbitrary I have to ask you I have that hold on really really good
(2:28:35) Alex okay you're right it is arbitrary but the question is uh like according to
(2:28:42) your standards right so it is I do think it's important to give at least a ballpark because what could be a really
(2:28:48) high body count yeah it might to use the example that Alex
(2:28:55) put out if my son came to me and my son is 22 and he's dating a girl his same age I would say under five would be good
(2:29:04) if she's 22 because hopefully she hasn't been there for a second
(2:29:10) no like under five bodies if she's 22 years old would probably be good
(2:29:15) um but yeah there's like factors so again if you get to like 30 and you only have five that's pretty good you know it
(2:29:23) say you've been sexually active for 12 years you've only done it with five guys that's only one guy every two plus years
(2:29:29) if you are 18 and you've got a body count of 12 that's a problem
(2:29:35) I guess I I kind of Wonder like do we add the aspect of like how much are you [ __ ] the same per like if you're like
(2:29:42) with one person you're recording every single day like it's it's a different body so that's the thing is like how
(2:29:48) many different men are you granting Apple what's the difference it's a big difference because you are
(2:29:55) it's indicative of your ability to hold together a relationship it's indicative
(2:30:00) of your of your ability to Grant access to just whoever right so if you're a kind of girl original have you never
(2:30:06) wanted to just stay home every night yeah well my husband yeah
(2:30:12) I have never so I'm divorced I have everyone knows
(2:30:18) it wasn't advice it wasn't my choice um it wasn't my choice anyways uh so no
(2:30:25) I would have done literally anything to avoid that but unavoidable and out of respect for my ex who is still around
(2:30:31) I'm not going to like tell his business but it was not online yeah so but no I don't like I've never been
(2:30:39) one of these women that just has casual sex I've never done that the only people I've slept with I was in very long-term
(2:30:45) relationships with so I don't really get the whole just wanting to bang a stranger thing I think it's like it kind
(2:30:51) of creeps me out to be honest um well why why do you not understand that like you just never wanted to [ __ ]
(2:30:56) everyone's or have you always been with somebody I've only been single for like six months of my
(2:31:02) of my adults okay well that makes you always have been in a long-term relationship I've only ever been like in
(2:31:08) a really long-term like marriages basically um what if Andrew got hit by a car and
(2:31:16) he died Uh I that would probably be horrible of course let's let's probably be it for me
(2:31:22) unless some fantastic amazing person came along but I'm 43 I've already just
(2:31:27) want to like just [ __ ] somebody just like to get your rocks off or whatever maybe but like my I have values that
(2:31:34) don't allow me to just I mean he's dead you're not betraying him he's dead literally death but in in My Religion
(2:31:41) I'm an Orthodox Christian so we don't just randomly bang people like it would have to be it's supposed to be within
(2:31:48) the sacrament of marriage only um so at this point in my life as an Orthodox Christian who's has plenty of
(2:31:56) you know married sex uh no I don't just have The Sensational urge to just like collect
(2:32:02) sticks but we are kind of getting near the end I do have a quite a few questions I
(2:32:08) actually want to ask uh mainly Miss Wilson but uh I'll give like the two
(2:32:13) minute thing so if you guys have any points you want to make maybe Andrew could just come and hang out with you or something
(2:32:19) um I think he's getting it back up so I was just gonna I'm gonna go to say uh being that Lauren is a virgin LOL and
(2:32:27) then Nina has had an only fan so you're very Angela I'm a virgin too I've never
(2:32:33) had sex plenty of virgins I have heard that in from us uh me and my girlfriend we don't have
(2:32:38) sex we just look at each other like edging but partner form very hot
(2:32:46) very sexy I mean I love that for you and going back to this memories getting blah
(2:32:53) as we get later so I personally don't engage into Coco culture I don't under I don't agree with it but I know plenty of
(2:32:59) people do it it goes with like a certain lifestyle and I think it's normal for them culture
(2:33:05) excuse me you said you don't agree with her I don't agree with participating in it
(2:33:11) like it's not my gotcha gotch gotcha okay I can understand for I guess like the generation sure depending on like
(2:33:16) being in Miami meeting people who are active online streamers and and sex workers it's really normal and I think
(2:33:23) that there's this huge disconnect with people that watch this type of content not understanding
(2:33:28) Tom you're funny anyways uh yeah so listening to this
(2:33:34) conversation I can understand like I think there's a huge disconnect when we talk about body counts because Rachel's not here that five like normal up to
(2:33:41) like 30. somebody else that I talked to that's part of like the incel community would say that's too [ __ ] high uh
(2:33:46) Nina saying it's normal to be engaging in hookup culture somebody will say it's not so it's just again it goes back to
(2:33:52) saying like who exactly are we talking to we're saying is a high body count too high and I just really depends on who
(2:33:58) who the hell are we talking to because as somebody who works in a nail salon I gotta say like there's a bunch of old farts in there that are happy to date
(2:34:03) these [ __ ] on the bimbos and the yachts and they're completely fine after they're divorced they're fine those girls are rocking their [ __ ] life off
(2:34:10) in the hookup culture and it doesn't really matter so if we're talking about the young guys who don't have a choice but if you're asking them hey would you
(2:34:16) want a girl who hasn't had bodies a girl who has 20 50 bodies he's gonna choose obviously it's a nobodies because if
(2:34:21) you're not getting any bodies you're gonna make sure you're secure the one who isn't [ __ ] everybody I think that we're not really narrowing down who
(2:34:27) we're talking about and it's just too broad for me to like but if you just want to hear dig sucked you're gonna go with the one to most bodies because like
(2:34:34) yeah if you just want your dick they're gonna know what they want you know yeah but I think like if these guys are trying to secure hopefully a long
(2:34:41) lasting I don't know a body that continuously come around whenever he wants this has to be somebody who's like stable enough to want to be sleeping I
(2:34:48) will say this I did pull the chat and I asked which would you prefer a virgin or
(2:34:53) girl with five sexual partners 73 said a virgin
(2:35:01) Alex's chat let's go this is our point that there's a large
(2:35:06) portion in fact you said about 30 of the your chat
(2:35:13) said they want a virgin 27 one a non-virgin
(2:35:22) can you actually with a [ __ ]
(2:35:27) I think the answer is no I'll do it I'll do it for you Nina
(2:35:33) I'll do it for you you guys want a [ __ ] [ __ ] from some [ __ ] random
(2:35:38) [ __ ] never had a dick in their mouth like come on again what on Earth are you doing that
(2:35:44) you need
(2:35:53) I mean I remember being like a like younger person and like thinking like it was called sucking dicks I was just like
(2:36:00) literally sucking like it was a [ __ ] straw and that was probably the worst [ __ ] that everyone's ever ever gotten
(2:36:05) yeah you just said your poll like Alex this is this is your channel your channel is
(2:36:11) predominantly like a dating uh thing where a lot of these guys are struggling so they're gonna be picking virgins just
(2:36:17) I mean and which channel Angela I would actually expect it to be the opposite yeah like my chat maybe right heavily
(2:36:25) Christian I'm actually surprised by the responses because I would I've made
(2:36:30) countless videos where I said yo virgins are overrated uh I've hooked up with virgins not that pleasant but yeah I
(2:36:36) guess so now knowing that so now knowing that oh sorry go ahead no sorry but like Alex you're the Hilton store Channel
(2:36:42) that's your view you're teaching them so people that you're teaching obviously don't have the exact values you they
(2:36:47) have to be taught these things so they're going to be like holding strong of the fact that they want virgins because they can't even get a date with
(2:36:53) a girl so just to play it safe that's their first option but like they for example Stephen Crowder I really don't
(2:36:58) think he's gonna be picking another version someone who has experience or someone who's had Partners like Alex any other people who engage into hookup
(2:37:04) culture are gonna say hey I want someone who has a normal amount of bodies or bodies it doesn't bother them as opposed
(2:37:09) to getting a virgin Stephen Crowder's gonna be Stephen Crowder's gonna be picking a dude because he's gay
(2:37:15) true yeah now knowing this she's not knowing this
(2:37:20) I just straight guys don't send dick pics if you guys would modify your answer now when I asked the question if
(2:37:27) all things were equal between the two women uh if the exact same woman it's just you could have her before she had
(2:37:33) the body counter afterwards your mic went out I think you said
(2:37:40) before somebody had like a high body you had two identical women one half a body kind
(2:37:46) of five one had a body count nine which one was more preferable to the
(2:37:51) average dude and once again it's just preference based you're gonna have a group of men whether it might be a swipe
(2:37:57) would be though meaning above 50 that means almost
(2:38:04) nothing so yeah there's a group of men and maybe that group event is slightly larger for those who would want the
(2:38:10) Virgin but there's also a very large group of men that wouldn't prefer the Virgin it's a large group I agree but
(2:38:16) it's a minority in comparison to the average at least with this poll chat at 27 so I'm going to ask you again at
(2:38:23) least based on this poll chat and these are degens which do you think they'd prefer because they just told you
(2:38:29) depends on the person and maybe maybe more men would choose the Virgin but
(2:38:35) there's a large group of men who would prefer not the virgin I mean I I I've taken like a dues
(2:38:41) virginity like and it's like they [ __ ] suck like it's like whatever but I like the person so it was like fine
(2:38:47) but like it just like I don't understand why that would be appealing yeah Alex I
(2:38:53) hope these Nina how many how many different dicks do you have to suck in order to figure out how that works
(2:38:59) I want to turn the question around the question that you've asked like 10 times that makes no sense that just shows that
(2:39:06) your lack of relationship and then your issues in your own life but anyway I'm
(2:39:11) asking Nina because she everybody needed to know for me how many body counts no
(2:39:16) go ahead and ask your question so you know that like in order to be good at sex you have to have a lot of different
(2:39:23) men to have sex with like why can't you practice with the same person to get good at sex why do you sure know you
(2:39:29) absolutely the same person you need to have sex with different dudes you don't have to okay that's
(2:39:37) awesome I think like just having more sexual experience you know Lauren you're a virgin you can't comment on the phone
(2:39:43) numbers argument she's just saying that it you
(2:39:49) just need to experience that experience could be with one partner but if you're a virgin we have experience right but
(2:39:55) just just having one partner could give you as much experience as a girl with 20 bodies right it just comes down to yeah
(2:40:01) I I still think they're mutually exclusive like I absolutely agree with that what you're saying and it's just like I just think like somebody having
(2:40:07) experience I think is probably a pretty good thing especially if you're interested in like having some like good
(2:40:13) [ __ ] sex like if you're talking about a relationship then the body count shouldn't matter right like the this
(2:40:18) seems immaterial if we're just talking about having a relationship with somebody I don't think the relationship
(2:40:24) aspect of this would or body count I guess to keep with the premise should at
(2:40:29) all Impact what type of relationship you can have but if we're talking about sex like I think that it would actually kind
(2:40:36) of be a you know a little bit of a buff there because they probably know what the [ __ ] they're doing but to steal man
(2:40:41) then the other side uh the debate is kind of anything so I feel like I can
(2:40:46) get involved a little bit more Nina I just I was just curious though um do you do you like tell them where you learned were you learned all the
(2:40:54) tricks you tell them where you learned all the tricks yeah
(2:41:01) let me ask the question then you can ask yourself
(2:41:06) man what Rachel is saying is that a girl with a high body count doesn't that signal that she might have other
(2:41:14) characteristics that are incompatible for a long-term relationship like she could be very novelty driven like she
(2:41:19) could be afraid of commitment like she could have some emotional trauma so maybe it's not directly the body count
(2:41:25) that's making her less uh suitable for a long-term partner it's all the other things that are associated with it
(2:41:32) absolutely but the the thing I would say is that applies to both ends of it if you're talking about like on both
(2:41:38) Partners like I I don't think those are independently related to like women or
(2:41:45) men I think that it's just yeah that that absolutely can be indicative of those things and that's why you should
(2:41:50) get to know somebody but I don't think that means because they have a high body count that means that that is a factor
(2:41:57) um but you're right that that is a possibility but that's why you get to know somebody of course in a
(2:42:02) relationship right okay let's let Andrew ask this question go ahead yeah I was just curious when you're talking about
(2:42:08) how you're going to have the most bombastic sex ever do you tell your partner where you learned your trick you'd be like well Fred taught me that
(2:42:14) one is that is that something which comes up in the course or do you think maybe they wouldn't want to know you
(2:42:19) think maybe they would be like ah you know I really don't want to hear about you and Fred having sex and that's where you learn how to do that thing I'm
(2:42:25) asking you Nina this question no I don't I think that would be your that's like a really psychotic thing to say like
(2:42:31) nobody would say that right and why do you think that they wouldn't want to know that information you know I have no idea you have no idea you just
(2:42:39) just because they wouldn't you said it's a psychotic
(2:42:47) would it be why is it that you think that they really asking me hey how did you learn how to suck dick no I'm just
(2:42:53) asking you I'm just asking you what are you asking me they're like do you do you ever tell your partner like oh yeah I
(2:42:59) learned that from Chuck and Fred and John well I mean why wouldn't you don't do
(2:43:05) you think you want to hear it to then comment on the like Nina's side
(2:43:10) it would be like your wife telling you about a big [ __ ] she took like so my whole um
(2:43:20) my whole point here is to this point which is he doesn't want to [ __ ] hear about it why do you think he doesn't
(2:43:26) want to hear about it I didn't I'm not telling him would you think that he wouldn't want to
(2:43:33) hear about it why would you why do you think that that would be the response I'm not talking about it are you constantly talking about answer my
(2:43:40) question don't ask me a question to answer my question just answer my questions you have to say what you're
(2:43:45) saying I don't understand why do I think that he doesn't know about you're asking about hypothetical on something that it's like why do you think he wouldn't
(2:43:51) want to know that information why do you think I'm asking you I'm asking you 50
(2:43:57) times why don't you tell me you don't think that it's because the person who you're in a relationship with doesn't
(2:44:03) want to think about former sexual partners because it's revolting well you at least
(2:44:09) that's what every man thinks but that's when you unless there's a Croc Andrews
(2:44:14) right yeah that is that is so but you think that because
(2:44:20) more and more and more dudes that you have sex with and you think though that even though the apartment
(2:44:27) Nina you think that permanently all right having sex with tons of dudes that
(2:44:34) this is not going to be revolting every single dude you add to the list of course it is well let me ask you this
(2:44:40) why no it's not
(2:44:47) right why for the same reason that if you were to volunteer whatever the sex sexual
(2:44:54) intercourse you had with another man was to the man you're currently engaged to in some way whether it's
(2:45:00) um maybe even if it's a fling they probably don't want to hear that because it's revolting to them to think that
(2:45:06) somebody else is banging their chick it's revolting to almost another man only banging their checks so why is it
(2:45:12) when it comes to the Past what's the issue this is what's intuitive right they
(2:45:19) don't want to hear about it because their intuition tells them this is revolting so if men's intuition is
(2:45:25) telling him it's revolting you've been with other men I don't even want to think about the fact that you've been with other men that's a bad thing that
(2:45:30) you've been with other men it probably lowers your value to most men you see how that works
(2:45:40) here I I don't think there need to be a why why can't it just be a preference
(2:45:46) chicks like call dudes why go ahead I love you but please ask away
(2:45:53) why why what why are they revolted by it likely because of a combination of
(2:46:01) factors one of the combination of factors being that psychologically inside of men it's a red flag when women
(2:46:08) have had multiple sexual partners and they don't they clearly don't want to think about it another reason is virtues
(2:46:14) another I'm giving you multiple reasons okay right and by the way don't ask me why
(2:46:20) say why and then a specific question stop you don't need to do this whole thing okay so that that's two right
(2:46:26) there do you have any refutations to either of those no I want to ask you why I just answered both the your questions
(2:46:33) you just named other things and then you didn't explain them I did explain them
(2:46:39) would you do you want a further explanation please repeat that revolted they're revolted by the fact that you
(2:46:46) have been sleeping with other men because it has a psychological red flag impact on them so when they think about
(2:46:53) it what is like the red flag is that if they're thinking about you having sex with other men and they're revolted by
(2:46:59) it that's the red flag what is the red flag who's who's red flagged and the woman or the man
(2:47:06) well before the man the woman would be red flagged so it's a red flag for the man to see
(2:47:14) that the woman is a like a red flag
(2:47:19) that literally didn't make any sense Nina well I don't know you're the one that explained it that way I mean no
(2:47:24) like to be fair it's like very simply it's just revolting it's like hearing about your girlfriend taking it why why
(2:47:30) is it revolting okay oh that's fair that's fair okay then let's just go online do I why is there a neuroscientific reason why it's
(2:47:37) revolting I know that it's revolting well tell me your opinion we're I'm talking to you
(2:47:43) I think that uh it offers up massive red flags and that promiscuity is a turn off
(2:47:49) it's revolting because there's red flags promiscuity is a turn off to most men so
(2:47:55) if you're promiscuous no I'm asking you and I'm telling you literally telling you the answer to your
(2:48:01) question Nina okay so promiscuity is a red flag for men the more promiscuous
(2:48:06) you are the less loyal that you think you are including me yes of course promiscuity is a big red flag for me
(2:48:11) don't like promiscuous women never like promiscuous we're going to like promiscuous women because I find it revolting that women have tons of sexual
(2:48:19) partners that's why okay but why would it okay you need to understand like I'm trying to I'm trying
(2:48:25) to have you like go down the path here you're saying that well then you need to ask questions other than why I am
(2:48:33) I think it's pretty clear what I'm gonna say why and then ask the question
(2:48:38) why do you find it revolting multiple sexual partners because it's intuitive
(2:48:44) because okay why is it intuitive I think he's awesome because it's part
(2:48:49) because it's part of my ontological being that it's intuitive that's why I
(2:48:54) need it how I could not give you a better answer
(2:49:00) that's the most specific answer I could possibly give you why do you fonder
(2:49:05) revolting if you watch a puppy getting kicked in front of you why is that revolting for you because I find the
(2:49:10) loss of the life of a puppy um upsetting right it goes against what you value
(2:49:17) well and for Andrew no I can actually answer that question instead of like dodging around it like Andrew's doing I
(2:49:23) don't think I can answer it how could how did I die kid no I need you to tell me how I dodged this I was the most used
(2:49:31) to tell me how I dodged because that was your application no I want you to tell me how he died
(2:49:37) I just feel like I didn't get a good question of like yourself which part was not answered
(2:49:43) like literally none of it like I was asking you why do you feel this way and
(2:49:48) then you wouldn't answer as to why you just kind of kept okay let's let's let Rachel give her Rachel please yeah so if
(2:49:57) something is cheap and easy to get is it valuable yes oh my God no it's not by definition
(2:50:05) yeah an electricity valuable yes water water and electricity are
(2:50:13) actually not cheap and easy to get you know that's what I I have to have any idea what it takes
(2:50:20) because Nina can tell you all about it give it away
(2:50:25) do you mean valuable in a personal level or by like literally like monetary
(2:50:30) material and metaphysical here's a good example if you want the ten dollar purse from
(2:50:36) Target or do you want the 800 Birkin bag which is more valuable to people
(2:50:44) all right all right I don't know how much this [ __ ] cost okay the expensive designer
(2:50:50) [Applause] notice by the way that neither of you
(2:50:55) answered the question uh
(2:51:13) I don't know I don't like I don't like expensive [ __ ]
(2:51:30) my whole point is is that if something is cheap and easy to get it goes down in
(2:51:35) value and if it is in high demand and difficult to get it goes up in value that's how things work I think those are
(2:51:42) I think those are additional reasons but I think the Crux of it is that for Andrew and I think Rachel uh having sex
(2:51:49) comes with a certain level of uh emotional inclusivity and just exclusivity in general so for them it's
(2:51:56) like they're having sex with people they care about in their world view and so to imagine your partner that you care about
(2:52:03) that you see a future with that you might get married to or are married to talking about having sex with another
(2:52:09) person is just repugnant and repulsive because they envisioned that person to
(2:52:15) be sexually exclusive with them and they're being reminded so I kind of like a slap in the face like oh yeah well I
(2:52:21) [ __ ] this guy but Alex why
(2:52:27) uh human nature I guess in your world yeah but why I imagine you would have like hang on Alex but why though are you
(2:52:35) trying to mean the fact that I asked you why yeah when I'm still Manning you wait why
(2:52:46) [Laughter] you know you know
(2:52:53) this was an extremely extremely um well done advertisement that did
(2:53:00) really well and sold a lot of cars for reviews BMW and you can't read it but it shows a very pretty girl and then the
(2:53:06) tagline is you know you're not the first but do you care and it's a it's a used
(2:53:11) car advertisement that does very well because men get the concept that you might not care if she's a first if she's
(2:53:18) that [ __ ] hot that's not why I did well didn't do well because this chick is
(2:53:25) being marketed as being pre-fucked it did well because it's funny and so therefore it's memorable
(2:53:30) it's funny because it's true you wouldn't yes the ultimate irony is what makes it
(2:53:39) makes it hilarious right is that it's ironic it's ironically not true because
(2:53:45) you do care no you don't because it's for you you do
(2:53:50) that's what makes it funny is the irony that's literally what makes it funny is the irony yes it is
(2:53:58) that you wouldn't get the joke
(2:54:05) than women women
(2:54:11) just introduce one piece of data to this so I did the poll you asked me for Anita and you are actually correct it was also
(2:54:17) pretty different so for a [ __ ] would you prefer a virgin 52 said a virgin and
(2:54:24) uh 48 said a girl with a five body count so the results on that were slightly
(2:54:29) different yeah slightly everybody knows that men will just pump and dump hoes
(2:54:35) and they marry girls who are have a higher bar for Access and no matter how
(2:54:41) much these girls want to cope no matter how much these girls yeah
(2:54:48) men don't like hoes except for to use them
(2:54:55) use them and throw them away like Kleenex not for white themes you're
(2:55:00) coping pretty hard and not bringing data I mean like a man I mean people presented I literally have not presented
(2:55:07) any data where what is the data where is it the divorce rate where are they
(2:55:15) show me all the hoes getting wiped up faster than girls
(2:55:21) look up that exact word where where where are they which study you want you the interview
(2:55:28) on it about how it dips
(2:55:42) that men want hoes you're trying to tell us men would rather marry hoes than they
(2:55:48) would not follow me Rachel your husband was calling me a
(2:55:53) [ __ ] because I have a uh only fans no I wasn't calling you before I said you engaged you were literally specifically
(2:55:59) called me a horned oh that would that would mean a hooker I said prostitute
(2:56:04) sure whatever does it really matter it matters because one's engaging in Sex and the other one's prostituting
(2:56:09) themselves Patterson because he's autistic so that he matters on his addiction
(2:56:15) I'm sorry listen I'm sorry intelligence upset you hey okay
(2:56:23) says that you have a small dick or that you don't know
(2:56:28) whatever yeah I get it um anyways moving on um do you think that it's unfair for
(2:56:34) your husband to say I said I probably do think he's gay
(2:56:39) based off what the woman looks like who he married we're all gay it's okay
(2:56:48) already married and had five kids and had a successful life and you're 29 and alone because nobody's playing the sound
(2:56:55) of your voice you've been married how many times you guys both literally fell next thing I've been married twice
(2:57:02) as many times you should debate me one-on-one and I
(2:57:09) will end you I will completely terminate your online career
(2:57:17) off
(2:57:33) I didn't but anyways what are we saying
(2:57:40) um don't ever hire this person to be your
(2:57:47) lawyer holy [ __ ] she can't argue her way out of a paperback what are you what's your educational
(2:57:53) background uh well I'm a best-selling author best selling does that count yeah I have
(2:58:01) a best-selling book yes it was on Tucker Carlson yeah she was on Tucker Carlson
(2:58:06) as well what about you though before he got fired
(2:58:12) my most important accomplishment is Raising five fabulous human beings what's your book called It's called
(2:58:18) occult feminism what's your book called not a literary person right so you
(2:58:25) haven't written a book you haven't done anything of notes you're not married Andrew have you written you're an imbecile you can't argue you think that
(2:58:31) argument structure has to do with geometry
(2:58:37) a geometry and argument structure I love it y'all are all smart people let's move on
(2:58:45) to the after panel uh any last everyone can make a fish
(2:58:50) closing statement if they want to we're not uh Lauren I would love to
(2:58:56) okay you start yeah Lauren's Googling my book
(2:59:03) so she can find some troll reviews and try to like talk some [ __ ] but that's fine everybody can see what happened
(2:59:09) here and uh what happened is giant Coke from Lauren about uh you know men
(2:59:17) actually would rather marry uh girls who are kind of hoes uh there's no data
(2:59:24) proving that body counts matter um I wish I would have gotten to argue no fault divorce with her because she
(2:59:31) was wrong about a lot of stuff there that's kind of my jam it's my specialty this is my she was asking about my
(2:59:37) educational background and this is it but um what what Lauren has done here
(2:59:45) is just devolve into total this is what happens anytime uh that I debate a woman for the first time they have absolute
(2:59:52) emotional breakdown the resort to name uh she doesn't have any arguments her
(2:59:58) closing yeah it's my closing you can just shut your mouth um but she's not used to me he's not
(3:00:05) used to being told no she's not used to having anybody not tell her oh sweetie you're so smart I'm so wonderful I don't
(3:00:13) think I think it's not your panel Nina
(3:00:22) yeah 15 seconds there was no argument here Andrew did not need any help to do
(3:00:27) this I just wanted to jump in because it was just so it was like nails on a chalkboard except for Angela Angela was
(3:00:34) nice Nina's fair at least Nina's fair but um no there was no Andrew absolutely
(3:00:40) completely single-handedly demolished this whole thing what the [ __ ] I don't get a compliment Alex you were a great
(3:00:46) moderator that's adorable you saying that and I do and I do love you Rachel but yeah I think Lauren had some songs I
(3:00:54) need validation every 20 minutes so I can feel good okay Alex you're great we love you let's let's go to
(3:01:00) um Angela and then we'll go and Andrew will wrap it up okay Angela yeah so as I
(3:01:06) stated I the body count conversation I find it highly irritable I just think that there's no way to really measure
(3:01:11) uh what is high I think it depends on who we're talking about and what you do on your day-to-day basis and depending
(3:01:18) on who you are and what's your preference and I think that yes if we're going through the extreme and say an average guy wouldn't want to grow as
(3:01:24) like a body kind of like 50 or 60 when he's only had one or two yeah that's a
(3:01:29) huge extreme obviously but um I just think it's these conversations are just so extreme so yeah I wanted to
(3:01:35) be combative and annoying but I couldn't do it because I couldn't find something that I solely agree on because there's no way to measure these things and uh
(3:01:43) yeah that's pretty much it all right Nina
(3:01:49) oh this is all messy um I I just think that um obviously my best friends uh Andrew and Rachel uh
(3:01:57) it's hard to always argue at them um but I think Lauren had some really good points going into this
(3:02:03) um I think that it's really stupid to think that somebody's value is based off of their sexual experiences and as a bad
(3:02:10) thing because honestly you ever been with somebody who can make you come feels really [ __ ] bad dude I would be
(3:02:18) pretty [ __ ] pogged out to have a dude that like is able to like make you come immediately like I don't understand like
(3:02:25) what this argument is about like oh I want something less experience the only thing that I could possibly think of of
(3:02:31) somebody wanting somebody's less experiences because they're insecure they don't understand how to do it and
(3:02:37) they don't want to learn it just seems like some dumbass like ego [ __ ] where like
(3:02:43) um I'm I'm really worried that like some other chick got [ __ ] down harder than I
(3:02:50) could possibly do and I think it's pathetic and it's for [ __ ] losers Nina I'll introduce you my man Ben
(3:02:56) Thorpe he's uh hell you're so mean no I would
(3:03:06) I would be a benthorpe like camera that if it spots him near your property it automatically calls the call Andrew has
(3:03:12) been very explicit about the fact that he doesn't want to be on the panel I told you I I am not going to be on a
(3:03:18) panel with him or Grace anymore okay Lauren you're next
(3:03:25) um I think that it's hard to isolate the variables of body count and if we're looking at this
(3:03:32) from a scientific perspective our or if we're saying that men in general prefer
(3:03:37) something um you're negating uh how small that Minority or how large that Minority
(3:03:43) might be because maybe the minority is just 48 so if you're trying to paint things as a pretty brush of men in
(3:03:49) general prefer things uh we're we're really not talking about
(3:03:54) men we're not really we're excluding a large portion of men and we're not talking about the reality of the world
(3:04:01) that we live in furthermore the people that that pushed the propaganda and the
(3:04:07) ideology that men only want virgins are not the ones who are end up dating virgins even Andrew on this panel has
(3:04:13) married somebody who has previously been married and had her husband leave her for whatever reason so he he's not
(3:04:21) choosing a virgin in his life and yet he's saying that men prefer virgins so it The Men Who propagate this propaganda
(3:04:28) don't even uh live to their own values and he's a perfect example
(3:04:34) okay let's let Andrew go when I say the word stupid I need you to understand
(3:04:40) exactly what I'm talking about take this [ __ ] above me who claims that my
(3:04:47) argument was that I wanted to have a virgin which wasn't my argument but
(3:04:53) rather that if you were to go to most men including me and say would you
(3:04:58) prefer the same woman with less bodies or more bodies or more bodies shut up it's my closing or more bodies they
(3:05:06) would tend to prefer the woman with the lower body count this was demonstrated in the poll Angela or I'm not sorry
(3:05:13) Lauren uh once again straw man me he done it this entire panel has no idea
(3:05:18) what she's talking about now Nina I don't I don't you know like we're always going to go back and forth because she's a blood sport debater and so am I we've
(3:05:25) been throwing hands for a long time online and we're going to keep on doing it it's brutal blood Sports we've done
(3:05:31) it on The Crucible for a long time and it's going to continue to happen it was nice to meet Angela Knight but Lauren
(3:05:36) listen unequivocally you are one of the dumbest human beings I've ever talked to
(3:05:41) in my life I've ever talked to you it is even
(3:05:48) though it's very personal it is this closing statement yeah you said when you
(3:05:53) said geometry I couldn't make good argument structures based on when I was
(3:05:58) in school I went and took geometry classes that was literally the dumbest
(3:06:03) thing anybody has ever said to me in my life there has never been a thing which
(3:06:08) has been said to me which was dumber than that and what was it before in Geometry then okay Lauren since he went
(3:06:14) after you personally I will give you a quick response go ahead what was your score in Geometry then
(3:06:19) oh my God I can't believe you just doubled down I can't believe that you just doubled down I don't think you did
(3:06:25) very well because I don't think you're good at logic structure I'll say I did I did dog send geometry like a c
(3:06:31) - Mathis for nerds all right anyway so let's move on to the after panel and
(3:06:38) read a few super chats uh appreciate everyone for the support uh salutes to
(3:06:44) the Chan panel thank you thank you thank you if there's a Super Chat that's very demeaning to one of the guests I will
(3:06:49) not read it but I still appreciate you guys donating if it's to me you can read it men are generally virtuous and
(3:06:55) forgiving would you would you single woman on pound be open turning to Christianity repenting for your sins uh
(3:07:01) question for the girls I guess um that's a [ __ ] [ __ ] statement um yeah you think that Christianity is
(3:07:08) like what like female or uh positive for women like [ __ ] you you're an idiot
(3:07:15) all right oh wow dude if this person genuinely wants
(3:07:23) women to be prevented from like expressing themselves sexually then why isn't he promoting all women become
(3:07:29) Muslim and cover themselves in tarps why Christianity why stop there why
(3:07:34) allow us to show our hair why wait a second why is that the argument why is that problematic
(3:07:41) I have nothing against Christianity but he's saying that like in order to be virtuous and like
(3:07:48) non-promiscuous and yet Christianity wouldn't be the most extreme I guess
(3:07:54) but why would that be the requirement though Lauren yeah but her job ruthlessness of a woman come on I don't
(3:08:00) understand how that would be why is why is the Muslims the standard for virtues I don't understand
(3:08:07) more preventative of promiscuity than Christianity Christianity allows women
(3:08:12) to show their hair to show more skin it's not as repressive for women so if
(3:08:18) you're saying that women need to repent for their sins because like promiscuity is a sign showing your face is
(3:08:24) promiscuous Lauren that's weird this first time I've ever heard that I've been very tempted looking at all this
(3:08:30) hair and faces I've never heard that before showing your face is promiscuous by law Andrew you're being pretty big
(3:08:36) brainstorm big brain stuff
(3:08:41) for camera I can't even figure out how to work a laptop if he thinks he's big brain
(3:08:48) I'm just kidding we love you Rachel I don't I don't have a laptop what are you talking about your desktop just [ __ ]
(3:08:54) up yeah my dad my desktop crashed oh no that's never happened to anybody in the history
(3:09:07) anyway why don't we just accept the fact that most religious and chess people launch ass is he trying to say
(3:09:16) chased or chase what does that mean really it means like
(3:09:22) um like having Chastity like being yeah chased
(3:09:34) keeping to yourself keeping uh tight it comes uh but like having like a tragedy
(3:09:40) belt is I don't I don't think anyone's disputing their religious people watching if you want to date another
(3:09:47) religious person right that's kind of what they're asking like if it's a religious person Chase means reserved it
(3:09:53) means reserved that's what it is having Chastity exactly
(3:09:59) no see how I didn't put the word in the definition and yeah a lot of times if you go so
(3:10:12) apparently does the dictionary does the dictionary
(3:10:18) does it say JUMP means to jump is that what it says
(3:10:25) it'll say it means to the verb form of Oh you mean a reference to
(3:10:32) definitely in yeah I know but the definition which is what I said making her Dumber
(3:10:38) will it reference a definite dumb because I'm higher educated than both of you and you guys can't handle it
(3:10:49) is
(3:10:59) really serving you tell she's so
(3:11:05) I have a lot of things I have a degree in psychology
(3:11:10) [Laughter]
(3:11:31) [ __ ] up all right geez Nina you seem upset why
(3:11:37) don't you calm down well you're being rude to Alex
(3:11:43) it's life Nina relaxation
(3:11:48) all right anyway Let's uh we're gonna bring on a few people uh I'll probably go for another 15-20 minutes I actually
(3:11:55) wrote down some questions as well that I was gonna ask but let's first go through the people uh okay Ashley how's it going
(3:12:01) hey how's it going I just want to say I love you Ashley Angela how are you doing
(3:12:09) I'm learning I feel like I'm learning everybody right now this is fun
(3:12:15) I'm doing good Nina I'm not gay but I'd be gay for you Lauren you have beautiful hair Rachel you are such a cold [ __ ] I
(3:12:24) love it Andrew cannot cannot wait I thought of you tomorrow night on this very subject Alex
(3:12:31) is your compliment coming for me okay Ashley you love me come on I do love you
(3:12:38) you know he said that the first time I debate a chick like it's always brutal seriously
(3:12:46) so guys the very first debate I ever had in my entire life my entire life let
(3:12:52) alone YouTube it was with this [ __ ] this [ __ ] right here at one point during the debate Rachel
(3:12:58) goes Rachel goes what the [ __ ] is this your first debate and I said Yes
(3:13:05) actually
(3:13:10) thank you so much really funny because
(3:13:17) it's like well you're full of yourself your son very pretentious and I was like well you need to put a bra on and brush
(3:13:22) your hair going back and forth it was really funny and then at the end it was
(3:13:27) the infamous like I do have great tits they should never have to do whatever it's brawless or Flawless in my opinion
(3:13:35) [ __ ] yeah dude yeah bras are for people who want to hurt their back for the
(3:13:41) patriarchy let them free keeps them perky too
(3:13:53) uh what's up Nick how you doing man hey can you hear me
(3:14:03) from everybody that pops in or are you gonna do some like the lifts or what no
(3:14:08) I'm post workout right now I think I'm done you're gonna do it being in a gym and you're not gonna do any lips
(3:14:15) it's the normal stick but not right now right now can I get like like a like a one like like a
(3:14:20) barbell Oh no just like I want I want you to lift something of some size Nina are you
(3:14:28) ovulating
(3:14:44) it's a question and a statement I guess yeah I just wanted to say I think it's really cool BBF that like um you defied
(3:14:51) the norm insofar as deciding to marry someone uh who I assume previously had a body count coming out of like a previous
(3:14:57) marriage I think that's really cool of you because I think that generally speaking like men of character Chaz if
(3:15:03) you will basically live their life based on um their own understanding of the world right like the what they observe and the
(3:15:11) decisions that they kind of like reap out of it you know what I mean so if you meet a woman that you think is beautiful and of good character that will make a
(3:15:18) good wife for you you pick them you don't base that off of a statistic only an idiot would do that right that's something called ecological fallacy when
(3:15:26) you apply a broad statistic to all individuals like we don't make decisions now way so I think it's really cool of
(3:15:31) you to do that and I'm really happy for you guys that you you know you didn't make a stupid decision based on a statistic and lose out on your you know
(3:15:38) like if you want to use soul mate whatever flowers are really nice way of putting our points I genuinely
(3:15:43) appreciate that you explain what something is after you say it because it helps I'm being dead ass
(3:15:51) for us that was like a nice way of saying that's in my point but like in the
(3:15:59) nicest possible way in a way it's like why would you why would you rely on body
(3:16:05) count as a reason to value a woman when you could actually meet the woman and see that she's very valuable despite
(3:16:12) whatever her previous history is and she would make a great mother based off of attribute attributes that you noticed
(3:16:18) from her from interacting with her as opposed from trying to dig into your history and seeing how many dicks she
(3:16:24) sucked as yeah exactly and like biblically like we even have the example of Mary Magdalene right who is a
(3:16:29) prostitute and becomes one of Jesus's most about followers if he had character if you had faith and that was more important go off Queen
(3:16:35) uh
(3:16:42) Marina and to a small extent Lord you are straw Manning the opposition
(3:16:49) um I don't think they're saying that body count is the only thing that matters and that's what you should uh
(3:16:54) focus on or that it's like the fact that she has more dicks in her which is makes
(3:17:00) her less suitable I think what she's saying I don't answer them and I think this is I think it comes down to uh in your
(3:17:08) videos this isn't that your point I think a lot of them are saying that it's about uh risk mitigation like lowering
(3:17:14) the wrist at the end of the day if a girl has a body a hundred she's more likely to be highly novelty driven she's
(3:17:22) more likely to happen yeah which means she's seeking like next dopamine high
(3:17:28) but why would you base anything on probability when you're when you're meeting these people one-on-one so you
(3:17:34) get to make these determinations about their characteristics
(3:17:46) probably got a high blood account because she she likes novelty [ __ ] she like I I think mostly they're pretty
(3:17:52) upfront about these type of things no I mean first of all I think that uh it depends so for girls census that
(3:17:59) you're the kind of guy that really cares about it and she wants to have a relationship with you she has every incentive to lie or at least minimize it
(3:18:06) significantly okay so men do the same time sure but it doesn't change the fact that
(3:18:11) yeah I agree that men do that I'm just saying that women oh my God your dog or something we're discussing women right
(3:18:17) now so yeah it's like it's like about risk mitigation you don't have a crystal ball you don't know what actually the
(3:18:24) girl's true intentions are there's a lot of things you can go off like is she does she seem like she's loyal but she
(3:18:29) seem like she's is this really gender-based though it just seems like that goes on both sides well let's let's
(3:18:34) be straight we mitigate we met it we make risk mitigating decisions on the
(3:18:40) basis of Investigation right and a really weak level of Investigation would be looking at a statistic that's not
(3:18:46) like uh involved with anything else about the person a really high level of Investigation would be you date the
(3:18:51) person you suss out their character you see what their values are and then you make decisions based on that like that's why why we date people right like even
(3:18:58) if you want to come back that's why we Court people is your parents are trying to figure out if this person seems legit if they're worth worth your while or
(3:19:04) whatever Nick yeah when you have Mary Kyle for body count was 200
(3:19:10) um if yeah if her body count was 200 now I'll be nuanced about it so if her body count was if her body count uh was 200
(3:19:18) and she had had some kind of like uh figurative not literal come to Jesus moment and she was like you know I think
(3:19:24) I was kind of like chasing like crazy whims back then and I was engaging in behavior that like wasn't super safe for me but I've kind of changed I've seen
(3:19:30) the importance in uh like delaying gratification then I'd be like all right yeah you learned something from your
(3:19:35) walk on this Earth and I think you're probably better for it but if that wasn't the case if she
(3:19:41) didn't have some kind of come to Jesus moment then that would be a deal breaker for you so in this case the come to Jesus moment is she's acts super crazy
(3:19:48) and uh does a risk-seeking behavior all the time no let's just say that you don't know
(3:19:54) like she seems cool she seems chill but her body count is let's go more extreme her body count is 500 and she hasn't had
(3:20:01) any kind of come to Jesus moment she hasn't realized that you know she's seeking validation would you still
(3:20:07) consider marrying her yeah so somehow in in this in this crazy hypothetical if
(3:20:12) this didn't generalize to how she acted or how she was in any other way then yeah it's fine but in reality yeah yeah
(3:20:18) that's the point is that being that promiscuous change is who you are as a person I disagree with you there and I
(3:20:25) also think there's a glaring like elephant in the room that no one's talked about yet but I'm Gonna Save that one for tomorrow no say it say it you
(3:20:32) can't just drop that what's the elephant
(3:20:45) Okay the reason the reason it matters uh potentially is because it comes it's
(3:20:51) correlated with a whole other behaviors they're not suitable for long-term partner like for example being highly
(3:20:57) novelty uh highly novelty driven like uh having validation seeking uh issues like
(3:21:04) for example having some emotional issues there's a whole girls generally don't [ __ ] 2 000 dudes unless they have some
(3:21:12) issues who has been raped shouldn't be able to have a good relationship with somebody
(3:21:17) because they have trauma
(3:21:22) let me cook let me cook here of course you would make an exception for rape I'm not saying the girl has to
(3:21:28) be a virgin okay but it's obviously a situation where it's um something that
(3:21:34) is different and is a trauma aspect of it
(3:21:40) where they're obviously more vulnerable to a particular situation do you think that that's like a situation that like
(3:21:45) oh because it's like more difficult that that's like a problem or what do you mean like I can't debate women wait but
(3:21:51) because they were raped and they haven't they were more susceptible to like sleeping with more men after that
(3:21:57) experience over and over and that's why they're both or just because they were raped in general I just wanted to clear
(3:22:03) I'm just like a particular drama and then maybe that they yes I think basically what Ashley was saying is
(3:22:08) exactly what I was getting at where it was just like maybe they were now less like like they were violated you know
(3:22:16) maybe that was their first experience unfortunately as it is and then they just like were trying to reclaim their
(3:22:22) own sexuality by you know why are you guys just trying to
(3:22:27) base all of your arguments on the wildest outliers like what I'm just asking questions
(3:22:34) it's a terrible tactic for making an argument
(3:22:40) you have not made the best arguments tonight
(3:22:46) like what would you guys think of this particular it's a fair hypothetical yeah
(3:22:52) uh so okay so if the girl got raped which is highly unfortunate and tragic
(3:22:58) and then that kicked off her going out and [ __ ] like 300 400 people then yes
(3:23:04) even though it sucks I would be really weary of getting to serious relationship with her unless she has addressed that
(3:23:11) issue which is causing her to go out oh I assume she would tell she would have been talking about so the important
(3:23:17) thing here right blank psychology not the fact of the body right so if you're yes
(3:23:24) if you got raped a thousand times and have a body count of a thousand but it affects your psychology in no way if we
(3:23:30) want to do all the crazy hypotheticals right then it's like okay we're not gonna make presumably a determination on the basis of that what we would say is
(3:23:36) maybe like oh my God how did you get raped a thousand times that's crazy it's like how is this where the [ __ ] are you
(3:23:42) hanging [ __ ] are you okay right but that's the point it's the underlying things not the fact of the body count
(3:23:48) that matters I think we all realize this yeah I I agree well I don't know if Rachel and Andrew would agree but I do
(3:23:54) agree with that but at the end of the day you don't you're making a decision with limited
(3:24:00) information because at the end of the day you don't know how your girlfriend or your future wife truly feels so
(3:24:07) there's certain things that you have to make a decision by there's an exception for every rule are there some girls have a high body count who can make great
(3:24:13) Partners I'm sure there are right but again like you're working on limited information and if your choices Andrew
(3:24:21) wouldn't answer this question so I may maybe maybe you would Alex um what is the high about account
(3:24:28) um to me I would say that a high body count it depends on the age also if we're saying like my age you're the same
(3:24:34) age as I am so yes 30s I would say like when we get past I would say like past
(3:24:40) like 15 20 it gets like up there past like 50 is high and you're aware people
(3:24:46) are in 50 or 15. past 50 is like high past 15 20 is getting up there here
(3:24:52) where people are in back chat no Alex people are in fact there's some other people in the
(3:24:58) um there's actually no one there was somebody who wanted
(3:25:06) I want to like pin Andrew a little bit here yeah all right so um
(3:25:15) uh okay I'll put you I'll put you guys next to each other so you can really pin him there we go great I need to get I
(3:25:22) might need to get boosted my mic's just really quiet no you sound perfect now oh I'll turn you up
(3:25:28) Nina uh Andrew I I know you said uh later on
(3:25:35) the debate that merely what you were doing was displaying the fact that if all things were equal if we had a perfect like ontological clone of a
(3:25:42) woman and everything was the same except one had a low bodycon or it was a virgin and one at a high body count you said
(3:25:47) like that was all that you were saying that most men would pick the low body counter The Virgins correct am I understanding that
(3:25:54) yeah I just say I think on average that's true but you you weren't implying that throughout the entirety of the
(3:26:00) discussion right you're implying more than that throughout the majority of the discussion
(3:26:05) why do you think I was online I think you're losing using a lot of loaded language around topics of sexuality I
(3:26:11) don't care about your opinion tell me what it was well you're the worst person conversations are kind of like
(3:26:16) subjective right so it's about the interpretation of the audience and you're a pretty skilled retortition so I I don't think you are unaware of the
(3:26:23) implications that you were making that everyone don't care about your opinion what's the argument that you have a problem with I'm pointing out the fact
(3:26:30) that at the end you said your conclusion was different than the implication of your argument was throughout the entire so I made you feel bad got it you don't
(3:26:36) actually have an argument do you have an argument or not Nick I don't have an argument I'm criticizing your argument I'm presenting like a counter factual
(3:26:43) okay well give me give me the counter argument then not how you feel I I don't have a counter argument I'm criticizing
(3:26:49) your argument you just don't like criticism Andrew on on the basis that your conclusion was
(3:26:55) not commensurate with what you were saying throughout the debate so that sounds like an argument wait
(3:27:02) that sounds like an argument so you're saying that my conclusion was not consistent with the rest of what I said in the debate can you demonstrate that
(3:27:08) for us real quick I'm trying to demonstrate essentially is is bad faith not an error in there oh it's bad faith
(3:27:14) got it so you can't but you can't tell me how or what I shed which was inconsistent just bad faith Andrew
(3:27:22) I I just I just explained right so it's like the conclusion that you said you were merely making is juxtaposed to the
(3:27:28) implication of the arguments that you had throughout the panel right you mean you mean the implication that you drew
(3:27:33) from it not anything that was actually said higher in the implications the entire audience Drew and that everyone
(3:27:39) would draw from the entire company how do you know that that the entire because because because he intuited it it's his
(3:27:46) feelings literally he's telling me that he felt like I meant to say more than I actually said that's his actual uh
(3:27:51) decorative statement here big brain stuff nickel
(3:28:01) that's yeah so it was a bait and switch right if you want to be technical it's a modern Bailey so you
(3:28:06) think you huh if you know that you're making a modern Bailey yeah it's bad face because you're what was the Martin Bailey okay so during the conversation
(3:28:14) you were saying things about how being infidelis and having lots of body lots
(3:28:20) of bodies is uh makes you a bad partner right no never happened
(3:28:26) okay so let me get this right maybe I understood maybe I misunderstood sorry clearly you didn't say at any point
(3:28:32) throughout the entirety of the conversation that if a woman has a high body count
(3:28:38) she is more likely to or in general or is basically almost always going to be a
(3:28:45) worse partner no everyone on this my arguments
(3:28:51) my argument was that the more dudes the chickens up sleeping with the less
(3:28:58) valuable she usually is generally to dudes how much reduced our ability to pair
(3:29:05) bond is right I didn't bring up hair bonding you brought up the Prairie
(3:29:11) but one of you two did bring it up you were literally pillering Lauren
(3:29:17) about the implications that's true but that doesn't mean I brought it up okay so are you saying that you disagree with
(3:29:22) the Prairieville study and its implications that that you seem to be addressing about it having an impact on
(3:29:27) human uh pair bonding so you don't think that's true no I in fact my argument was is that I
(3:29:33) think that if you look at that Vol study especially when it's talking about the chemical makeup of the voles that you
(3:29:40) could maybe make some application here but that wasn't what our dispute was about yeah so but I'm asking you then so what what do you think about the study
(3:29:46) about the Prairie rolls then you're gonna have to wait till tomorrow when I have a debate on this with Ashley literally Nick did you know that they've
(3:29:52) actually debunked that by actually studying prayer evils I sent that article to Andrew so yeah I know about
(3:29:59) that I don't think he knows how to read so um I I just so okay so you're saying you you refuse to answer the question about
(3:30:06) whether or not you think the Prairieville study well not when I have a debate scheduled with my debate
(3:30:11) opponent tomorrow literally yeah maybe you should go to bed
(3:30:20) what does this have to do with what you claim is the bad faith argumentation due
(3:30:26) to the implication of an argument I never made Nick well so it is literally an argument that you okay and what's the
(3:30:32) argument again that I that you're claiming I made that ran through hoes are worse Partners worst Partners or
(3:30:38) less desired by the opposite sex I would say they are pretty clear that you made both okay well then you just go
(3:30:45) ahead and show me that clip that you won't be able to find because you just lied what I want to ask you right now
(3:30:52) let's just ask him right now whoa may I please Nick I don't think though that
(3:30:57) that would be the definition of bad faith so bet I can give the definition of bad faith please do and then explain how
(3:31:03) what he did was bad faith I'm confused on that one I'm not trying to control I'm dead ass yeah it's so bad faith is
(3:31:09) very explicitly when you're engaging with people in uh discussion or negotiation uh on the basis of deception
(3:31:17) of either them or yourself that's what bad faith is so if you're if for example
(3:31:22) if you could make an argument throughout a debate right that is very big in scope and then at the end of the debate you
(3:31:28) say and so and simply or in in okay simply
(3:31:34) um only this little tiny this tiny little uh this tiny little conclusion right that I'll give a good example what
(3:31:41) I thought was really bad faith was when Nina was talking about her best friends and she said Rachel and Andrew but she
(3:31:47) didn't mention me that was really bad for me
(3:31:55) I'm super sorry but I gotta go thank you so much for having me on everybody catch me on Infowars fourth hour of Alex Jones
(3:32:02) tomorrow oh yeah all right I love you Rachel we love you we love you all right Nick
(3:32:10) do you have any more questions for Andrew um feisty Andrew my brother in Christ I
(3:32:17) have no enemies and I love you and I wish that you would um you would change your ways and stop
(3:32:23) lying to people all the time can you give me the the any lives that
(3:32:29) I've given to people can you go ahead and do that for me now okay um are you just slandering
(3:32:34) live He's just on here to slander so would you actually just are you so are you just mad because
(3:32:41) I think maybe we can maybe we can like it's just bad that not so erudite has
(3:32:46) two conflicting sets of values and she got exposed as having two conflicting sets of values as a Christian you're
(3:32:52) just mad and so you're coming on here to vent that's what I think
(3:33:05) I think the fact Andrew that you won't let
(3:33:13) me speak uporiously uh and drop me is proof that you you've spoken far more in this
(3:33:19) exchange with me than I have Nick so that's because I was asking the question that you keep dodging so then you're
(3:33:26) saying that you interrupt me like you are right now yeah so okay go ahead let me ask the question about deception
(3:33:32) right so would you would you extend the definition of lying to any sort of interaction in which you're being deceptive with people intentionally
(3:33:37) deceptive would that be lying uh no there could be instances there
(3:33:44) could be instances where you could be deceiving intentionally where it would not be alive for instance a magician I
(3:33:49) don't think a magician yeah to me anytime you're interacting with
(3:33:55) someone uh deceptively I call it a lie so I'll change I'll change my friends you're not a liar you're deceptive so
(3:34:00) what I was going to say oh man uh with all the gift I can't remember what I was going to say anymore um
(3:34:06) yeah that you were I remember what your point was that you were saying that I would say that that's mostly true I
(3:34:12) would agree like mostly with that Nick because I was talking with Nick I was talking with Nick but Nick I was just
(3:34:18) literally getting him an olive branch and saying I think that mostly that's probably correct that if you intend to
(3:34:24) deceive it's a lie I could just think of like couple examples where it seems gray cool so we have a basically similar
(3:34:30) definition of lying interception I'll just use deception since it seems less muddy so um
(3:34:35) would you agree uh that it's deceptive when you're arguing with someone uh on
(3:34:41) the basis of I don't know say example uh how to formulate uh logical arguments or
(3:34:47) coherent statements or something like that right how to take inferences and create conclusions out of them and rather than engaging with the inference
(3:34:54) and the conclusions you just say can you explain the three laws of logic
(3:34:59) what if the person what if the person hang on what if the person's previous hang on hang on no you hold on let me
(3:35:05) answer his question let me answer his questions okay fair enough sorry so then so then answer this for me Nick if the
(3:35:11) previous statement which led to that was in an in and of itself bad faith where they say when's the last time you took X
(3:35:17) when's the last time you took X studies right yeah so then hang on so so hang on so
(3:35:26) hang on so then you so then you retort you're saying that uh that I'm in the wrong for explaining that that's not
(3:35:32) actually how logic works it's not based on Geometry I never said logic was based on Geometry but geometry the class has
(3:35:39) an entire section which is about logic based proposition so if you did poorly in your geometry class it's probably
(3:35:45) because you struggle with logic structures
(3:35:53) is probably because you struggle with logic con but really quick Nick I'm just I am curious though because you were you
(3:35:59) were explaining like would you say this is bad faith would you say this is deceitful or line which seemed to all be
(3:36:05) tied into that right but I and I'm just I'm sorry but I'm just an arguer I love
(3:36:10) to play Devil's Advocate but did you not come on a panel for the specific reason to try to like kind of paint Andrew into
(3:36:17) a corner and and kind of attack him maybe through some deceptive measure like
(3:36:23) because my opinion like I thought you were coming on the panel like engage in the whole conversation maybe bring
(3:36:28) something more to things but like it seems like you had an agenda from the moment you got here and you were being very deceptive and Coy about the way you
(3:36:35) went about it until Andrew kind of forced you to admit the real reason why you're here so by your own definition of
(3:36:40) bad faith I felt like you were kind of being bad faith and it was just confusing me I I again uh being bad your
(3:36:48) definition I don't really understand it I'm sorry yeah it's actually a really important thing to look up on like
(3:36:53) Wikipedia to understand exactly what bad faith means so um me coming in Wikipedia the [ __ ] out
(3:36:59) of it I'm not sorry I'm not trying to condescend you I was just saying it's like really it was a little bit thank you for acknowledging that it's fine go
(3:37:06) ahead I'm sorry that you felt it was condescending um so you admitted
(3:37:14) come on though you know what you're doing with your language there that's fair run
(3:37:20) um okay so anyway what I was saying is so it wouldn't be bad faith because there was no deception what I did is I came onto the panel and when I wanted to
(3:37:27) pin Andrew on things I said hey would it be okay for me to pin Andrew on some things right so it's like if I came in
(3:37:32) and I was just like hey guys I'm just here to be like buddy buddy Kumbaya man I just I'm just like what I thought you said would it be okay if I asked them
(3:37:41) no I specifically said can I pin him on something and then Alex moved me up and be like here in this way you can pin him
(3:37:46) more directly so yeah I said specifically opinion about some things after you had asked no I meant when you first came on though and you're like hey
(3:37:52) guys can I ask some questions and then you were kind of being Coy and you remember like in the beginning and you
(3:37:57) were asking questions and Andrew was finally like what what are you getting at like get to the point obviously you
(3:38:02) have an agenda in my opinion coming into a situation having an agenda or a
(3:38:07) preconceived you know and you know what an agenda an agenda is right like yeah
(3:38:14) um having an agenda and not getting straight to the point when you come into a situation that could all also be seen
(3:38:20) as maybe a little bad faith so I I don't think it's susceptive to come in and say that I want to pin
(3:38:27) Andrew on some stuff and then to say that I think your argument is bad faith I don't I don't know that's that's what that's not what I thought was deceptive
(3:38:34) or bad faith about your behavior yeah but can you imagine all of us you you
(3:38:39) were on this soapbox yeah that's more than me that's more
(3:38:45) than me so yeah Alex Alex I'm having fun sorry that's okay that's cool um I got
(3:38:51) trt and deca so you know kind of on the field I'm you sorry guys I'm on
(3:38:57) yeah um again sorry that you felt that I came off condescending you wasn't my
(3:39:02) intention I apologize um holy [ __ ] where were we Andrew you've been Transformer than Angela to be fair
(3:39:09) Nick you're the only reason why I know what condescending means and that's the truth you went on a whole ass rant about
(3:39:15) it and I learned the difference between like being mean and being condescending which is how I knew you were
(3:39:21) condescending just now to give you some credit do you have any more questions for
(3:39:28) Andrew before we move on to the next thing uh I think it's just gonna evolve as you come forward anyway
(3:39:35) um I I want to talk to Ben Thorpe Alex oh my god do you think you can bench
(3:39:41) press Andrew Nick you want it you want me to set up a debate he's been begging me for the last like weeks
(3:39:48) do you think you could bench press Andrew this is a very serious ly
(3:39:54) if you're if you're willing to do it I'm downstairs bench press Andrew
(3:40:01) uh Andrew's probably over like 2 30. Andrew weird okay don't make it weird
(3:40:08) I'm just curious I don't think I could I don't think I could bench press Andrew Nina wants to see some sweat I wait I
(3:40:14) weigh 185 pounds yo Nick give them over from Kyla and uh
(3:40:22) text me and we'll set it up okay cool let's [ __ ] go I'll just try to put it in super fast Andrew I think that when
(3:40:29) you engage in a conversation acting as though you have grand implications to your argument saying things such as okay
(3:40:34) uh women who are ran through have uh an inability to pair bond referencing the study about Prairie bowls
(3:40:42) about these things multiple times before this isn't the only time hey Michael Jackson you want to shut the
(3:40:48) [ __ ] up unless you change your mind about that we are listening to Nick cook Nick start over for just a second ago I
(3:40:55) want to hear this sorry photography I want to ask a question Nick is talking you can go save my panel
(3:41:02) bro bro I'd be underscored um okay yeah so even further to the bad faith is the fact that right now you're pretending as
(3:41:08) though these are not your beliefs you're entertaining that these are not your beliefs when they actually are I know that they are because I've heard you
(3:41:13) talk about them multiple times on multiple panels in many situations you say so on the basis of empirical uh uh
(3:41:19) validation through studies like the prayer Evol study and you talk about it from a uh
(3:41:25) uh sins versus virtues perspective from a Christian uh directionality you do think it is the
(3:41:32) case that having a high body count makes you a worse partner makes you this that and the other thing I don't know why you're pretending like you don't believe
(3:41:37) that now everyone knows that you do believe that and so pretending that that's not what you believe in that it wasn't what you were arguing throughout
(3:41:44) the entirety of the panel and then saying I'm merely saying that typically speaking the majority of men all other
(3:41:51) things removed would prefer a woman who is a virgin over a woman with a hundred bodies I'm saying that is deceptive
(3:41:58) you're engaging in bad faith that is not correct and I think you should stop wait can we put hands up would you rather
(3:42:03) have your dick sucked by somebody I know I'm like just trying to be somebody who has never such a dick versus the person
(3:42:10) I mean it doesn't have to be a woman man doesn't matter would you want somebody to suck your dick that has no experience
(3:42:23) yeah so raise your hand then I'll take a woman with experience Andrew
(3:42:29) wants bad [ __ ] I guess
(3:42:35) I want to ask you the question bro final note this idea that women men hate hoes is [ __ ] [ __ ] bro half the rap
(3:42:41) song yeah it's [ __ ] [ __ ] we [ __ ] love [ __ ] bro that's just facts Angela don't you okay good morning
(3:42:48) tomorrow my love I have like the perfect song for me huh yeah Angela don't you
(3:42:54) have an early morning tomorrow I can't always have early morning but I'm not a [ __ ] and I'll just sit this through even though I stopped with this whole
(3:43:00) thing and couldn't contribute to [ __ ] so yeah I love you I'm sorry
(3:43:07) all right let's let Michael J ask his question and then go ahead I have a
(3:43:12) question for Michael J though where did he get that super sexy picture of Destiny for his Avatar well you know
(3:43:19) when you say the night at my house after we you know that's that's right I'm just kidding amazing
(3:43:24) it's kind of funny the story I have about Destiny is um when I first got my puppies
(3:43:30) um he was he went to my friend's house I don't know if you know who Trump is and
(3:43:35) um when I first got my dog she was there just gonna um
(3:43:43) yeah so I just want to ask Nick a question about uh you know you sort of uh I watch an erudite stream like in not
(3:43:50) so like you guys are Christians right yeah I'm just like so shocked like yeah so you guys are like in favor of like uh
(3:43:58) like Prime security like you know women who is you guys who are you referring to uh Nick and uh I don't think they're in
(3:44:04) favor well you guys are like open to these things like you guys would be okay with like you know homosexuals
(3:44:12) let's say like women you know like doing only fans and stuff like you'll be okay you guys would be okay with those things
(3:44:17) right right Nick I I think basically like our society is fine with it so I'm not gonna say
(3:44:24) anything about it basically like you're like actual religion you know like you as a Christian like would you be okay as
(3:44:29) a Christian do you think you know as a Christian as a practicing question would that be like an acceptable or would that like not make you a bad question at all
(3:44:36) so here's where it gets complicated um me and erudite are not Orthodox Christian Eastern Orthodox Christians or
(3:44:42) like Catholics right who have like a bra a super easy list of Dogma um uh we are like non-denominational uh
(3:44:51) Protestant Christians and so we think that like figuring out what is right and what is wrong is really important to do
(3:44:57) within a cultural context of your Society your civilization your time your period time of time and stuff like that
(3:45:02) really I thought you guys said you weren't solo scriptures well I don't know what we're not so scripture I don't
(3:45:07) know well if you're not solo scriptura then how do you know what is your interpretation correct who's who who do you appeal to
(3:45:15) for you Andrew what does that mean it means it means by Bible the God the
(3:45:20) Father the Son and the Holy Spirit yeah I don't appeal to any of them that's all the scriptura that is solo scriptura so
(3:45:25) you think that the holy spirit is giving you the correct interpretation of the Bible right wait no no hold on this is a
(3:45:30) misinterpretation of any of the five Solas which I I don't I don't hear to any of the five solos um so where do you draw The Authority
(3:45:37) for the Bible yeah so I already I already told you through my own Revelation uh and uh with God basically
(3:45:44) and Andy is the holy spirit involved in that yeah okay so then that's one of the five Solas so it'd be faith alone that'd
(3:45:51) be Sola feed a and solo scriptura both of those would be involved in that right no that that would be if I only regarded
(3:45:57) those right so if I thought that so for example with solo scriptura I'm sorry I don't want to derail the panel into
(3:46:02) theology but if I was Sola scriptura I would say there is no other book there is no other text it is not okay for me
(3:46:09) to accept any other what other text and book do you use then what do you mean for your Christianity
(3:46:16) The Book of Enoch for example and lots of teachings you use the Book of Enoch how do you know it's Canon can we now
(3:46:22) get into a religious today this is like Ultra boring well it's not it's not actually Ultra boring right because the
(3:46:28) thing is is that the question which was asked to Nick is you know have these values that you have you said that you
(3:46:35) don't believe in any of the five Solas so where would you be drawing your church Authority I'm just curious what Authority are you appealing to if it's
(3:46:42) not through the Solas I already I already said Revelation I already explained divine revelation but that's going to be ratified by the Solas what
(3:46:48) else could you use what else could you use Nick well no no I do not want to get into a religious debate I mean honestly
(3:46:55) I just want an answer to that question I answered his what else could you use besides the Solas what else could you
(3:47:00) use that's that question yeah I already said my relationship with God like Faith
(3:47:07) you know magical that would be through faith alone that
(3:47:13) was okay all five all five of them were contandons no more religious [ __ ] it's foreign
(3:47:31) remember that [ __ ] [ __ ] I'll I'll make an exception for that Looney Tunes at all uh
(3:47:38) okay well just like those things alone but yeah to Michael to finish your your question right so I I was saying that
(3:47:45) [ __ ] hey you asked me if it's fine if we think like homosexuality I'll rephrase I'll rephrase the question just be clear
(3:47:50) all right keep going no just like simple enough like by any
(3:47:56) Christian standard like do you not consider yourself to be like a bad Christian that's kind of what I asked by any Christian standard like I think
(3:48:03) that's like I think like all men fall short of the glory of God and so I'm not perfect and I'm just trying to figure
(3:48:08) things out as I go basically so you are admitting that you're like a flawed like you are deliberately practicing
(3:48:13) Christianity in a flawed manner no no so that would be like admitting to be like
(3:48:18) a gnostic or something like that what I'm saying is that
(3:48:43) do you want okay uh Michael J do you want to ask anyone about anything aside
(3:48:49) from religion uh yeah I wanted to ask Lauren like a
(3:48:54) simple I mean you're like a uh conservative right Laura like you you know how to get
(3:48:59) a law degree too right that's like yeah okay all right um
(3:49:05) so like what part of like conservatism like do you side with like what you're like you say you voted for Trump or something or like what how are you a
(3:49:11) conservative basically like how do you differentiate yourself in like a a liberal let's say
(3:49:17) in many in many aspects let's say like a destiny person let's say like think of
(3:49:22) Destiny for instance like how are you different any different than this yeah do you even know who that is Destiny
(3:49:28) yes it rings a bell but he seems right he's pretty irrelevant so I'll just move
(3:49:34) on the gym straight to politics this is very spicy um I I like for one I think that the way
(3:49:41) that we handled covid that's what got me into politics in the first place I'm very Pro for like I'm very
(3:49:47) pro-constitution uh I felt like the government was throttling our first amendment rights by involving themselves
(3:49:54) with uh social media I don't think that we should ability to uh talk and uh to have the
(3:50:04) Public Square are you an anti-vaxxer with Destiny's in favor I did not get the covet box I did not think the co-fit
(3:50:11) Box oh so you're [ __ ] okay oh you didn't get back tonight what I didn't get the only thing you've said so far
(3:50:17) not getting a vaccine makes you [ __ ] yeah there was not enough and also the J and J one was recalled so
(3:50:25) if that tells you anything like everybody who got that yeah do you do did you actually follow what happened with that I did yeah it was but and then
(3:50:33) then you would know that it was recalled as in like that's generally how it works
(3:50:41) yeah for a certain amount of time and then
(3:50:47) they realize that there's no actual like risk that or they have like curtailed the risk that um was the issue so they
(3:50:55) they just this is like the most normal I can't even tell you how boring this
(3:51:00) makes me want to take a nap how boring this problem but this kind of this kind of outside of like the frame by the way by the way guys guys if we're gonna get
(3:51:07) into the jabby stabbies I actually got a book okay now wait out of respect for
(3:51:12) Andrew let's not get into that uh yeah it won't get your guys's Channel band
(3:51:18) but it'll get my channel banned I actually have a few questions for you
(3:51:24) uh do you mind if ask you a few questions Andrew uh yeah I don't mind but I do want to
(3:51:30) wrap this up because we've been open for like four hours we're gonna wrap up
(3:51:36) uh well that's not gonna work if I have questions before you I'm sorry could I allow uh
(3:51:42) Lauren to like finish answering my question if that's okay okay that's fine yeah okay so I just like ask you to name like how he did from Destiny when you so
(3:51:49) far you name one thing like the vaccine I don't believe in global warming I said that multiple times like yeah
(3:51:55) um because people always try to [ __ ]
(3:52:01) bomb the stream near the end of it so we have to delete it I'm sorry well I though that cause
(3:52:08) are you a vampire yeah hey sorry about that I was I wasn't talking to you guys interested myself on that side
(3:52:15) I think there's a lot of evidence to show that you're a vampire because the only time I see it
(3:52:21) wait stop let's let Lauren answer the question I want to ask her I want to build a wall why don't we have a strong
(3:52:31) gave Morgan she's Beaver coded I don't think that we should be as giving all of
(3:52:37) this money to Ukraine especially because I think that a lot of it is being uh
(3:52:43) given to corrupt hands that are not even using it for the purposes of Defending Ukraine as we've seen what do you think
(3:52:49) is military weapons have already been sold to the Russian army to hurt Ukraine even
(3:52:55) though it was meant to defend Ukraine um I don't I as for our the handling
(3:53:01) like as in between choosing between Joe Biden and then Trump I don't like the way that Joe Biden pulled out of
(3:53:07) Afghanistan I don't like the way the current Democratic that was Trump's plan no it wasn't no it was not yes it was
(3:53:14) Trump's plan was yes it was Afghanistan I I got I just gotta I gotta split so I
(3:53:21) just wanted to say goodbye all right Andrew
(3:53:27) I love her all right let's get our politics have respect for Andrew and his stream I just I want to ask him uh well
(3:53:36) but politics is not involved in the initial topic was to be anyway because this is going to go for another five hours to begin to like [ __ ]
(3:53:42) Afghanistan uh okay so I have a few questions I wrote down for you well you're just trying to leave can we just
(3:53:47) say bye to him no well like I just want to ask him like I've literally waited for four hours to ask these questions
(3:53:55) you can't leave no choice all right so first I want to clarify your position on divorce uh do you think the government
(3:54:01) should be involved in the forcing who can you try to leave [Music]
(3:54:07) Nina let me ask him he's a he's an adult he can leave if he wants to he said he's
(3:54:13) down to answer a few questions I won't keep him for more than five minutes so anyway so do you think the government should be involved in enforcing to get
(3:54:19) divorced or is that purely something that should be done by the church do I think that the government should be
(3:54:25) involved in forcing people to get a divorce is that your question who can get a divorce or do you think that's
(3:54:30) something that should be relegated purely to the church yeah I think for secularists if they were going to do some kind of secular marriage I think
(3:54:36) that they would probably have to have the state involved for an enforcement arm for whatever whatever that means to
(3:54:41) them so then my follow-up question why is it that the government should be involved
(3:54:47) in enforcing divorce but not enforcing alimony I didn't say that they should I said
(3:54:52) there's isolated cases I think where even the church would probably demand alimony but I think you said that generally
(3:54:58) alimony should not be something that the government should pursue except for small exceptions
(3:55:05) yeah well I mean I don't like the idea of alimony to begin with but I do think that their arcs have going to be
(3:55:10) exceptions to that rule um it just depends it's situationally based so I think that there could be
(3:55:16) times where alimony is appropriate depending on the welfare of the child at least if you're talking about the
(3:55:22) state in state enforcement well when it comes to the welfare of the child it's generally child support right there
(3:55:28) that's what we'll kick in we're talking about alimony we're talking about for the wife who didn't work or it could go
(3:55:34) the other way which it rarely does so I guess like I don't know like I feel like either the government should
(3:55:41) play a role in both so so I so I don't I don't I don't separate these two things if you're going to have a secularist
(3:55:48) state right where there's there's no religion involved however you want to format secular marriage I don't really
(3:55:55) care it's not important to me because I don't believe that it's real marriage I don't think that you have a real
(3:56:01) marriage so I don't really care how you structure it right I I think that marriage is sacramental I think that
(3:56:07) it's an actual Sacrament so from my purview if you're talking about the church and church enforcement I think
(3:56:13) that the church may have some isolated examples I don't know what they would be off the top of my head where maybe they
(3:56:19) would allow there to be alimony and I'm sure that secularists would have some standard for that for whatever framework
(3:56:25) they had for divorce as well or marriage it doesn't sound I'm sorry I was very confused I'm it
(3:56:33) doesn't sound like you want just the church to be doing the enforcing because the church doesn't have much power when
(3:56:40) it comes to like forcing people to stay together and whatnot aside from like social pressure
(3:56:46) no they do they have the power of excommunication and that's why Catholics often don't Grant divorces and why other
(3:56:52) churches don't Grant divorce even Protestants will exert Authority in this right Calvinists do it all the time and
(3:56:58) say that you need to stay together inside of your marriage and begin to work things out they do they can't exert quite a bit of influence they really can
(3:57:04) I'll just grant you all that but then you still want the government uh the state to be involved in enforcing who
(3:57:11) can get divorced it's not that I wanted or don't I don't care if it's from a secular perspective I don't care I don't
(3:57:18) consider that to be marriage so I I want the the state to recognize
(3:57:24) religious marriage and allow the religious marriage to be have the enforcement done through the church
(3:57:30) absent the state I think that that it's possible to do now to a small degree
(3:57:35) Mormons do it to a small degree due to some of the laws that they have in some of their regions but it's very very tiny
(3:57:41) amount of people who are allowed to do this engage in this well when you said you don't like no fault divorce that's a
(3:57:47) state thing that's not a church thing you know no fault divorce is also
(3:57:52) National right so so are you saying that for religious people you don't think they're
(3:57:58) stupid National divorce policy by the way wait so are you are you saying that for
(3:58:03) um for religious people the state should not be involved at all in divorce and
(3:58:08) marriage yeah I think that if you're a person who is devoted to your religion and you're
(3:58:14) getting uh married under your religious prescription that I don't I don't see a reason why the state needs to be involved in that yeah honestly what
(3:58:21) everything Andrew's saying here makes perfect sense from like a religious perspective like most religious people would just say marriage is a religious
(3:58:27) Sacrament first and foremost and the formal legal contract doesn't really matter and like he said like in
(3:58:32) Catholicism they don't even recognize divorce there's only annulment
(3:58:44) for like three hours [ __ ] five questions and then you can
(3:58:49) go back Alex is going down down and down a hole alone well I'm not even trying to
(3:58:55) like gorilla am I just kind of want to figure it out um okay so uh before I was really
(3:59:03) interrupted by someone I'm sorry I'm sorry I accept your apology um
(3:59:08) so then for a what would be the litmus test for like where do you draw the line
(3:59:14) if someone's religious enough is it just purely based on what they claim like hey I'm a religious person uh or is there
(3:59:21) some kind of a litmus test like they have to go to church once a week they have to like how do you determine if someone's religious enough to have a
(3:59:28) religious wedding instead of a state wedding the same way that you would determine that they can have a marriage now right so the thing is is uh if
(3:59:36) you're opting in for a church marriage you're going to be married by officiates of the church they're going to know if you're a member of the church in good
(3:59:41) standing man so any anyone who wants to do can do no it's not anybody who wants to do it becoming so this is a purely
(3:59:49) Protestant perspective it's very easy for people to just make the claim that they're Protestants that's fine okay anybody can do that but in order to be
(3:59:56) like a member of the Catholic church or the Orthodox Church a process that takes many years they
(4:00:03) um will have to baptize you themselves so if you're what's that I I just let him then get
(4:00:09) confirmed like yeah it takes it takes many years it's not it's I mean it's not something that you just go oh I am
(4:00:15) that's not how that works so you have to be inducted into the church so there's quite the pro there's there's quite the
(4:00:21) process for it well no you can't just say I want to go have a religious marriage it's not that's not how that
(4:00:27) would work well if you're saying that for religious people the government should stay out of marriage and should
(4:00:32) be enforced to the church I agree with you I don't think we have any disagreements so then the follow-up
(4:00:37) question is what about for secular people should they just not get married at all or should that be should that
(4:00:45) involve the state or how I understand um from a secular perspective why
(4:00:50) secularists would want to have uh maybe some form of protection for marriage and this and that but it seems like it's a
(4:00:56) really bad deal for men who are secularists I'm not exactly sure why it
(4:01:01) is that they would want at this point uh to get married and have state enforcement I really I can't even under
(4:01:07) understand what the point of it is I I really don't even understand what the point of it is there's no actual
(4:01:13) grounding or Divine command saying You must so why the hell do you do it I don't I don't even get it yeah I think I
(4:01:20) agree with with what you're saying I okay your position is different than what I thought it was going to be but
(4:01:26) you're basically saying you don't actually want the state to be involved you want the church to be involved for
(4:01:31) religious people yeah I do well I just don't I really don't understand and I never have understood
(4:01:37) why do non-religious people want to get married in the first place I don't actually get it you're asking the wrong
(4:01:43) guy I have no reason why what is so hard to believe that people want to get married
(4:01:49) if they're not religious because you can do all of the same we could the state could have the the same exact
(4:01:55) enforcement mechanisms that you would want everything across the board without ever calling it marriage my family is
(4:02:02) um I'm personally non-religious but my boyfriend or fiance is um religious so
(4:02:09) he wants to do a religious kind of ceremony so do you think I should be denied that
(4:02:14) I think that the church would deny you that yeah they would not do that you're just lying but like why why do you think she's
(4:02:21) lying I think that they they very well may deny you a marriage if your husband was a member of the church and you were
(4:02:27) not they very well could deny you that yeah he does have a point there Nina I don't know what else to tell you it also
(4:02:34) depends on what religion religion psychotic there's no point there
(4:02:41) no questions look there there are some exceptions like for instance there's a there's a problem going on inside of
(4:02:46) Orthodox and Catholicism I mean I'm more Godly than you are let's be real hair where sometimes you have like an
(4:02:52) orthodox who will marry a Catholic woman and that can be very challenging inside of those relationships and it takes a
(4:02:57) lot of I mean it's hard and so there has to be a submission aspect and the church basically has to ratify it and say that
(4:03:03) it's okay to do you have spiritual fathers inside of these churches this is not I don't you guys only think of this
(4:03:10) through Protestant prism you go into the church and then you leave Andrew do you go to
(4:03:15) search every Sunday two Sundays a month so not every Sunday no two Sundays a
(4:03:22) month my church is really far away so I made the commitment I mean but yeah it seems like you're
(4:03:28) really never it's not an argument it's not a weak argument in the middle of a Michigan winter to try to drag my entire
(4:03:34) family two hours to the closest Orthodox Church I'm sorry it's not a weak argument I mean
(4:03:42) no true no offense but I meant it was a weak argument of Nina's oh sorry but
(4:03:49) it's kind of weak that you didn't want to move to near an orthodox if Orthodox prices
(4:03:59) and the spiritual fathers of the church who say that hey this is okay to do
(4:04:04) within the framework and purview of your situation our church members in that community
(4:04:12) Church in the
(4:04:52) we kind of agree on the uh marriage thing so I'm gonna move on to the next thing I want to kind of explore where
(4:04:57) you stand emotional abuse so I'm gonna ask you a few questions if your wife for example doesn't [ __ ] you for three years
(4:05:02) would you diverse her divorce her yeah well what are the
(4:05:08) circumstances behind it like let's just say she chooses not to there's no good reasons
(4:05:13) like not having it anymore so if Rachel were to abandon her faith and we were to
(4:05:19) have tons and tons of interaction with spiritual fathers of our church and under absolutely no circumstances was
(4:05:25) she willing to perform what is part of her duties as a wife then they may Grant a divorce yeah wow you make that sound
(4:05:33) so sexy so your reasons well our religion's not about being sexy
(4:05:39) for you Lauren really okay so I have another question what if she insults you every day for three years again then we
(4:05:47) would see counseling and through especially through the church and we would try to work those problems out marriage is hard
(4:05:53) marriage is difficult it's not easy and the thing is is maybe there have been years where she's insulted me every day
(4:05:59) for all you know the thing is it doesn't matter because sometimes in marriage you have rough years not just rough months
(4:06:05) rough days rough years and people grow together through challenge just like with friendships friendships are a
(4:06:11) series of Trials before you can call someone a friend otherwise they're not really your friend if you haven't gone through anything with somebody you can
(4:06:17) call them a friend you're a [ __ ] idiot because they're not your friend so basically you're saying is that you
(4:06:24) would see counseling first and then if it ultimately didn't work out then you would call it quits right is that
(4:06:30) correct I couldn't I listen you're misinterpreting this again I don't get to call it quits that would be within
(4:06:36) the purview again of the church I can't just be like I'm done the church would take a look at the entirety of the
(4:06:42) situation before they'd make a determination like that and more than likely they would put down like different behavioral programs and things
(4:06:49) like that to do everything they possibly could to salvage the marriage like most churches would
(4:06:54) okay I mean I don't even necessarily disagree with that that much uh another the last thing I wanted to ask you is um
(4:07:01) you were talking about earlier how there's like it's kind of hard to draw the line for emotional abuse right it's
(4:07:07) like where do you draw the line yeah I feel like the same thing can somewhat applaud to physical abuse like what if
(4:07:13) you mildly push your life away when she gets in your face would that be considered physical abuse right yeah so
(4:07:19) you can you can extend this too and be like what about like smacking around the rear end when she's not expecting it and
(4:07:25) it surprises her so she lets out a scream right it's like listen I think that when you're talking about physical
(4:07:31) abuse we can draw far less of an arbitrary line than we can when it comes to emotional abuse I think it's far
(4:07:37) easier to make the determination on what's being physically abusive and what isn't being physically abusive and I
(4:07:44) think that there when you're talking about consent it's the easiest possible thing to identify like hey I don't like
(4:07:49) being slapped and you slap her I think I think you can identify those situations far easier when I say that there is
(4:07:56) um like that it's even arbitrary there's no system no there's a system for identifying these things for sure what I
(4:08:03) say that finding the line can sometimes be difficult sure but I think it's far more obvious okay I mean that's fair I
(4:08:09) actually agree with pretty much everything you've said so we don't even have much disagreement oddly enough uh
(4:08:15) okay I'll kick it off to anyone who wants to I guess say something all right guys well have a great night I'm gonna
(4:08:21) get out of here take care of yourself Ginger fantastic seeing you as always as my other best friend we'll see Nina at

(4:10:59) let's just let her cook are you really
(4:11:05) is that people are getting censored for persecuting one religious group and not
(4:11:11) persecuting other religious groups and I do think there is a harsher uh it is you
(4:11:16) get harsher consequences for being anti-semitic than you do for being racist against anything
(4:11:30) thank you so much for having me Alex um always good to see all of y'all um
(4:11:36) [Laughter] Nina do you want to do a quick hide before oh sure I don't understand why

(4:11:48) Chris has to get religion is like anti-Semitism that was about to say you you used a lot of different types of
(4:11:53) bigotry in your well I'm gonna go I don't know um
