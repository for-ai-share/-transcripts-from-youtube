(0:00) let not we we funded all of these groups the CIA right now has boots on the ground in this nation answer but be con
(0:08) he well actually thank you so much for telling me how to speak I I thought you just said they had immunity like you
(0:14) can't have both ways here Jesus do you not understand what I'm getting here specifically I don't understand why
(0:20) these people need to have a pardon it's not your turn it's not your turn Li calm down Li very
(0:26) stop let me get it out yourself talk go ahead anyway I'm trying to trying to
(0:31) you're still talking welcome back to Rattlesnake TV guys in this video we are going to be reviewing Andrew Wilson's
(0:37) debut on Pi Morgan now there's a lot going on in the world at the moment but everybody seems to be a bit quiet on the
(0:42) debate front but not the Wilson they are not taking one step back but that's just the way that it goes around this time of
(0:48) year anyway it was a fine debut and I am convinced that Pi Morgan will be having Andrew on as a regular which will be
(0:55) great for us at the channel and great for you guys out there because I'm sure that we all share the same same Joy at
(1:00) the prospect of Andrew just going on and regularly destroying these mainstream liberals so let's get into the first bit
(1:06) where they briefly discussed the Middle East and the fall of the Assad government in Syria Andrew Wilson I mean
(1:12) it's very complicated do you have confidence that the uh overthrowing of
(1:17) alas actually improve the lives uh of syrians and will it improve Security in
(1:24) the region no of course not uh Trump's made it very clear that he will be working
(1:31) hand inand with Israel on whatever interest Israel has they see this as a weakening of Iran who is a staunch Ally
(1:39) or was a staunch Ally of the uh Assad regime so at this point um you know we
(1:47) have Al-Qaeda coming in you made the Point Pierce uh well wait a second isn't it ridiculous that we're backing up
(1:53) Al-Qaeda I mean Al-Qaeda was essentially formed by rcia so it doesn't really
(1:58) shock me that we're backing them up or that Biden is backing them up um so yeah
(2:03) it is a mess it's extremely complicated there's a multitude of factions this is a 50-year ongoing process in the region
(2:11) uh no it's not going to help security for anybody we should really stop sticking our nose in places which are
(2:17) not our business but unfortunately um we are stuck in this uh at this point we have the one Ally in
(2:24) the area Israel it's one of our staunchest allies and really don't have much choice at this point but to play uh
(2:31) geopolitics with them we're too too far in bed if you go back 10 years ago they might have been a lot more controversial
(2:37) this seems to me now to be the growing sentiment amongst I would say the majority of
(2:44) Americans well that's because the Millennials and um you know uh the next
(2:51) the following Generations have been living their whole lives under uh Perpetual Warfare so uh you know since
(2:57) since 9/11 most of my adult life I have spent with the United States In Perpetual wars in the Middle East that
(3:04) nobody understands they don't really know why we're there soldiers who come back can't really illuminate it any
(3:10) better for you uh people in command can't really illuminate it any better for you and the American people are sick
(3:16) of it uh Trump the great populist that he is recognizes this and he tapped into
(3:22) that as part of his reelection and his initial election and I think it's a it's
(3:27) a really good idea for us to draw back from the Middle Eastern Affairs as much as possible it's not good for the
(3:34) Christian population of the United States uh we have compatibility issues with both Muslim uh ethics and with
(3:41) Jewish ethics so ultimately for us we need to focus on our domestic policies
(3:47) and that's what we put Trump in there to do not to get us involved in foreign affairs yeah M rinsky it's a massive
(3:54) departure from where America has been for the last 60 70 years and really since the end of World War II to take
(4:01) such a an isolationist view but I like I say I do think it's where the majority
(4:06) of Americans sit now quick Interruption guys if you like watching these Libs get absolutely pwned then what you need to
(4:13) do is smash that like button because quite frankly we've got so much more from where that came from and if you'd
(4:18) like to subscribe to the channel if you're getting value you can do that too let's get back to it well it depends on where it ends
(4:25) right the PX Americana has served the world pretty well as you point went out since the since 1945 and the reality is
(4:33) as I said earlier we are the indispensable nation and sometimes uh we don't invite these crises but these
(4:39) crises come to our Shores anyway uh and so I think we need to be very realistic
(4:45) about the fact that the world is very unsettled we've got things going on uh in the Straits of Taiwan right now we've
(4:51) got things going on in Europe right now with respect to Russia and Ukraine we have a huge Refugee crisis as you
(4:56) pointed out from Syria and other places in the lant that are coming to Europe to our European allies including the fact
(5:03) that Donald Trump may or may not want to keep NATO as the force that it's been uh
(5:08) low all these many decades and so look I I I tend to agree that we don't need to get involved in another Middle Eastern
(5:14) fight and we certainly don't need boots on the ground uh in the Middle East but I also want people to be realistic and
(5:20) and understand that we cannot build a moat politically or militarily around
(5:25) the United States and not expect anybody to have what goes on abroad start to
(5:30) affect us because I'm old enough to remember 911 of course it did come to our Shores that day and of course we did
(5:36) have to go to Afghanistan as a result of that we stayed way too long we didn't accomplish the mission we didn't accomplish anything we set out to do I
(5:43) completely get the frustration I was anti-ck war from the very beginning a lot of my friends on the Republican side
(5:50) as I recall for my days at Fox News were the biggest sheer leaders for this Invasion possible now of course
(5:56) everybody's kind of changed their mind but I do want to be realistic as I keep saying that we don't know what's going
(6:03) to happen especially in a place like Syria which was so reminiscent to me of the Iran Iraq war in the 1980s where you
(6:09) didn't really know which side was worse he didn't know who to root more for you kind of had to root against both of them
(6:15) and this is kind of similar to that right we've got a butcher in Bashar al-assad nobody's shedding a tear for
(6:21) him being gone and then we've got this question mark about whether this leopard as you point out has changed his stripes
(6:26) whether he's still allied with al-Qaeda in some capacity and whether they're going to try to build a pluralistic
(6:32) society in Syria protect their minorities protect the alawites protect of which Bashar alassad is won protect
(6:40) uh the Christian Community and see what really happens uh between the sh Sunni and the Shia sect there which also uh
(6:48) obviously plays out but this is not a bad day for the United States because it weakened Iran tremendously it weakened
(6:56) Putin tremendously and it helped the Israel IES get control of their northern border to some extent by by preventing
(7:03) Iran from using Syria as a conduit into Lebanon to help hisbah so I'm not shedding a tear for what happened to
(7:09) Bashar Al Assad this weekend this is this is silly though this totally silly we
(7:15) hang I'll come to you Vinnie let Andrew respond first we can build a moat around the United States absolutely and we
(7:22) should be building a moat around the United States the truth is when you say well um you know that won't won't
(7:28) prevent attacks on the United States like what happened in 9911 no that happened because we didn't build a mode
(7:33) around the United States because we were busy doing nation building all over the world especially during the Cold War we
(7:39) helped fund most of these groups one of which is about to take over which includes Al-Qaeda which were CIA assets
(7:46) it's ridiculous for you to say oh no we can't the let's not let's not say we we
(7:52) fed all of these groups the CIA right now has boots on the ground in this nation and for you and here's the thing
(7:59) we can pretend that they're not there we can pretend that we don't have the CIA all over uh the Middle East we do I
(8:05) guarantee you they're involved in this conflict right this second and that'll probably come out in future documents 10
(8:10) years down 10 years down the road the truth is is that no prot it is our foreign
(8:16) interventionism which causes most of the blowback which then we get attacked for it's mostly us doing foreign
(8:22) intervention regime change things like this so if you guys haven't been following this too closely I think it's actually very difficult to convey just
(8:31) how significant these developments are in terms of the Assad government falling in Syria it has a dramatic effect on
(8:37) global politics really big effect on the war in Ukraine and also the war in Gaza
(8:43) because Israel and Russia both have vested interests in Syria and so this
(8:48) toppling is really good for Israel really bad for Russia and the reason why this has been allowed to occur is
(8:54) because Russia and Iran who are the biggest backers and supporters of Syria are both distracted with other conflicts
(9:01) at the moment so they were unable to assist the Assad government as they previously were doing anyways they're talking here about Al-Qaeda and about
(9:08) mujahadin and the CIA involvement and she's saying that the CIA did not fund Al-Qaeda and Andrew says that the CIA
(9:15) will be involved in this which they obviously will be and she says good as they should be so a little bit hard to ascertain the
(9:22) logic there but in terms of the CIA funding these organizations let's have a listen to Hillary Clinton of all people
(9:28) telling us exactly what they did to be to be fair we had helped to create the problem we're now fighting how because
(9:36) when the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan we had this brilliant idea that we were going to come to Pakistan
(9:41) and create a force of mujahadin equipped them with stinger missiles and everything else to go after the Soviets
(9:48) inside Afghanistan and we were successful the Soviets left Afghanistan and then we said great goodbye leaving
(9:56) these trained people who were fanatical in Afghanistan and Pakistan leaving them
(10:04) well-armed creating a mess frankly that uh at the time we didn't really
(10:10) recognize we were just so happy to see the Soviet Union fall and we thought okay fine we're we're okay now everything's going to be so much better
(10:17) now you look back the people were fighting today we were supporting in the fight against the Soviets and then after
(10:24) this Al-Qaeda and other extremist organizations were formed from the Jad
(10:29) and were created through this funding and backing and the Middle East has not seen a day of peace since and it's definitely not to just say that it was
(10:36) all America's fault because they certainly have some problems of their own over there it's more to just say
(10:41) that the United States shouldn't be getting involved in that mess and neither should any other Western Country for that matter but to suggest that the
(10:48) Pax Americana which refers to a period of relative Global Order and stability
(10:53) attributed to the United States being the global power to suggest that's caused peace and stability I mean sure
(10:59) maybe if you live in a western country but I'm sorry and I wish this wasn't the case but the Middle East it has been an
(11:05) absolute disaster for them and also it's been terrible for Libya for example and then as a byproduct of that it's also
(11:11) been horrible for Europe because of the mass migration crisis that has come from the Middle East and that has come from
(11:17) Africa so I really doubt that history will view this as some sort of a period of peace and stability but anyways we'll
(11:24) move on now to the Democrats just desperately coping about the Joe Biden pardons but but would say Brian it does
(11:30) seem extraordinary to me I mean my issue with Joe Biden pardoning his son is not that as a father I don't understand why
(11:36) he wants to stop his son going to prison it was the blatant Lying by him and
(11:42) Karen jeanpierre from the White House Podium which I thought was so damaging to his legacy and to the reputation of
(11:49) his administration the fact that Biden may be moving to to give people blanket
(11:56) immunity against any possible crimes they committed for many years I think is
(12:02) outrageous don't you Piers I think that if you're not looking at it in the context of why it's
(12:08) being done then you're just ignoring reality here the reason that Biden has to consider preemptive pardons for
(12:14) people like Adam Schiff and Liz Cheney is because Donald Trump is storming into office by assembling uh a a justice
(12:22) department and folks around him in the legal Community who have promised to enact a ret Donald Trump's
(12:27) retribution doing it in a vac here yeah but Brian what if
(12:32) they've committed crimes genuinely like Hunter what if they have committed crimes if if if if Adam Schiff has
(12:40) committed crimes he I mean he hasn't there's there's no there's no suggestion that he has how do you know because how
(12:46) do you know that he has I mean rid why pardon him why pardon him is because is
(12:51) because Comm because Donald Trump's FBI director is coming into office with an enemy list why wouldn't you you're
(12:58) saying you're going to manufacture crimes against Shi is that what you're saying you're saying that they're going to manufacture crimes against Shi does
(13:05) that even make sense there were any crimes does that even make sense to you if there were any crimes against Adam
(13:11) Schiff then they would have brought them up at any point unto this point but they haven't and so why paron him then why
(13:17) pardon him yeah then why pardon him makes no sense your logic is totally flawed here makes no sense it it's not
(13:24) it's not the reason to Pardon him okay Julie let me bring in Julie if you can answer it answer it
(13:29) I I can answer that question because Donald Trump went to Meet the Press yesterday and said Point Blank that he thinks that the January 6 committee
(13:36) committed crimes what crimes I don't know maybe doing their due maybe doing their due diligence stop maybe do maybe
(13:43) doing their due diligence over we have got that c they have let jie hang on they have
(13:49) immunity they hang J I want to play the clip so let me play the clip again so we know exactly what you're talking about
(13:55) we played it early we'll play it again this was a committee a big
(14:00) deal they lied and what did they do they deleted and destroyed a whole year and a
(14:07) half worth of testimony do you know that I can't get I think those people committed a major crime and Cheney was
(14:14) behind it and so was Benny Thompson and everybody on that committee we're going to for what they
(14:20) did yeah honestly they should go to jail yeah so is he talking about that so
(14:28) so so so there's no so let's just start preface this none of that is true none
(14:33) of that is because he says it doesn't make it true how do you know how you know how do I know because because I
(14:39) would assume that if because hiss are a very dangerous thing when it comes
(14:45) to you saying that Donald Trump's justice department is going to manufacture evidence of crimes or aren't
(14:52) you because if they're not you have no reason to Pardon these people I really well you're not really answering the
(14:58) question you're going a tribe well you're not letting me answer you're you're not letting me answer the question answer but be hear it okay well
(15:07) actually thank you so much for telling me how to speak I think that Donald Trump just sent a very
(15:15) big message to Pam Bondi as to what he expects and he expects her to start
(15:20) invest and to K Patel to start investigating these people whether they get indicted or not it doesn't matter it
(15:26) is expensive it is consuming and it becomes a huge pain in the you know what to be investigated by the federal
(15:33) authorities and that is the message that he is sending the Russian knows full well that there is nothing that's been
(15:38) destroyed because had it been destroyed his lawyers would have filed a motion
(15:44) jul where they could investigate they were not in a position to do that what is being moted is that there are going
(15:50) to be blanket immunities against any crime that may have been committed which does I'm afraid prompt the question what
(15:57) are they hiding why are you so if there's literally nothing there wrong why do you need blanket
(16:06) immunity because you have a justice department that was just told in very clear terms by Donald Trump to the
(16:13) people that he's putting in there whom he considers to be his loyalists that he believes that these people committed
(16:18) Crimes by investigating him that is what they are looking into not that they
(16:24) might have smoked pot back in 1974 in college why would you need a driven
(16:29) drunk in 1983 for what yeah but why would you need a party for that makes no sense so
(16:36) TR even if TR hang on hang on hang on let me ask the question let me ask the question even if it were the case that
(16:42) Trump wanted to open an investigation as to whether or not there was foul play during the previous administration's
(16:49) investigations of him uh why in the world would this require a pardon to
(16:54) these people that makes no sense to me at all why would there be a requirement of because why do these people because
(17:01) why do these people need to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees on dealing with BS which is
(17:10) part of their oversight duties to have done they were members of Congress what are you talking about so
(17:17) we just can't investigate anybody because could could be part of their don't it is part it is part listen do
(17:23) you understand how it works have you ever worked on the hill because I can tell you they have immunity
(17:28) as senators and Congress people to do their oversight responsibilities there is I thought you
(17:34) just said a second ago that there's going to be hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees now you're backtracking on that because of course
(17:40) you'll have to go because because you're going to have to go hire lawyers to be able to prove that this was part of
(17:48) their over you said they had immunity like you can't have it both ways here Jesus do you understand how this works
(17:54) you have to get a lawyer to go to court to tell a judge all of this so they don't obviously don't understand how it
(17:59) works you you obviously I'm sorry do you not understand what I'm getting here specifically because I don't understand
(18:06) why these people need to have a pardon because they might be investigated for potential crimes they may have committed
(18:13) say they have nothing to worry about crimes why you need the pardon it makes no sense Brian Brian hang on hang on
(18:20) don't all talk at once please Brian you say what are the crimes that's the point we don't know and we may you're looking
(18:27) for crimes Donald Trump is looking for crimes because he doesn't like Liz Cheney and that and the fact that she
(18:32) did he genuinely believes he genuinely believes she committed crimes here's the
(18:39) point to Julie's exact point you first of all what crimes second of all it costs money to get lawyer to get legal
(18:46) representation to go prove all of this stuff and third of all it's moot be it's moot because all of these people have
(18:51) immunity anyway you are allowed to act in your oversight capacity in Congress and the Senate to to to pass legislation
(18:58) to care when Trump had to spend on lawyers you didn't care about that law was broken yeah you're right they can't
(19:04) break the law but there was no law that was broken but it doesn't change the facts why do you need an all-encompassing immunity if you've
(19:11) never broken La why you all-encompassing immunity if there's no law I don't I don't know let me bring let me bring in
(19:17) Vinnie I don't know if you guys are playing dumb or not but the fact is playing Dum it cost money to Tove forward with
(19:25) this I'm actually playing Devil's Advocate I what happened on January 6 was appalling and I I think that a lot
(19:32) of people paved extremely badly and a lot of them should have gone to prison which they did I think maybe it was
(19:37) overdone and some of them got ridiculously long sentences but I thought the point that Trump made about
(19:42) the hypocrisy and double standard of how for example the BLM riers were treated
(19:49) with the devastating damage that they caused I thought was a very good point and I think again you it comes back to
(19:54) the hypocrisy right it Democrats cheered on the B M riers that was all in the
(20:00) cause of tackling racism but here you have people who believe they were standing up for democracy I don't agree
(20:06) that they were right they shouldn't have been doing it but there was a double Julie Julie hang on Julie there was a
(20:11) double stand there was a double standard in how the different types of protesters got treated there was Piers Piers if
(20:20) you're suggesting that Democrats cheered on BLM riers no who they gave them entire
(20:27) cities to destroy what they gave them the riers you're saying the Democratic
(20:34) party cheered them on yes really you're saying
(20:42) saying cheered on buing they were saying it was a peaceful
(20:48) protest you're delusional me where Nancy Pelosi at the time was saying that show me where show
(20:55) me where Joe Biden buting on KNE so the great thing about
(21:03) having Andrew on the PE Morgan podcast and really getting a cat amongst the pigeons here is that obviously he's a
(21:08) really good debater but more specifically he does this thing that the people on the peers Morgan show and in
(21:13) the mainstream don't really necessarily tend to do and that's actually listen really closely to what your opponent is
(21:20) saying and then dismantle their logic I mean normally the people on this panel and especially the libs on this panel
(21:26) are really not the brightest bulbs so it should be light work for him and normally what these shows tend to turn
(21:31) into is people just having a screaming match and trying to get their clippable moments and trying to get their viral
(21:37) moments and trying to win the debate in this short period of time but actually if you can listen to what your
(21:43) opponent's saying and be really clinical and deliver your message in a really concise way then I think that that's a
(21:48) lot more impressive so anyways the cope continues now and this lib gets a little
(21:54) bit of a slap around when Andrew does a little bit of gloating about the new president when I watched Trump go into
(21:59) nraam every eye was on him he has Superstar power I saw it myself when he
(22:05) first got elected in Davos when all the world leaders were down there the moment Trump came in it was pandemonium he is
(22:11) the biggest star on the world stage by a country mile and there's something about
(22:18) America right now getting its Swagger back which I can tell you in a country
(22:24) like mine where it feels like the opposite is happening a lot of people are like you know what whatever you
(22:29) think of trump whatever comes out of his mouth all the usual stuff I quite like
(22:34) the confidence that America now seems to be exuding and I wish we had a bit of it
(22:41) here well Pierce I think if you look at what the rest of the world actually thinks about Donald Trump the vast
(22:46) majority of them don't view him as some as some Gauzy figure with a lot of swagger I mean he has very different now
(22:53) negative he has negative it's very different to 2016 I can tell you it has definitely changed that I don't agree
(23:00) with that reading of it I've spoken to a few senior politicians in various countries and they they've learned to
(23:06) deal with Trump and accept what he is good bad and ugly and there is a respect for the leadership that he shows I mean
(23:13) if you try and think about carela Harris and the kind of leadership she exuded there's just no comparison you look at
(23:19) Biden he can B can't even stay bizarre analys but this peers this is bizarre
(23:25) analysis this is what you think about KLA Harris and and ation that you've had with like two or three people this
(23:30) doesn't this doesn't reflect the vast majority of the world and all of the actual data that we have from the rest
(23:36) of in terms of their views on Donald Trump shows the exact opposite okay let me let me bring in
(23:43) Andrew on that I I think America has its Swagger back now Trump has to deliver
(23:49) and he knows that I spoke to him last week and he knows the challenge ahead of him but he also knows he's got a chance
(23:54) to really reset his legacy uh and become a transformative and potentially great president I think he's got a great
(24:00) chance to do that it'll be down to him and his team but I do think that but I do just think when I watched him in
(24:06) nraam I was like you know he's back and he's swaggering and America looks like it's got someone in charge who's who
(24:13) actually does want to make America great again and people are feeling it yeah well I mean to just listen to
(24:19) the analysis from the uh lib on the panel he says he says immediately well
(24:24) how can you come up with such an analysis based on only talking to two or three people when the whole world hates this guy like he's talked to the whole
(24:31) world right suddenly Pierce Morgan's anecdotal evidence isn't good but his is he's talked to nobody it's not it's not
(24:37) my hang on hang on hang on man hang on it's not your turn it's not your turn lib calm down
(24:44) lib so anyway listen it's very very clear to me very
(24:49) stop let me get it out can I get it out can I get it out before before he start talk ahead so so anyway I'm trying to
(24:57) trying to you're still talking [Laughter] so anyway the point is is like no of
(25:03) course there's a lot of swagger to Donald Trump the American people know that that's why they overwhelmingly
(25:08) voted for the guy that's why he got the popular vote that's why he's winning across the board people overwhelmingly
(25:15) across the globe do actually love this guy they like watching him they like listening to him talk they like hearing
(25:22) his speeches they enjoy this guy when you say America's got a Swagger back that's exactly right Donald Trump
(25:28) presents that don't f with us America First policy that America has been known
(25:34) in the past four and that we all wanted back you can't deny it I mean the scale of the win is what it
(25:40) is well let's let's not go crazy the scale of his win was actually smaller than Joe Biden well hang on he won the
(25:46) popular vote if I said he' win the popular vote if I said six months congratulations if I said 6 months
(25:53) agular V if I said to you 6 months ago Trump will win the popular vote have
(25:58) laughed in my face he won the popular vote the Electoral College the White House the Senate the house of
(26:04) representes he won all five I mean if you can't call that a massive win what
(26:09) is it no no I I'm not Democrats did not
(26:15) royally well can I speak or do you want to keep interrupting flat earther listen here's the way I look at it Democrats
(26:21) screwed up Democrats don't know how to communicate I've been bangging the drum on this since 2015 if not since Trump
(26:28) came down the escalator he's a master Communicator to his base and Democrats don't know how to speak to normal people
(26:35) we always speak and we lecture like we're from the podium at you know Harvard Law School so you won't get an argument for me I will tell you that
(26:42) whether it's macron or anybody in your government peers or or Vladimir Putin or
(26:47) anybody else they have psychological profiles on Donald Trump like every like
(26:53) we do and all other world leaders as well and they understand exactly how to get what they want out of Donald Trump
(26:58) and they know that flattery will get you everywhere with Donald Trump all will be forgiven if you flatter him macron knows
(27:05) that well that's why he engages the way he engages with him that's why Putin engages the way he engages with him
(27:10) that's why half of half of the people like like like his own vice president who thought he was basically the second
(27:16) coming of Adolf Hitler and I'm not paraphrasing here now know that if they bend the knee and if they flatter him
(27:23) that all will be forgiven and he will listen to them and he will take them into his confidence and if you're macron
(27:28) you're in a country that is very dependent on American NATO umbrella if
(27:33) you're in a country that is trying to hold the EU together if you're trying to hold a Western Alliance together against
(27:39) an encroaching newly aggressive Vladimir Putin or maybe not so newly aggressive
(27:45) you understand that the weight of the weight of Trump's heart is to invite him to notredam to give him a seat pretty
(27:52) much next to Prince William or wherever he was sitting and to make him the star of the show because that is what Trump
(27:58) wants to do and wants to be so this is not a surprise to me it's a smart move by Micon to do that it's a smart move by
(28:05) she to do that in China look he all of a sudden went from threatening to Nuke North Korea to becoming best friends
(28:12) with the North Koreans because the leader of North Korea decided to flatter him I mean what did North Korea what did
(28:18) North Korea okay but what did North Korea China or Russia do on Trump's watch in his first four
(28:24) years what did North Korea what did they what they do Trump's watch what do they do are you suggest are you suggest well
(28:32) they didn't need to do anything because by the way theing his technique of
(28:37) actually having civil relations with these people is wrong and Korea damaging
(28:44) developed North where the evidence he didn't work North Korea continue North Korea continued to
(28:49) develop missiles China continued to develop its military for potential attack on bid and all under Biden that's
(28:58) the point isn't it they've all carried on the exactly the same you has the complete opposite way it says they're
(29:03) all enemies so a great debut there by Andrew he did extremely well and he
(29:09) destroyed them so badly that she had to resort to calling him a flat earther oh
(29:14) really offensive stuff and not even Little Brian laughed but to be fair he was probably still licking his wounds
(29:21) and trying his hardest not to be back in the firing line after being silenced in
(29:26) just the funniest way quietly stop talking next time I want to hear Andrew say silence lib and I want to see
(29:33) them heed that call I want him to say silence lib and just see the reaction so anyway guys love to see it not one step
