(1:41) payments there you go welcome to uh Ash Wednesday and uh we do have Captain Morgan CEO here how are you sir doing
(1:47) well how are you that's enough i'm not smoking don't jump on our guest this is supposed to be relaxed and you see all
(1:52) the tension you just created i didn't create any tension andrew Wilson how are you totally uncomfortable now i'm sorry
(1:58) totally uncomfortable now i'm doing well thank you for having me by the way to the Crucible crew just enjoying some
(2:04) vodka and soda right their crew brought it in brought in a nice cigar treated us
(2:09) really well rolled out the red carpet fantastic show I must tell you yeah well just careful cuz afterwards we're having
(2:15) an Eyes Wide Shut party and I have a mask custom fitted for you my friend you give him the password right nope no password so uh before we go on
(2:25) before we go I thought you said those for props for a skit bro well we method act we're going to Daniel
(2:33) D lewis this um I want you to uh for people who are new to you and I think a
(2:39) lot of people have seen you know your uh your arguments I guess I should say or debates uh particularly like on Pierce Morgan Tommy Lair we have a clip from
(2:44) that how would you um characterize yourself because now things are you know there's the red pill movement and people
(2:51) think of that you know some people conflate the whatever podcast the fit and fresh Andrew Tate black pill they
(2:56) throw it all in one pot so if you were to sort of clarify for them how would you descri Yeah well I can untangle a
(3:01) bunch of that so my view I'm a Christian ethicist and I focused on politics and
(3:09) specifically politics um I do get in the realm of apologetics occasionally but you could say that I'm far right
(3:16) moderately dissident right something in there uh I don't associate myself as
(3:21) being red pill uh or even part of the manosphere though I do do a lot of debates inside of the manosphere and get
(3:26) along really well with those guys because I've tried to understand their positions and they have some really good ones mhm but to untangle what these
(3:32) views are um the Christian rights constantly tangling with the manosphere
(3:38) because they purposely refuse to listen to anything they have to say yes and twist it and destroy it the red pill is
(3:46) is as Rolo Tomasi calls it a praxiology i I wouldn't call it a praxiology but
(3:52) what I would say is it's a data packet so think of everything that is red pill
(3:57) related just being in a file and handed to somebody it's a series of descriptors not prescriptors right there's no
(4:03) prescriptions just describing reality what you do with it from there is up to you right right and so what's happened
(4:10) is pickup artists have picked up this file and now it's going to help them teach men how to get right or
(4:16) another guy picks up this file right and he says "Oh well this can help uh help
(4:21) men you know with their dating." other guys pick up this file and they're like "Wait there's some human dynamics here
(4:27) which we're really missing out on uh that could really be helpful for men's rights and to advocate for men's rights
(4:33) that a lot of people don't really know about." And so they go that angle right and so it's the the red pill itself is
(4:40) not actually an ideology it's an idea of descriptors and then there's ideologues
(4:47) which will use the descriptors to back up whatever their ideology is right and we had uh actually the film Red Pill uh
(4:53) from Cassie J a long time ago and Karen Strawn early on in the show like in the gosh I want to say 2014 2015 we went
(4:58) through the suffragettes um and so the term red pill was around i think what
(5:04) you're saying in kind of a different way that I describe it is you look at some of these movements now where they do have prescriptions they're right in
(5:09) diagnosing the problem and sometimes incorrect with the answer for example some people their prescription is sleep
(5:15) with as many as possible so you know which one are hoes and I would think that as as Christians believing Christians we're like "Ah it's probably
(5:21) not good because it's destructive to your soul." But there recognizing the problem of promiscuity in the breakdown of gender norms and I think it's a good
(5:27) way to put it description or descriptors versus prescripttors i will say one thing you do better than anyone anyone
(5:34) out there um and has caught my attention is um lasering in on questions where it
(5:39) comes down to this we know what the fundamental duties are of men um we know what our rights are let's get past that
(5:45) discussion but no one wants to define what that is for women and ultimately if people think that's offensive you can
(5:51) scream until you're blue in the face young men are checking out they're not getting married and that's not good for our country that's not good for a birth
(5:57) rate that's not good for our society so do we want to deal with the offense that is the reason for men checking out or do
(6:03) we want to simply leave it at well that's offensive we don't want to ever place duties on women yeah so I mean
(6:09) this is the fundamental question so let's let's take everything every type of political ideology you can think of
(6:16) every type of ideology you can think of and just put them in a series of propositions logical propositions if we
(6:22) take a bird's eye view of all of the world here's what the world really is
(6:27) it's a series and sequence of men who are killing each other over resources and land okay that's what every nation
(6:35) is that's what every tribe is today it could be over kicks yeah it could be over it could be over whatever right but
(6:40) fundamentally that really is what's going on now men intuitively actually understand this in fact they don't even
(6:46) have a problem with this where they're like "Yep it's going to be our tribe and your tribe that's the way it is." Right you don't even really have to describe
(6:52) this reality for them because they just understand that that's the reality because of that what has happened is
(6:59) it's false to the duty of the stronger sex to protect women and the weaker sex i completely agree that that is true but
(7:06) also it falls to them the duty of procurement of resources the refinement of resources the distribution of
(7:11) resources and this is at the political level down the distribution of resources so that's all politicians ever fight
(7:17) about all day every day non-stop so if we're in the distribution phase right men have procured this and you know
(7:24) they're distributing it and it's women and children who are the primary beneficiaries of it and not men we know
(7:29) what our duties are they're very complete and they're not very complex yeah protectors provider right and
(7:35) that's how you demonstrate we're the protectors and providers lover yeah so what so what well so what are women what
(7:41) are their duties so here's my question i'll ask you what is what is a woman's duty what are her duties that are on par
(7:47) with that of men well hold on a second before Gerald answers i think you did a good job cuz you put him on the spot i'll give you time to think about it i
(7:53) think you did a a really good job of and this is something that you also address overt feminism versus covert feminism
(7:58) you were on Pierce Morgan with Tommy Lair and a lot of people ran the clip where you know there was some back and forth kind of dunking snippy but a lot
(8:04) of people missed this macro point that you made which I think is the crux of it so I believe I'm a There we go again
(8:11) pierce I'm a woman of virtue i happen to be independently successful i have a husband who's not only a former
(8:16) professional athlete but is currently a professional baseball coach so is he not a masculine man i mean I'm confused here
(8:24) what's your concept of a masculine man mine is a man who respects me yeah that misses the point though like you're
(8:30) still not contending with the argument that you're saying inside of society right this second right masculinity is
(8:36) not only punished but also women on the right covert feminists on the right are constantly and consistently talking
(8:42) about how they need to have privilege in society i want men their version of masculinity is men who take care of us
(8:48) men who protect us men who do all of this those are all duties that men have towards women great what are the duties
(8:54) that women have towards men what are the duties that women have towards anything what do men get out of this arrangement
(9:01) what are we getting out of this arrangement can you tell me i mean you would argue that menately should I
(9:07) interrupt you hang on one second let Tommy are born that way let Tommy respond to that and then I'll come to you Jez then Sean you've been waiting
(9:13) patiently so most men are born to be protectors and providers i can't imagine
(9:18) my dad saying you know what to my mom you know what i'm not going to be a protector and a provider unless you do
(9:24) this that's not how real men operate real men are protectors and providers
(9:29) and they marry women who hopefully have but also bring a lot to the table as well that are great mothers great wives
(9:37) caretakers of the home there's nothing wrong with being a traditional wife and mother you're misunderstanding me if you
(9:42) think that I think that women should just be out doing whatever they want i think that there are gender roles to be
(9:48) respected but I don't think a man needs to get something out of it to be a manly man a protector and a provider if you
(9:54) think you need to get something out of it I quite frankly don't consider you a real man okay um so a lot to unpack
(10:03) there as people say um I will say you do need uh to provide something for him to be a manly man for and solely dedicated
(10:11) to you i think that's a fundamental misunderstanding yeah should it be a man in society but one dedicated to you full
(10:16) disclosure Tommy Luren if you've watched the show for uh a signed period of time has been on i have no ill will toward Tommy Luren just think that that was a a
(10:23) seminal moment here in this movement because you've been often misrepresented sometimes he just dunks on horse
(10:30) although when in Rome every now and then yeah uh but that's not what you're about you really uh you are I hate to use the
(10:35) term educator because it sounds so self-important legician would be a good one there you go okay and you've talked about the way you approach it so yeah so
(10:41) focused legician focusing from the Christian ethics side the reason that this is obviously controversial and
(10:47) stunlocking for people is because they expect uh you know Christians to be to
(10:52) act in a very effeminite way because the masculinity of Christianity especially
(10:58) in the Protestant side has been completely sucked out by these blood blood circling viperous sewing circle
(11:05) Christians is what I call them and they're covert feminists that's a long name yeah i I was like looking for a bunch of
(11:11) adjectives to lace together we could maybe just like bumper cigarette to shrill that's where
(11:17) that works but no but I I I understood so you were asking him before yeah so like what is and I thought this was a
(11:24) really important question that I hadn't really thought as much about until I saw that clip with you and Tommy i was like
(11:29) man this this is this goes right to the heart of some of the things that I've been thinking about and talking with my wife about wouldn't it be great if
(11:34) somebody was articulating that for women today because it seems to be a huge disconnect and you you can go back
(11:39) biblically and go "Okay well what does the Bible kind of say about this?" this well it's obviously you know having children and and raising children but
(11:45) there's other stuff too like when you read Proverbs 31 it doesn't mean that the wife is just sitting at home barefoot pregnant and waiting for the
(11:51) husband to come home and beat her up like there's she does a lot of stuff in that you know and does things for the family you know so I I would say my
(11:58) answer would that Tommy probably should have said "Okay is that what you get out of it is children right i have the children and I will be a mom to those
(12:04) children i'll be faithful i'll take care of the home and I will be a good wife to you as well as a good mother." Maybe some other stuff but and are women
(12:10) having children not well the birth rate would suggest otherwise so so then it appears like perhaps they're failing at
(12:15) their duty right so if a woman brings this up as a duty right and knows that you can counter by saying like for in
(12:21) Tommy Lawrence particular case does she have children well think so i don't think so and so the thing is is like you
(12:29) know a lot of these women the reason they can't utilize this as an answer is because they don't live up to the very duty duty expectation that they
(12:36) themselves would uh permeate to other people right i agree with you i think that child birth is uniquely a thing i
(12:44) mean only women can do this and it puts them in a position of privilege in society uh and we put them there because
(12:51) they need to be protected right but what do we get here we're supposed to be getting the children and we're supposed to be getting the mom for the children
(12:57) and the beautiful wife and the women of great virtues as I brought up Tommy Lauren the reason this was uh such kind
(13:03) of a kill shot for against her is because what she said was men innately
(13:09) want to just do this for us so what does she do she instantly assigns herself and
(13:15) all women privilege we instantly put ourselves in a position of privilege versus men it's innate for you Steven
(13:23) that you want to buy me nice and then watch me put it on like you're privileged you're priv you're privileged
(13:30) you don't you want me to be happy buying nice and you get to provide it
(13:36) you're doing your like you're doing exactly what a real man's supposed to do and I'm doing exactly what a woman have
(13:41) to tell you you're a horrible salesman you really are and by the way it's not so much the putting on as the taking off that's the
(13:47) fun part so let's just be clear come on let's be just be honest here wherever disagreements exist that's a crowd-pleaser with your wife right um
(13:53) let me Okay so that is and it was fascinating to me i will say I don't want to keep going back to it that no
(13:58) one answered not even the uh the the homosexual sort of ally in there no one on that show answered at any point and
(14:06) when when they were asked they still kept coming back to what was clearly an expected duty of men all the time and
(14:13) men are checking and what's the very first thing they always say and you'll see it on every single uh kind of feminist exchange I have you're not a
(14:20) real man right so you get to make the determination on what men are or not aren't right now what if I said this
(14:26) back to you oh you can't have children you're not a real woman how would that go over wouldn't go oh it really
(14:33) probably wouldn't go over very well right but if they assigned that as a duty that that women ought to be moving
(14:39) towards it doesn't mean every woman can have kids they can't we know this but they also should not be trying to
(14:44) provide an environment where other women are not they should not be moving in society towards a lack of child birth
(14:51) but facilitating other women having children and families even if they themselves can't and we wouldn't like
(14:57) count them out you wouldn't say "Oh you had a hyerectomy because you had cancer you're not a woman anymore that's not
(15:03) what of course that's ridiculous." But what we would say is if you've had the hyerectomy right and you can't have
(15:09) children you know that sucks but you should still be in society trying to create the conditionals so that other
(15:15) women can yeah right instead of trying Yeah instead of trying to to agitate against it uh or promote against it you
(15:22) should be trying to at least lay the groundwork down so that other women can fulfill their duties and how do I know this because that's exactly what men are
(15:29) expected to do you're in a wheelchair you can't work right you can't provide security resources things like this you
(15:35) still have an obligation right to at least attempt to facilitate so that others can right right so that you're
(15:42) not getting in the way of other people doing that and you're still promoting in society that they can and if you don't right you're considered a piece of
(15:48) right right you're now you're just a crippled piece of
(15:53) they don't tell you that part about Lieutenant Man yeah they got no legs yeah you piece of now you're just a crippled people well hold on has just as
(16:01) a followup has anybody not obviously Tom of the Ren because I don't think she has but has anybody else articulated that to
(16:07) you in private or some conversations how is How is that possible because it really is the only logical answer that
(16:13) you can have people Well first of all people don't think and secondly there was a feminist on this um on another
(16:20) Pierce Morgan feminist panel i did the Dunkin Donuts panel where the feminist did say why not make women have an
(16:27) obligation to have children until I pressed her on it and then suddenly that obligation she was like "Well okay maybe
(16:33) not right maybe I don't actually think that." Backed away from it very quickly and it was all back to what men's
(16:38) responsibility to women are right women's responsibilities have been completely thrown off of them since
(16:45) since the sexual liberation right since uh especially the 60s and 70s the entire
(16:50) thing was the removal of patriarchy so if you're going to be a victim class even though you outnumber men but you're
(16:56) still the victim class right well then who are your victimizers well it can only be men right so it's if men are in
(17:03) charge of systems that's what patriarchy is so women when you're talking about feminism and covert feminism do you see
(17:09) right-wing women do this all the time where they try to get an egalitarian cast right we want egalitarianism with
(17:17) men at the highest echelons highest levels well that necessarily displaces male power therefore displacing
(17:23) patriarchy and you as a conservative woman are supposed to be for patriarchy you're supposed to want there to be
(17:29) patriarchy inside the household that's what you advocate for but not in government somehow men are okay to rule
(17:34) their household but the second they're in charge of the planet then it's a problem it's like what are you talking about
(17:41) if only female world leaders there'd be no wars yeah except Except here's the here's part of that red pill packet
(17:47) descriptors right there's some famous studies which were done that went back and looked at queens and looked at kings and turns out when queens were in charge
(17:54) there was more war yeah not less war and the myth of the matriarchy anyway has
(17:59) been completely reduced to rubble there's never been a matriarchy in all of human history ever anywhere now
(18:05) qualify that what do you what do you mean so patriarchy is from the father right most of the time everything is
(18:10) done uh through uh what what are called patrineal means so from from father to sons you know this is the chains of
(18:17) power there have been queens right but the entire governing body is not women the entire the entirety of the governing
(18:24) body is always men everywhere all the time and essentially it always has to be that way because we have the monopoly on
(18:30) force so if you look back through history you'll see the dumb liberals will say things like "Well in the the
(18:36) Rapjo tribe of the Navajos and the you know blah blah we it's a black comic."
(18:41) Yeah yeah we had uh it was a pure matriarchy where women were in charge and then you look into it and you find
(18:47) out this is based on progressive uh nonsense verbal history right this comes
(18:54) down to verbal history and you go okay well how come it wasn't in our recorded history when we actually started dealing
(19:00) with this tribe how come the men were making all the decisions in the chiefs right oh well that was because of
(19:05) colonialism how come there's no recorded history of these matriarchies because they never existed and these people are
(19:12) frauds and what they do is they say well there's a verbal history right um and
(19:17) that's what proves it it's like well where's the ain't that like women to always be happy yeah where's the where's the anthropology speaking of that women
(19:24) being happy well you know what they pull the same i just want to say they pull the same thing with the gender stuff too they go well there are plenty of societies you go okay name one and they
(19:30) go to some Native American tribe where they were like I guess you could kind of act like a lady history it's through our
(19:36) oral history and it's like yeah so you can't prove any of this history probably wouldn't have such a problem with Yeah
(19:41) exactly well and speaking of the other thing you just said and this is this is interesting you're talking about um when
(19:49) you're talking about the idea of women's happiness there's been two comprehensive metaanalysis studies uh which have been
(19:56) done piggybacking off each other which study women all over the world and regardless of the conditions they're in
(20:02) doesn't matter what regardless of the conditions no matter how egalitarian no matter how not egalitarian no matter if
(20:08) they're in all the positions of power or not in a comparative analysis they're always less happy than men always so
(20:15) basically it's just like even in the conclusions of these studies it says you just can't make women happy you just
(20:21) can't well that would also go to the psychological profiles right like Jordan Peterson talks about this have your differences but inre you know higher
(20:28) level of neurosis you know the the idea of a mom being a worrier and some could say that's a biological sort of
(20:33) evolutionary mechanism right to be worrying to be on alert because a part of your job in a tribe for example be to
(20:39) alert those who could thwart the threat where you can't deal with it yourself so so it makes sense in other words that's not shouldn't be offensive we go women
(20:45) tend to worry more and be slightly more anxious well I mean none of this should be offensive to anybody right it's it in
(20:51) fact I I say that most of this is just like blatantly obvious to the observer it's like if you ask a person who's
(20:58) stronger men or women right and they go well you know I'm not really sure it's like just based on what you observe you
(21:05) know just like when you're walking down the street and person lift up heavy do they usually have a penis or not
(21:11) right you know and it's like well well you know okay yeah they they mostly have you can cut those off these days
(21:18) exceptions right because there's some women who are stronger than men that's not what I'm talking about well and the thing that's so funny about that is it's
(21:24) like I can see the point of course there's there's plenty of women out there who are stronger than some men i'm
(21:30) not I'm not disputing that right so what the the exception is what proves the
(21:35) rule right that's what proves the rules it's like because you have to point to an exception you're saying there's a
(21:40) rule right or how do we get an exception to it right no you're exactly let me ask you this because you talk about this and
(21:45) and I think people right now are probably going to go along to say "Okay logically that makes sense." The idea of the duty we've absolved
(21:51) society especially uh with the sort of the rise the ascent of feminism of duties but let me ask this on a personal
(21:57) level because ultimately we do want to get to solutions on a personal level on a day-to-day basis uh I don't know what
(22:03) the numbers right now i think it's 30 something% of of women are going to be single and young men are uninterested in
(22:08) getting married and that number by 20 30 something I think it's it's going to be close to 50% i've depending on which
(22:14) numbers you use so that's closer to 65% in 25 years right so that's going the
(22:20) wrong way yeah so on an individual basis what would you identify as the primary
(22:25) problem or what creates the hesitancy the sort of reticent nature from men to
(22:31) get into that dating sphere cuz a lot of men are checking out what needs to be
(22:36) resolved there for men to say "Okay let me have let me give this another go." Yeah there's two primary problems and u
(22:42) anybody can look this up with a cursory Google search it's not even hard information to find the first is in all
(22:47) western nations the second you hit industrialization and you start promoting uh that women go to college
(22:54) and defer their childbearing years for college years right you end up with an
(22:59) aging uh with an aging populace for women your birth rates they just nose
(23:05) dive it doesn't matter where doesn't matter where why is that so uh ineffective especially for men well by
(23:12) the time imagine you take women and And you not only are telling them to defer
(23:17) their best childbearing years in college but what is college it's not like they're going to women's colleges right
(23:24) they're going to co-ed colleges and what happens there it's basically a den of iniquity and degeneracy right so they're
(23:29) going getting their face planted in a pillow and road hard for about four years then they go out into career world
(23:36) do the exact same thing play the field for another 3 years then by the time they're 30 they want to settle down and give you 1.5 kids now I don't know about
(23:43) you but I don't think most men want a chick who's been plowed 25 times before they get to him right and then uh marry
(23:51) that woman right for the luxury of having reasonably unhealthy children
(23:56) that's why you see such a rise in autism is aging population of women the average child birth now 28 28 you go back uh
(24:05) just just 40 years right average was about 1920 right right that's where we
(24:11) want it to be we want it to be in the healthiest years of women for two for two reasons one the health of the child
(24:17) way way better and the health of the mother women who have babies in their 30s have a really hard time recovering
(24:22) women who have babies in their 20s you ever seen that like they have the baby and the next day they're back at work
(24:27) it's like it's not even a big It's just like a hangover yeah i I I tell people think of it like a hangover when I was
(24:34) 20 and I got really really really drunk the next day I was at work and didn't even think about it right but when I
(24:41) went and drank too much when I was 30 I called in right right your body just doesn't have that same to be fair i do
(24:48) think there's also uh sort of a contributing factor there increased diagnoses in autism because everyone is on the spectrum now but yes they both
(24:54) contribute significantly so are let me I I see that you've identified a problem the problem there are you are you saying
(24:59) that the solution and I know the second one but if we go to solution there is it as a society we need to stop placing
(25:04) importance on college degrees for women and start placing importance on exemplary women and what kind of I I'll
(25:11) tell you both solutions let me give you the second part though this is the this is the worst part is
(25:17) localization so before the internet right how would you meet people well
(25:22) you'd meet them at work or at church socials or through friends or things like that local right you weren't really
(25:28) dating 500 miles away cuz who the hell did you know there's nobody in your circuit to even introduce you so uh Bob
(25:34) and Sally from the same town met each other right and there really wasn't that many other people you know you selected
(25:40) from what the pool was that was there and that was it monogamy worked really good for that right everybody basically
(25:46) was able to get and select a partner mhm well let's fast forward now and now we have the problem of uh mate selection
(25:53) hypergamy or what's referenced as hypergamy it's just it's basically is pretty simple if you're a woman and you
(25:59) have a superpower right which they do at about the ages of 17 roughly through 26
(26:05) 27 where men will literally uh you know castrate themselves to have sex with
(26:10) them right they will do insane things in order to get in these women's pants because of this over overarching kind of
(26:16) biological need to uh sleep with beautiful women right well women within
(26:22) that age range they're very marketable that way right so when they go and
(26:27) they're like they get slip in the DMs of a very famous man for instance and he's like hey I'll fly you out right then
(26:34) they get wooed and he bangs them right and then they think that that's the type of men they can get as a husband as a
(26:41) husband or as a long-term mating partner and they can't and so now they have a
(26:47) they have trouble making sex selection uh or making correct sexual selections for themselves because they feel like
(26:54) they're in a league they're not actually in because men will sleep with you when you have that superpower doesn't mean that they'll marry you right right so
(27:01) localization is a massive issue so what happens when you have uh 20% of the men
(27:07) who are the ones who are the the women all of the women are mostly going for right well that doesn't leave a lot for
(27:15) everybody else that's why the same men areing 10 different you know 10 different chicks 13 different chicks uh
(27:21) this type of thing and this is why these women will ride the carousel and they're not settling down till they're 30 i also
(27:28) just make up your own terms there's also something there's also something in there I think not that you're glossing over it but it's quite important let's
(27:34) say I mean let's just say for example like uh let's say it's LeBron James i'm just saying like a famous person right okay there is the problem of okay now
(27:41) someone thinks that they have LeBron as a husband right that level of status but
(27:46) there may be I'm just using this as an example I'm not talking down uh I'm not talking crap on LeBron they sort of
(27:51) overlook some other facets that hey he may not actually bring the qualities to the table that you want in a husband
(27:56) this may just be a guy who's super famous super rich high status but you take that good and you go
(28:01) oh yeah but by the way he's never gotten married and by the way maybe he has never actually been someone who's uh
(28:07) valued fidelity then you have a guy who does isn't LeBron James and you just see what's lacking and I see that quite a
(28:12) bit well let me to give you a little push back here let's let's evaluate it from a different angle it is the case
(28:20) that you at least need to be attracted to the person that you're going to end up with right mhm if that's the case um
(28:28) that you need to have attraction well I mean like what other things are you
(28:34) willing to look over so that you can have the thing that that you for men especially visual right attractiveness
(28:41) what else are you willing to gloss over can she be a stupid yeah maybe she can can she be crazy
(28:49) probably the crazy high scale exists for a reason could she you know could she like could she kind of be a god- aful
(28:55) person and aing embarrassment well yeah but she's really hot right so it's like
(29:01) so when it comes to attraction though we've missed that aspect for women right that women are not attracted to that
(29:06) many men and so there they when you say like husband qualities right oh sure they they'll even grant all these qual
(29:13) like they make spreadsheets and flowheets for different men who are in their rosters right they'll be like "He you know he's he would be a great
(29:19) provider he'd be this he'd be that and I'll keep him around till we're in our 30s and if there's nobody else around
(29:24) who's good-looking hey I'll settle with him." You know that's that's fine you know what I mean he can be he can be that guy but what happens when it's an
(29:32) attractive guy who also happens to be a piece of well just like men they're probably going to select for the
(29:38) attractive i'm not disagreeing what I'm saying is so give you an example i know a a story of a woman who was a side side
(29:43) piece okay to a very successful man all right and uh he bought her I believe it was like a Maybach or something and then
(29:50) she ends up getting remarried they end up getting divorced but they would get into arguments and she would say like well you know what you don't do an XYZ
(29:55) it's like yeah but that guy was doing it because you were his side piece and he didn't want his wife to know right but she was bringing where this guy was
(30:01) basically fighting a phantom like yeah yeah yeah but this is actually this is not that you're not a side this is now a marriage and so it brings a a litany of
(30:08) complications as well where you pick the good and you sort of forget the bad or what was lacking and that yeah it goes
(30:13) back to the point it's just a different way I guess of addressing they think that this is a marriage when in fact it's a fling and the threshold is very
(30:20) very different for men it doesn't make it right it doesn't mean that it's right for those guys to be sleeping with a bunch of women and destroying them for
(30:25) future marriages but that is a reality and women will often willingly destroy themselves and it's a problem look at
(30:31) look at look at it like an X-Men superpower that almost virtually all women have when they're between like I
(30:38) said the ages of like 17 through you know 26 27 and then it kind of just goes
(30:43) away once they meet the wall right and the wall always wins so they But through
(30:50) those years doors magically open for them gifts magically show up right i
(30:55) mean dinners just magically paid for it's literally a superpower but men
(31:01) don't really have this superpower except a few so put yourself in that situation like think of it objectively from that
(31:07) situation you're a very good-looking and successful man who can sleep with
(31:12) whatever beautiful women you want is it really so hard to envision that if you could like that was just dropped on your
(31:19) lap wouldn't you use it i think the answer most men would be like "Yeah it's
(31:25) just that we're not really ever presented with that most of us right it's very few of us who are." And women
(31:30) on the other hand have that superpower for a little while almost all of them and that's why you breed such
(31:36) narcissistic women right because they can essentially sleep with whatever man they want um whether they get married or
(31:41) not but men can't do the same right so Brian Atlas on whatever he makes this point often he says I would argue that
(31:48) if I can sleep with a woman she's definitely going to want to date me but you can't make the argument back that if
(31:55) you can sleep with a man he's definitely going to want to date you because a man's going to sleep with you basically
(32:01) all you got to do is show up and open your legs right yes but it's not the same case for men sometimes not even that let me ask you uh so the solutions
(32:09) yeah solutions are the solutions okay as a society we need to determine what is exemplary and that is not right now the
(32:16) course is go to college be independent from a man because you don't want to be trapped become a working professional
(32:21) establish yourself right so I'm assuming that the solution is the opposite of that and then uh what would be the solution to the next one of uh so you
(32:27) start with uh propaganda we've been kind of led to believe that bottomup
(32:32) propaganda is the way that it needs to be organic No it doesn't you need top down
(32:38) propaganda like you had in World War II the same way you got women in the factories with Rosie the Riveter is the
(32:43) same way you get them in the household with like you know um uh Susan the housewife right and that's the
(32:49) propaganda that's everywhere the glorification is of Susan the housewife
(32:55) you know what I mean who has the little like thing of cookies and she's always smiling and she's always super happy and
(33:00) her husband's always smile you know what I mean yeah and you make that the trend everywhere and you force it down everybody's throat all day long every
(33:08) day where it becomes practically ingratiated in them that's what you elevate in society you don't even have
(33:14) to outlaw anything it's not even necessary like you don't even have to be like well you can't you know do X
(33:21) behavior if you had a glorification program top down just like you do for government propaganda and warfare it
(33:27) would work beautifully you know you don't even need to tell women they can't go to college you just make the propaganda all about the family unit and
(33:35) that's the thing the government's supporting that's the thing we're pushing for as a society that's the patriotic thing to do so basically
(33:41) exactly how society was before 1960 yes uh and they need a good mask maybe a
(33:46) better mascot like Smokey the Mama Bear only you can prevent burnt casserole something like that you know we we'll work on we we'll sort of we'll
(33:53) whiteboard it and the second one the second issue of women who you know find themselves in a position where okay I've
(33:58) slept with this very attractive very wealthy guy uh and so they're under this delusion that that's their marriage
(34:05) material and it ruins other men how do you how do you solve that issue do we kill all the rich attractive men this is
(34:11) this is the more controversial take the first one's much more easy to demonstrate and prove because we have
(34:18) 200 years of propaganda from the top down which shows you can Philip Morris can definitely get the country to smoke
(34:24) okay we can definitely prove that propaganda works and he was homosexual yeah the second the second Well it
(34:31) wasn't even Philip Morris it was the ad guy but he I mean he did that for multiple in my mind he's Jim Carrey so
(34:37) that's the best of my knowledge but by the way people will say that that's offensive now comment below if you why
(34:42) you think that what he just said is outlandish and offensive because it is easily verifiable that is what we did as
(34:48) a society and not just American society European society you can go back to for many it up nobody was fat I just pointed
(34:56) out when everybody smoked nobody was fat because it was an appetite suppressant yes and by the way you know uh most
(35:03) people who smoke never get lung cancer 90% plus don't get lung cancer and they have heart attacks because they're fat
(35:09) thank god we're and not on YouTube because that would be you you advocated tobacco use correct
(35:15) it also makes you look really cool it does it does so anyway yeah it was a way better society when everybody smoked trust me it was way better it was zapite
(35:22) suppressant it was a great way to greet your friends it was fantastic we it all up but anyway the point is the
(35:27) point is back to this though uh the second the second can only be with Christian ethics so the idea of uh part
(35:36) of this propaganda that you would want to put out is the idea of virtues for women and you can teach virtues for
(35:42) women inside of classrooms right just like we used to teach virtues for women same way we used to teach virtues for
(35:47) men here's what here here's male virtue right here's what men are expected in society here's what you're expected to
(35:53) do here's what you're expected not to do well one big key of of female virtue is
(35:58) what chastity it's chastity yeah so if you're if you're reinforcing chastity
(36:04) you never get put in the position where you're sleeping with a good-looking guy pre-marriage right so you're ruined
(36:10) right but you have to start that young that's a way harder thing to get into the mainstream the idea of virtues what
(36:18) are feminine and what are masculine virtues being pushed at a young age that's what the entire transgender
(36:24) movement was about was the abolishment of virtues masculine and feminine
(36:29) virtues to blend them into the idea that all of these virtues are simply
(36:34) universalized none of them are specific to the sexes but here's why they have to be specific to the sexes because if men
(36:41) are promiscuous it actually does less harm to society than if women are i know
(36:46) that that seems like unfair right but it's true it actually does less mean
(36:53) you're advocating for probability no no no the opposite i always want to make that clear when she says that men should
(36:58) bang and should be virgin no no no no no no both need to have that as a virtue
(37:04) right but if women aren't chased it creates significantly higher problems than if men aren't chased well there's
(37:11) not the same thing there's not the problem of paternity yeah or reproduction or the problem of the the
(37:16) revoling factor so the reason men have such a revoling factor when it comes to high body count very promiscuous women
(37:23) is because that's how we assured paternity through chastity so paternity tests are a modern invention i don't
(37:29) know if people remember this or not so how did you know if the kid that the woman was having was yours well cuz she
(37:35) was onlying you right that's the only way you could assure paternity so if you want to know why men get revolted by
(37:41) high body count women it's actually ingrained inside of men that's how we assured our our prodigy in paternity can
(37:48) I ask you a question though and this is one thing because I agree with everything you just said how much level of push back though for example we
(37:54) showed your clip nick Depal was on the show and Nick Depal has been married for a very long time people see him as this this he's one of the roughest comedians
(38:00) ever lived he's also like he's also a family guy i don't know if he'll get mad at me because I'm destroying his rep um
(38:06) he's pretty boring like he's not a guy on the road snorting coke off lady's hbones a guy go back watches ESPN calls this lady but he said I don't think a
(38:12) lot of guys he's like when I was young I didn't want I don't think a lot of guys want that they don't they're not thinking about a woman having like they want to as many broads as possible
(38:19) there's a huge contingency of guys out there who are outside of sort of this quote unquote red pill sphere how much
(38:25) push back do you think you like what percentage of men do you think would be on board with what you're proposing
(38:32) here's the pro the flaw in his argument he's right right that of force must been
(38:37) preferred to sleep this many women oh I'm shocked they would Is there a study for this what they want to go nail a
(38:44) bunch of ch you know but um here's the counterargument it's really simple most
(38:50) can't and that's it that's all you need to know right so so ultimately most men
(38:56) can't do that so if you think that most men wouldn't prefer to settle down with a woman and have kids right they would
(39:02) because most of them are simply not capable of bagging tons of chicks they're not even capable of doing it but
(39:08) most women are capable of bagging basically as many women as men as they want basically disabuse both sexes of
(39:14) this fantasy solution disabuse men of this fantasy even though we agree it's immoral this fantasy of bagging a bunch
(39:20) of broads like look that's not likely also here's why it's not good long term and disabuse women of the notion hey
(39:26) this idea that you're going to get white knight prince charming multi-millionaire 6'3 six-pack is also not realistic
(39:34) but here's the thing it's like do you remember DARE that stupid ass program in the '90s dare to keep kids off drugs did
(39:40) you ever see that oh I still have never fried an egg yeah yeah yeah well yeah this is your brain this is your break on drugs don't tell me that wasn't
(39:46) effective at keeping kids off drugs it was it was they definitely remembered
(39:51) right yeah remember cuz a girl was cute it was Rachel Lee Cook how is that not propaganda that was 100% propaganda
(39:58) right and now half of it wasn't even true right it's like you're going to smoke weed and then you're going to be snorting crack right it's like uhh no
(40:05) that really wasn't are you going to drink a beer and then you're going to but the the idea for the propaganda
(40:10) though that worked was that you know a lot of people were like they had an aversion not an aversion to drug use but
(40:17) what it did was it created a culture where people who did it were considered nefarious they were considered like "You
(40:22) need to be away from me you're you're you're part of like a more nefarious crowd a bad crowd right and and you need
(40:28) to be over there." Well that's that's what reinforcement of virtue really is it's saying this idea of these
(40:34) activities are nefarious and you need to kind of keep it away from me you know it needs to be and the same thing would
(40:40) happen with the uh pushing or promotion of chastity it would be the same exact thing oh you guys are out there having a
(40:46) bunch of promiscuous sex that's as nefarious to us as your you know your massive drug abuse right that's it's the
(40:53) same exact thing and it's like you can't tell me it doesn't work because man all I've ever seen is these programs work to
(41:00) huge success just for people who take umbrage with the term propaganda there's always propaganda so if you think that
(41:06) uh the two mommies you know uh with the girl joining the army is not propaganda then you're only fooling yourself right now the propaganda has been that women
(41:12) can have it all um that you have all these choices available and they don't lead to different outcomes as far as the
(41:18) timing it's just not true so if we're going to have propaganda and you will no matter what I could also just sort of
(41:25) describe it as having an example having an ideal yeah then what's best for society well I was going to say this
(41:31) goes back to kind of the the Christianity we flipped these things and and I think they they realized that they have to go after that duty that we
(41:37) identified like having children and the Barbie movie the very beginning of it was them smashing their baby dolls and
(41:42) going into the workforce essentially and like saying "I'm going to run away from that." So it's that underpinning where it's like you don't value that anymore
(41:48) you value a career and so all of these choices that you get to make now don't worry about getting a husband don't worry about doing this all of these
(41:54) choices now lead to that the problem that I think we have is how do we convince women and look I use the same
(42:01) argument for homosexuality that is not where life is found according to scripture that is not where happiness is
(42:06) found in scripture but you don't need to convince women no I I'm just saying the opposite well I think they're finding
(42:12) out the reality of it now but pop culture still tells you go and shake what you have and get what you can go
(42:18) and be on Only Fans go and do all of these things like pop culture may take a while to catch up essentially to what
(42:23) we're seeing in culture but we got to make convince to convince women women
(42:28) are going to go so women are the most easily indoctrinated most easily propagandized out of the sexes okay
(42:35) every single study you look at will tell you this they're the most easily influenced right that's why all the
(42:41) marketing and is towards women because they buy they buy that is insane that's cuz the pink tax yeah
(42:47) exactly it's the pink tax yeah so the thing is buy a black razor yeah yeah
(42:52) well I mean the idea here uh essentially is I mean he's right right pink razors
(42:57) you charge a premium for women will buy it why because it's pink i ain't spicy it's got a glide strip but what it
(43:03) really is is Susan down the road has one okay and if Susan has it she's you know
(43:08) she's pretty awesome the other girls like what Susan's doing so I'm going to do the same thing they're the easiest when it comes to uh propaganda men much
(43:16) much harder and here's here's the what we have to deal with leftist men they
(43:22) are the ones who benefit from feminism more than anybody else the idea for
(43:27) disgusting leftist subhuman men that that they can like have sex with
(43:32) multitudes of women they love that they think it's great like this is fantastic just imagine you're a secular
(43:38) uh secular person you have no ethical code whatsoever uh you don't have any moral standing whatso and you're like
(43:44) it's an all you can eating buffet right and we'll tell them it's liberation yeah it's liberation we're liberating you i'm
(43:50) on your team honey now my Right so it's like I mean it's not it's not a joke
(43:55) though right you think a cummer gremlin like Destiny would ever in a million years if he didn't have uh you know uh
(44:02) $2 million in the bank and a bunch of YouTube fame ever any of these chicks yeah right they would literally
(44:08) scrape this off their shoe they'd walk by they wouldn't even give this guy a second glance or a third it's not
(44:17) even a matter of charisma you can't help what you're attracted to right you know what I mean you
(44:22) thinking this guy because because of how good-look he was it's like give give me a break with this right
(44:29) yeah so you think we need men need to kind of lead the way so how how do men do that because give them a mission well
(44:35) you're giving you're giving kind of these it seems like you're just observing what is you're not you're
(44:40) saying it in fact you'd probably be more on women's side than people would give you credit for like hey again to that
(44:45) argument that's not where life is found you're not going to find happiness there this is what it's supposed to be like and it makes everybody happier trust me
(44:52) don't sacrifice this gift from God to chase a career that could suck or
(44:57) anything else in life it's funny when you say you're you're you're probably more on women's side it's actually ironically hilarious do you ever see the
(45:04) movie They Live yeah with the glasses the glasses so he has the glasses he puts them on and the billboard said
(45:10) something like you know Snapple and he puts the glasses on and it says like obey right and then you know he puts the
(45:17) glasses on and he looks over here and it's like "Do what we tell you." You know what I mean this type of thing it's like unironically I want that society
(45:24) right and the re but the reason I do is because I think liberation has enslaved women that sexual liberation has
(45:31) enslaved women and it's enslaved men i want to break men out of the chains more than anything you know what I mean women
(45:36) will end up initially or initially resisting uh but convincing women has not traditionally worked let me I I I
(45:43) sort of present it sometimes this way uh to people is okay now they're always outliers you have to say not all not all
(45:49) not all okay as a general rule get rid of the alcoholic father you know who comes home and he's mad that you burnt the casserole you know and so he starts
(45:55) you locks you change you to a loom or something to make you get him a sweater without a piss break all right take those guys out of it and uh uh let's
(46:03) also take uh the awful bosses out of it you know like the boss from Dinosaur sitcom okay let's assume they're both
(46:10) within that sort of bell curve of moderately decent men all Right who do you believe has your better interest at
(46:17) heart the decent husband not perfect or even the decent
(46:22) boss because that's your choice other words if if you're going to be yolked to something yeah who if you're going to
(46:29) you are serving a master ultimately with a boss that is what that is the relationship and so even if you view it
(46:34) as serving a master right if he's the head of the household who would you rather serve the boss or the husband
(46:41) which one cares about you more because it is a binary choice yeah well like I said convincing women the reason it
(46:47) hasn't traditionally worked is because when I think of convincing I think of logic and reason if I'm going to
(46:53) convince you I'm going to use logical logical arguments and then I'm going to hope that your reason right that you use
(47:01) inductive reasoning to look at the logical argument and you backtrack it right you take it back to its original
(47:06) wherever its core was and then you move it forward and go does that make sense or not well you can do that with women and
(47:12) they'll even agree with you and then dismiss it because you have to you have to think of it from from the purview of
(47:18) their sex um they're they have raging hormones going on all the time which
(47:24) makes their brains actually erratic right uh they often will do things by
(47:29) their own admission uh that don't make any sense because they have these raging hormones going on in their
(47:35) body now every man right now who's going "Well I'm not sure about this get back
(47:40) to me after your wife's had a," you know what I mean like just stop just stop my wife has said it my sister has said it
(47:45) just for everybody out there like she said I don't know why I'm crying right now but I am i am you know what I mean like that's a common example of it so
(47:51) but here's what works what works is propaganda because if some of the sisterhood moves towards the propaganda
(47:57) cuz it's trendy right the rest of them move towards that men don't work that way so men we can convince with logic
(48:04) and reason and good arguments right and as long as they're at the top of the hierarchy in the public sector which
(48:10) they still are we can enforce this through law the idea of law enforcement though being the idea of propaganda not
(48:17) necessarily uh putting laws against specific behaviors you don't even need to do that
(48:22) stigma works better stigma actually works better if you started at a young age than even putting a law on the books
(48:27) well I remember that in high school i remember the the girls that slept around were kind of like "Ah those are the you know and and and that just was what it
(48:34) was for us." And I don't look at my generation like you know and it was so effective it was great slander yeah
(48:39) exactly you know that's how good the you slept with a guy you know as a girl like if somebody said that about you that would ruin your reputation essentially
(48:46) or would follow you around in a cutless yeah i'd be like I So I hear you like to go on dates yes yeah this is No but I
(48:54) mean I think that makes some sense because I think ultimately what we're trying to do is fix the problem that we see that is very obvious that is very
(49:00) corrosive that can destroy civilizations you talked about South Korea having you know like an extinction level birth rate
(49:07) and running that direction very quickly are several dozen other countries at least probably almost all of them except
(49:14) for a lot of African countries and South American countries birth rates are probably a little higher in those let me ask you a question let's pretend for a
(49:21) second i I don't I'm not sure you're married right yes okay let's pretend you were in the dating market your wife will
(49:26) love this okay let's let's pretend you're in the dating market for a second you meet a very fine woman you like her
(49:32) a lot she's very nice right and but she holds out on sex you know it's like your
(49:38) third date she's like you know I just don't want to rush it and she says these words cuz I really like you i really
(49:43) like you and you're like yeah okay that's great i know where this is going now you go on six more dates with her
(49:48) right uh and she's still not you know she's still like "Well I'm feeling it out cuz I really like you." And you're like "Well that makes sense." You know
(49:54) what I mean virtuous virtuous behavior i like this you found out the four guys before you though she on the first night
(50:01) can I ask you how would that make you feel that she's making you wait but let
(50:06) them have sex immediately not Not good not good not I wouldn't think I was the
(50:12) choice catch i would think like you wouldn't you be like if you really like
(50:18) me but make me wait but you didn't really like them and had sex with them
(50:24) right away then wouldn't my chances of having sex with you actually go up if you didn't like me well can I ask you
(50:30) the reason for the hypothetical is it because a lot of women who then they reach that point of settling down it's like they want to start now doing it
(50:37) that right way and the kinds of guys who would actually appreciate the genuine virtue no it's a facade it's called well
(50:43) This is covert feminism faking virtue so what's happening now is they're conforming to your idea of a virtuous
(50:49) woman well a virtuous woman's not a promiscuous woman right right they're just not that that's opposition to to
(50:56) virtue the reason she likes you so much is because you like virtuous women and she ain't one so what she's doing is
(51:04) faking virtue say "I'm going to make you wait i'm going to do this." She's trying to fit all the boxes for what you
(51:11) consider virtue to be totally faking virtue right yeah well my wife and I had this conversation because neither one of
(51:17) us waited we got married later on in life both first marriage we'd never had you know I thought he'd be single forever he did thinking when I met her
(51:23) he was like "Don't you dare screw this up she's amazing." He was so we basically said like "Look hey we've made
(51:28) some mistakes in the past we would like not to repeat that." But we did that kind of mutually i think I may have said it first or it came up in a conversation
(51:35) because immediately we're like "We both screwed up let's not do this the wrong way anymore." Sure let's give it a whirl that's a different scenario right that's
(51:41) totally fair but again but I see what you're saying if it were the case though that you were like "Oh well the last
(51:46) three guys you did you didn't really like them." And she says "Well no." And you say "Well then come over here and give me a boat job." Wouldn't that
(51:52) actually make more sense like fundamentally wouldn't it yes it does Andrew it makes more sense stop it it
(52:00) makes more sense it's like so but this is this is what you're running into
(52:05) right with the with the inconsistency uh in the idea of virtue and it's like but you know what would fix that if she
(52:12) said "I'm going to make you wait cuz I made every guy wait." Yeah because I'm still a virgin yeah and guess what
(52:18) you're going to get They would it imagine having this gold bar called virginity right he's taken over the
(52:24) local pond and throw it on in right you know what I mean into the ocean it's like you took the most valuable thing
(52:30) you have and you gave it away for free you know your biggest bargaining chip your most leveraging power right as
(52:37) opposed to the as opposed to solid gold most women know they're more like Bitcoin volatile and no one really knows
(52:42) the origin let me uh ask this did you always know uh or I should ask this were you always
(52:49) a skilled debater did you always approach it through this like for me the Socratic method was something I had to learn after high school i was never
(52:55) taught that in school or was it something you had to to sort of train yourself up in yeah my dad um my dad was
(53:01) really big on talking politics around the dinner table even when I was a kid i did so I'll give you my impression of my
(53:06) dad this is him when I was 8 years old he would be in his tidy whiteies and he would be in a chair like this and he
(53:12) would be in front of the television when Clinton would be on and it would go like this you know the problem son is these
(53:18) Democrats are skull and that  needs to be hung for treason and they're all communist and
(53:25) they need to die what's for dinner honey right and and I would just
(53:30) Oh good man and I thought it was hilarious right but I mean he would just lose his mind watching it right but what
(53:38) would happen is we were around the dinner table and he would explain he would explain his reasons for it he'd be like "Listen here's how this works and
(53:43) here's why it works that way." And so he gave me the most important thing ever which was he taught me how to think
(53:49) right so so for me logic is intuitive anyway but then you can pick it up and
(53:55) formalize it and you can like any craft you can become more skilled at it right right uh but the main thing to focus on
(54:02) is like focus on intuitive thinking because intu you know like intuitive reasoning every every man has a capacity
(54:09) for it and it's like but once you start focusing on logic itself as as being a
(54:15) format and a prism for which to focus thought y right you can basically decode
(54:20) the world the world right in front of you in in just a few minutes and when people start talking to you start
(54:25) realizing that most of the things that they say don't even make sense you're
(54:31) like dude what you're saying right now doesn't even make sense it's just it's stupid i had that moment well I had two
(54:36) moments my dad I've said given this answer many times and I'm very grateful to my father for it and I think we need more dads like him as imperfect as he
(54:42) may be got my first check doing Arthur was 11 or 12 years old and uh he
(54:47) explained to me what taxes were and asked me what I thought about the health care system and asked me if I thought that it was worth X dollars and if I
(54:54) answered I said "Well why not?" He said "Okay well what choice do you have?" and just walked me through these are how taxes work and I came home one day
(55:00) because I had a drama teacher who said we should give all of our land back to the uh Native Americans the indigenous as they said in Montreal i said "Well
(55:06) that's one of the stupidest things I've ever heard in my life." I asked her if she had heard of scalping she said "That's so right-wing." I went home to
(55:12) my dad it was a seventh grade i said "Dad what's rightwing?" He said "Who told you that who said that?" I said
(55:18) "Well my drama teacher said "Okay well let me explain it to you and you decide whether or not you are." And I walked back in the next day said "Uh yeah by
(55:24) the way I'm right-wing." try to use it as a pjorative he explained it to me um now that being said I know that you use
(55:30) logic that's the fulcrum of all of your debates but every now and then you know that it is fun to just throw down some shark bait
(55:35) uh as seen by we're going to show this really quickly as seen by this clip with this very unfortunate I'm looking at the
(55:40) wrong camera as seen by this clip with this very unfortunate looking lady um previously worked as the junk muppet
(55:46) from Labyrinth and the infamous Dunkin Donuts clip nobody's going
(55:53) to have an argument your mouth i'm going to tell you what's going to happen this is going to go seriously well this is
(55:59) going to go viral and a lot of people are going to take me seriously and all they're going to remember is that I told you that you couldn't put down the
(56:04) Dunkin Donuts long enough to make an argument now can you make one or not oh you know this is school boy by the way a
(56:11) real man doesn't speak down to a woman the way you do what you think you're not a real man you're actually very feminine
(56:17) a real man you're a very feminine man and nobody cares what you think real men are by the way I love I love the
(56:24) exposition of your smirking i went that school boy tactics cuz I just was thinking Ebony I must marry as a school
(56:30) boy yeah like nailed it so So rhetoric defined um by Socrates right is uh
(56:39) anything which is convincing mhm anything that's rhetoric so uh when
(56:46) you're debating there's two different two different ways to go about it the first is pure logic right but people
(56:54) aren't that responsive to just purely logical arguments they need to have like rhetorical flourish or also rhetoric
(57:00) which leads into the logic some way to implant it in their brains what it is that you're trying to say this is how
(57:06) people communicate by the way people communicate through rhetoric and then intuitive reasoning not usually through actual logical thinking like um like
(57:14) like stepby-step logical thinking is not how we live our lives but rhetoric is very effective so what happens is I
(57:20) always have like a match energy rule so if somebody wants to go down in the mud let's go sometimes it's remarkable so
(57:27) we've heard me talk about exactly what you say i was compared to jiu-jitsu i had a coach he said "You come at me switch I'm going to be switch you come
(57:33) at me spicy i'm going to be spicy." It's that matching intensity yeah you hit me if you you hit me low
(57:39) let's go right uh but if you want to keep it in the realm of just a pure conversation let's do that if you want
(57:45) to have purely logical debate with no at homs whatsoever and we're just going about ideas great you know what I mean
(57:51) but most people right when they begin to lose in a logical sense move immediately
(57:58) into the lowblows right and so I learned very early on well wait a second not only can I do this but I'm way
(58:04) better at it than you are right i'm way better at the lowb blows than you so if you want to go there let's do it and so
(58:10) you can make them lose twice in a sense right they lose their and then they lose on their so um you know like
(58:18) ultimately you can you can beat them beat them in two domains what happened with that woman was she would refused to make an argument oh they're going to say
(58:24) she was fat and ugly that too but she refused to make an argument just refused yeah and I was like "Look I just want
(58:30) the argument you know and so she got she got offended." For people who don't know she in that clip because we didn't show the whole thing where she was like "It
(58:36) must be terrible to be your wife wife." Yeah horri She started immediately she probably got a small pecker yeah on the
(58:41) whole on the on the whole like as many lowb blows as possible so I was like well I mean you trying to personally
(58:47) attack me is like amazingly funny you know what I mean obviously there's something I can take immediately yes
(58:54) that is very apparent to everybody and it's going to hurt you real bad and it's
(58:59) not going to do anything to me you know what I mean so bam you smack them back the other chick right same thing there
(59:05) most Can I continue this because we're we're just about at time and uh for those of you who are not Rumble Premium members click that button right there
(59:11) we're going to continue for another I don't know half hour hour here with Andrew Wilson you can watch his show The Crucible on YouTube and hold I want to
(59:18) make sure I have your ex plugged what's your ex uh Paleocoroccon okay paleocoroccon and uh if you are not a
(59:24) Rumble Premium member continue watching you will be whisked away to the land of Tim P uh which probably is uh there's
(59:32) probably less friction than you know he's more prickly Andrew Wilson and by the way I was just paraphrasing that
