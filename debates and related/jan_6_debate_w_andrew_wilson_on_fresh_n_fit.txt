Title: Jan 6 Debate w/ Andrew Wilson On Fresh N Fit
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1TK8HkDgN4

(0:00) Trump called people there on January 6th to protest the certification of the vote he led everybody to believe that that
(0:05) certification could be stopped either with Pence or with enough Force supplied I guess and as the Insurrection was
(0:11) ongoing Donald Trump was making calls to lawmakers to try to continue to
(0:16) encourage them to delay the certification of the vote there was a plan in mind the entire time it was even more extensive than that but yeah he was
(0:23) hoping that there' be a lot of pressure that's why he called people there on January 6th that's why he even when he knew they had guns and stuff he sent
(0:28) them to the capital to go and protest it's why he said over and over again stop the steel fight like hell to take our country back and it's why when
(0:34) violence started and he watched violence happening on TV and he heard that Ashley bab had been shot instead of like trying
(0:39) to call people off from being violent he tried to take advantage of the violence in order to further his scheme of having
(0:45) the vote not certified Destiny good to hear see you bro I'm glad that you're uh still here with us man so barely alive

(6:11) it thank you to the entire fresh and fit audience for coming out and to djg as well we're here today to debate if the
(6:18) events of the January 6 Capital riots were an Insurrection or if they weren't simple it's a simple debate prompt they
(6:24) either were or they weren't looking into the idea of insurrection itself it isn't exact clear what the meaning of it is it
(6:32) does always seem to be tied together with violence or some will to overthrow a government law government system
(6:37) government itself or resistance to that law or something akin to this the
(6:42) Supreme Court hasn't given us any guidance on this as they wash their hands of it and to date not a single person has been charged or convicted of
(6:49) insurrection who participated in any of the j6 rioting this includes Donald Trump himself who was acquitted of
(6:55) inciting Insurrection you would think with no clear guidance of what an Insurrection is a lack of anybody being
(7:02) prosecuted for uh this supposed Insurrection who participated and a
(7:08) president acquitted of inciting one that that would be that the events of January 6 were a protest that turned into a riot
(7:16) this is nothing new Democrats do it all the time in fact Destiny in 2021
(7:21) completely agreed with my current assessment please if you don't mind play clip one okay we will uh make that
(7:28) Available to You bills is going to roll it up right
(7:33) now and I will go ahead and give you an extra five seconds just uh on your thing
(7:39) just cuz Okay go ahead play the video please bills if you think the majority of the people there were were actually
(7:44) trying to do that and all they managed to do was like kill like one woman got shot by the cops you're [ __ ] delusional I think most of the people
(7:50) probably showed up to protest because they were [ __ ] mad and then [ __ ] got riled up they were probably almost for sure I would say some genuine Bad actors
(7:57) there that had fantasies of invading the [ __ ] [ __ ] now I think I heard from the FBI that it was like 5% or less had
(8:03) some plan to do something even that number sounds a little bit High because 5% of however many thousand people there's a lot of people but I don't
(8:08) think every single person who went there their goal was to destroy the White House or destroy the capital building and take it over because if they were we
(8:14) would have saw way more [ __ ] okay now just so you know I have no visual on my
(8:20) end when those play and I'd appreciate if you guys could put the visual up on my end as well okay in fact Destiny even
(8:26) agrees such rioting of political violence is part of the democratic process akin to voting he says he said
(8:32) this to justify the George Floyd or BLM riots that such riots were just on side of the Democrat coin and baked in to our
(8:40) Democrat process the tales in and just the other half of democracy he says of
(8:46) course he later denied this please play clip to okay and we'll get this so that
(8:51) you can uh see it one second I'm going to stop the clock while we we're we're
(8:57) right now we're 2 minutes sh oh hold on bills I'm going to start the clock once
(9:02) back up on to be fair here once the clip is up can you see it Andrew I cannot see the clip no on my end he's going to make
(9:09) it visible to you here in a second great and I stopped the clock just so everybody
(9:17) knows bear with us guys we're using a million different
(9:23) things OBS Zoom all this other stuff shout out to bills in the back working hard can you see it now I could see
(9:30) something there we go perfect so we will roll the clip now I'm going to start the clock back up bills go ahead genous sack
(9:37) of [ __ ] because as I've debated you in the past you started talking before January 6 ever occurred about how the
(9:44) BLM riots were Justified it was just the other side of the coin of voting of course once you realize that grip
(9:49) wouldn't do as well for you when you were debating the written out [ __ ] you completely 180 your position did I ever hold on did I ever say writing is the
(9:55) other side of the coin of voting probably did that's a really strange I did I that's a really go ahead okay activism and riots are one side of
(10:02) the coin and the other side is voting conspiratorial at all I think that affecting political change like this is
(10:07) fine like that's part of the goal like like activism and riots are one side of the coin and the other side is
(10:17) voting this in 20 seconds in go ahead so why why the radical change of heart on this topic from Destiny this complete
(10:24) 180 well that's simple he hates Donald Trump a simple motivation but at least
(10:30) understandable he also hates Trump's supporters in order for him to justify that he wants them all to be unived he
(10:35) needs to Brand them all as traitors and insurrectionist in this way he can build a case that Trump's supporters are evil
(10:41) and so it is Justified to use violence against them to recap that Trump supporters are evil therefore anything
(10:46) which happens to them is fine going so far as to say his friend Pisco the only
(10:52) to his friend Pisco the only reason he wouldn't have liked Trump to have been uh
(10:57) unived um by this would be assassin is because it would motivate Republicans
(11:03) this of course gives us an entailment that if it wouldn't motivate Trump supporters he would be fine with Trump
(11:08) having met his demise in this assassination attempt and this is the last clip play clip three please and
(11:14) then I'll wrap this up okay we're 4 minutes and 20 seconds in I'm going to stop the watch while we pull this
(11:21) up approxim 424 seconds but I'm adding another five from the first clip and how we were pulling it up so oh far beyond
(11:29) that so okay I'll start the clock back up once we roll the clip can you see it
(11:36) guys can you see it Andrew oh oh sorry he's he's screen sharing it right now give us one second we'll pull it up thank you audience and thank you
(11:43) thank you guys for bearing with us here many things going on we want to make sure that Andrew can see it as well as the audience yep I can see it you can
(11:48) see it okay uh bills uh go ahead I'll start the timer back up oh far beyond that so far giving a [ __ ] Beyond any of
(11:55) these [ __ ] losers but go ahead you can I ask you a question so
(12:00) and you don't have to answer if you want to yeah do you wish the attempt had been
(12:06) successful do I wish that the attempt had been successful uh am I even allowed
(12:11) to say anything about that you don't have to answer that
(12:16) here's what here's what I'll say here this is what I will say I don't I'm trying to Fed post here's what I will say a failed attempt is probably the
(12:22) worst outcome of anything that could have happened I'll say that much I disagree I think a successful attempt a
(12:28) s if that had happened M well actually hold on we might agree the accessible attempt real would be an attempt that
(12:34) point there accessible real quick so guys we just hit the pretty much the five minute Mark Destiny if you're okay
(12:39) with it I can let this kind of go on another minute or so and I'll afford you an extra minute and give you six you can
(12:45) yeah you can let thing out sure okay all right so we'll complete this out I'll time it whatever I gave Andrew I will
(12:50) give to you as well on your opening statements if you're okay with that gohe bill roll the clip back thank you Destiny uh whatever it might be the
(12:56) worst thing could happen but if it was the worst thing it would just be because of like country's reaction afterwards basically which is possible yeah I
(13:03) mean so ultimately Destiny needs to be able to provide us with what an
(13:09) Insurrection actually is an actual working legal definition or even a personal one so we can work off of that
(13:15) to understand the mindset of a person who claims this was an Insurrection even as nobody ultimately is prosecuted for
(13:22) an Insurrection he to date hasn't done this for the same reason the Supreme Court and higher courts won't if they do
(13:29) Define it strictly and categorize it strictly then it's likely Democrats and even Republicans are engaging in them
(13:35) all the time non-stop in fact I am in fact willing to in the ultimate Spirit
(13:40) of good faith concede that if Destiny just can't really Define an Insurrection or tell us what goes into that category
(13:47) and not into the category of a riot that he really has no business calling anybody an insurrectionist especially
(13:52) when nobody has been charged with an Insurrection in regards to j6 nobody and certainly not convicted I will concede
(13:59) however if he concedes Democrats are likely involved in insurrections all the time using violence for political change
(14:06) I'll concede Republicans maybe as well if his definition is that broad however that will eliminate his moral High
(14:13) Ground for the justification of do what you want to them because they're traders that would also make you a traiter with
(14:21) that I'll seed my time note in that video um that the entire audience when
(14:27) he was asked this question by peace said yes we would have preferred that Trump
(14:32) was UN alive during that assassination attempt go ahead okay um so that I have
(14:39) six approximately 6 minutes and 45 seconds there uh Destiny I will reset the clock and allot you the same exact
(14:44) amount of time to stay Fair here um let me know when you are ready and I'll restart the the clock yeah I'm ready
(14:51) whenever ready okay I'm going to start it now I'll give you 6:45 and go ahead brother all right I believe that the
(14:57) subject matter of the debate is whether or not January 6th is an Insurrection or would be considered an Insurrection um
(15:02) originally I thought there was going to be a 1 V1 debate against me and Andrew but I can do a 1v2 debate against my 2021 less educated S as well I have no
(15:09) problem speaking to arguments I've made in Prior Clips I have no problem speaking to current arguments made by Andrew uh so we can head down that road
(15:16) I think that the first thing that we need to acknowledge uh when we talk about the structure of the United States government is that the Constitution of
(15:22) the United States is the supreme law of the land the Constitution is what powers our three branches of government and it
(15:28) sits above every other part of our government and every part of our government must comport to the Constitution I think this is a
(15:34) foundational American belief uh and principle and if you don't share on this foundational belief then we're never
(15:39) going to connect in any sort of meaningful way when we talk about how US law or us process or procedure whatever
(15:45) should be carried out so that being said there was an amendment to the Constitution the 14th Amendment and
(15:51) section three of that Amendment basically goes on to say that any prior oath taker that has engaged in or aided
(15:58) in uh an interaction is no longer allowed to hold office essentially now the question that we come uh to today is
(16:04) trying to Define what is an Insurrection and while in modern times it seems like an inserection is a term left to a
(16:11) dictionary or a term left to internet Debaters at the time that the con the amendment the 14th amendment was framed
(16:16) what was an what was an Insurrection was pretty well understood uh an Insurrection includes four vital
(16:23) elements one is an assemblage meaning a group of people that have come together
(16:28) two is resisting any law or interfering with the course of a government proceeding three is you have to do this
(16:34) by way of force or intimidation and four is it has to be through a for a for a
(16:40) public concern or a public cause not a private thing that one might be interested in um just for some
(16:46) understandings of when we say an assemblage uh we can look to in 1861 uh
(16:51) justice Benjamin Curtis said a combination or conspiracy by which different individuals are united in one
(16:56) common purpose so not just a bunch of people in a city protesting different things but a group of people that are united in one common purpose um we can
(17:03) look to Justice chamu uh Samuel Chase uh in the case of freeze and the year 1800 he says if a body of people conspire and
(17:09) meditate an Insurrection to resist or oppose the execution of any statute of the United States a statute such as the
(17:16) ECA the Electoral count act which is what they were United on January 6th to insur against they were opposing the uh
(17:22) execution of that they are only guilty of a high misdemeanor but if they proceed to carry such intention into
(17:28) execution by force which we did see on the day of January 6th regardless of if every member engaged in force or just
(17:34) one uh they are guilty of the treason of levying War and the Quantum of force
(17:39) employed neither lessens nor increases the crime whether by 100 or 1,000
(17:44) persons is wholly immaterial doesn't matter if you have an Insurrection of 50 people 100 people or a thousand people you only really need two people there to
(17:51) make it an Insurrection um in terms of whether or not they were uh resisting a law or
(17:58) interfering with the cause of government um we can quote here uh an Insurrection against the United States requires
(18:04) resistance to any statute or some public law of the United States um this is a quote by uh judge um in I think 1826 uh
(18:12) Curtis uh spoke this to a jury he says the law does not distinguish between a purpose to prevent the execution of one
(18:19) or several or all laws uh an Insurrection could be directed at A legislature as well as at executive
(18:24) officials uh William R declared that an effort to coer repeal of a General law to be an over Act of levying war and um
(18:32) Justice Field's opinion in in the great house court case held that any effort to coer the conduct of government
(18:38) constituted an Insurrection such as when people went to the White House or I'm sorry went to the capital to coers Pence
(18:44) to overthrow the election which is what Donald Trump told them to do uh by force or by intimidation uh quoting Justice
(18:50) Marshall in 1807 the most comprehensive definition of living war against the king or against the United States which I have seen requires an assemblage of
(18:57) men ready to act and with an intent to do some treasonable act and armed in warlike manner or else assembled in such
(19:02) numbers as to supersede the necessity of arms you don't necessarily need weapons to do it you could just have the the
(19:08) numbers of people there threatening to use force or intimidation um and then for a public purpose obviously um the
(19:14) Insurrection is to I'm quoting judge uh John C here insurrections to redress by force National grievances or to form
(19:20) real or imaginary evils of a public nature uh obviously they were uh protesting the vote that's what they
(19:26) were there to do uh this is obviously a public issue so to recount for the assembly there were hundreds of people
(19:32) that breached the capital building there were thousands that trespassed on Federal Land for two there was a clear resistance to the federal law the
(19:38) trespassers were there to cont the Electoral count act there was a plethora of evidence brought up in the Anderson versus grizwald case about this uh where
(19:45) quoting the justices uh quoting the judges on that case they said substantial evidence in the record showed that the mob's unified purpose
(19:50) was to hinder or prevent Congress from counting the electoral votes as required by the 12th Amendment and from certifying the 2020 presidential
(19:57) election the third element the resistance made extensive use of force this is self-evident just by watching
(20:02) any of the videos to quote the Colorado Supreme Court again the mob repeatedly and violently assault the police officers who were trying to defend the
(20:08) capital uh obviously there were calls to hang Mike Pence and people marched very famously with 1776 signs which as many
(20:14) in this audience might be familiar with was a very popular Insurrection in US history uh or a rebellion even one might
(20:20) say and then for a public purpose it was obviously for the public purpose of resisting the what they perceived to be
(20:25) as the stealing of the election um there are ways to try to counter this argument we can either use nonsense definitions
(20:31) of insurrection but that doesn't really matter the only thing that matters was the public understanding and the legal understanding of insurrection at the
(20:36) time the 14th amendment was created and when Section 3 was framed because that's what the Constitution demands that we
(20:42) look at what was thought of as an Insurrection when the language was added to the Constitution uh we can try to
(20:47) divert by talking about BLM or anything else and I'm happy to dive into all of those examples if we are going to concede on the original argument that
(20:54) January 6 satisfies all four elements of what I consider an Insurrection to be um if we want to concede that and move on
(20:59) to analyzing any particular BLM action or whatever that's totally fine uh we can talk about the likeliness to work of
(21:05) which an Insurrection has never been defined as an Insurrection doesn't necessarily have to lead to the overthrow of a government that would be
(21:10) understood as a rebellion uh every Insurrection is not a rebellion though every Rebellion starts as an Insurrection and then when we say this
(21:16) is a common one as well why was no one charged with an Insurrection uh people can be charged or couldn't be charged with crimes for a variety of reasons but
(21:23) for purposes of the 14th Amendment nothing in there requires the criminal conviction of the crie of insurrection
(21:29) only that an Insurrection occurred and that one engaged in it or aided it all right uh and that is 640 okay so uh just
(21:37) 5 Seconds shy that completes the opening statements uh really good arguments from both sides here uh we'll go into round
(21:44) one I'll turn it back so we just completed opening statements guys each party had six minutes and 45 seconds to
(21:51) make their original stance and um their first uh opening statements we'll go to round one I'll set the clock for 3
(21:57) minutes Andrew let let me know when you are ready and yeah I'm ready okay timer is going now go ahead three yeah so
(22:03) let's start with this idea of my definition what the hell do I care about your definition nobody has been
(22:09) prosecuted for any Insurrection by any definition Destiny comes through and he
(22:16) gives us this list he says one an assemblage okay two resisting any law or
(22:22) interfering with the course of a government proceeding okay three by force or intimidation okay four for a
(22:27) public purpose he has just outlined basically almost every single political Riot I've ever
(22:34) heard of that is what that is outlining so let's see an assemblage this would cover a riot bunch of people assembling
(22:41) resisting any law or interfering with the course of a government proceeding uh that could be shutting down roadways for
(22:47) Commerce that could mean anything by force or intimidating if you have black lives matter other groups like this who
(22:53) are out there saying no justice no peace that would be very intimidating and then for public purpose very nebulous all of
(23:01) this is completely nebulous language he has not actually given us a definition
(23:07) at all uh by the way if you could cam me while I'm talking I'd appreciate it um he has not given us a definition at all
(23:15) he's he's just kind of given us this this loose nebulous um you know
(23:20) framework for what is or isn't a uh an Insurrection so let's kind of dive into
(23:27) a couple more things here he says people can or can't be charged for a variety of reasons he that's not saying anything so
(23:33) what yeah that's true maybe they committed Insurrection and they weren't charged for Insurrection but also maybe
(23:40) they did not commit Insurrection and that's why they weren't charged with Insurrection that's a
(23:46) non-argument he says that these elements third element self-evident Colorado Supreme Court using 1776 signs people
(23:53) use 1776 signs all the time and have absolutely no interest in any any type
(23:58) of rebellion whatsoever it's very common for people to have those as bumper stickers that doesn't mean that they're
(24:04) going to be engaging in any kind of rebellion or Insurrection at all he also
(24:09) as he uh talks about these various uh rulings he says treason of levying War
(24:14) comes in obviously Insurrection seems to have something to do with levying war against the United States or at least
(24:21) some type of start to Levy war against the United States he still has not actually demonstrated any of this he's
(24:27) just given us the really nebulous idea an assemblage resisting any law or interfering with a course of government
(24:33) proceeding by force or intimidating for public this is very nebulous so unless Destiny is going to concede that
(24:40) anything which meets his criteria is an Insurrection uh then I'm I'm not even sure how to go forward with this debate
(24:47) how in the world can he say essentially almost any Riot on planet Earth uh or
(24:52) any assemblage even a peaceful protest where they shut down the roads is an Insurrection that can't be true that
(24:57) just can't be true okay um we had ended there at about 257 Andrew you're up on
(25:04) on our Channel they can see you I don't know if it's yeah we're good on mine too you are okay perfect I just want to make sure there we're there so but you are
(25:10) definitely up on and um whoever speaking I always make them the main person so D I'm going to put uh this is round one
(25:16) I'm going to put three minutes on the clock for you are you ready yeah all right go ahead brother so I think my
(25:21) definition is pretty clear there's an assemblage there's a clear resistance to the implementation or the execution of some federal law um the resistance has
(25:28) an aim to make use of force or intimidation and it's gathered for a particular public purpose uh BLM almost
(25:35) automatically fails on the fact that these were not usually demonstrations against federal law I don't know the
(25:41) federal law or the federal thing that was being resisted by BLM um but again I'm happy to dive into any particular
(25:47) BLM supposed Insurrection or Riot uh if you'd like but again I mean that has not to do with January 6 and if you want
(25:53) then you can see that entire argument we can move on to analyzing individual BLM instances but again you'd have to show that there was implementation or
(25:59) carrying out of some federal function for it to be an Insurrection against the United States government States might
(26:04) have their own definitions of State insurrections I'm unaware of any um so to uh say again uh my definition of
(26:10) insurrection like very clearly has four elements uh if you want to suggest an alternate definition that you feel more
(26:17) accurately comports with what you would consider an interr to be that's fine but we can't just say that it's nebulous and
(26:23) there is no definition when we have um we've got references made in our constit
(26:28) ution and in our uh Federal criminal code to Insurrection that doesn't make any sense um we can complain about
(26:33) people being charged with an Insurrection or not um but whether or not somebody's charged with an
(26:39) Insurrection again has nothing to do with the event itself um for instance if I were to look and see at any number of
(26:44) BLM uh riots if I were to look at a riot would a challenge to that Riot be well was anybody charged with rioting if I
(26:51) could show you a riot where people clearly engaged in a riot where there was a mass of people that were engaged in violent behavior that involved the
(26:56) destruction of some property or violent activity but I would say well look nobody was actually charged with rioting would you say then that well I guess
(27:02) nobody was actually or there wasn't a riot that actually happened nobody would make that uh claim there's a whole list
(27:07) of reasons why a prosecutor may or may not charge for particular crimes uh in this particular case there were really
(27:13) good reasons not to head down that Insurrection charge road because it would probably put the Supreme Court in a very hairy area which they might end
(27:19) up getting into anyway in terms of actually having a strict definition of what an Insurrection is um but again the 14th Amendment doesn't require a strict
(27:26) definition of insurrection in order to bar somebody from running from Office uh all it needs is for a court to engage
(27:31) and asking the question of whether or not somebody had engaged in an Insurrection and if they had and were prior oath taker then they were barred
(27:36) uh from taking any uh public office in the future uh so yeah again if if there's an alternate definition that
(27:42) wants to be explored for an Insurrection then I welcome that but that definition needs to have it needs to comport with
(27:48) the historical and legal understanding of what an Insurrection was otherwise it's just meaningless Meandering um yeah
(27:54) opining that means nothing when we should be thinking like what was the definition of Direction at the time the 14th amendment was
(28:00) drafted okay uh that's 2 minutes and 40 seconds uh you don't want to use the rest of the 20 seconds Destiny Okay um
(28:07) yeah I well I mean like there we can if this ends up going into like a whole bunch of like BLM stuff I mean we can
(28:12) get to that but that has no bearing on whether j6 would be considered an Insurrection or not so okay uh so 2
(28:18) minutes 57 seconds uh that completes round one um I will restart the clock we'll move into round two I'll turn it
(28:25) back to you Andrew uh let me know when you're ready and I'll turn the clock on so I'm not claiming that this has
(28:31) anything to do with BLM I'm doing an internal critique and saying that if you're going to apply these nebulous standards to this then you must apply
(28:38) them to this if this category of category a over here also would include
(28:43) everything which includes a riot then we would need to know what the delineating factor is he he claims here you must
(28:50) there must be some federal element however that's not in his definition his definition does not include any federal
(28:56) element to go over his definition in an assemblage resisting law by force or intimidation for public purpose it
(29:02) doesn't say anything about a federal element he just pulled that out of his ass I don't know where the hell he got that for it's definitely not in his definition if it was he should have said
(29:09) that that was in his definition he said he keeps going back to this illogical idea that just because X doesn't happen
(29:15) it doesn't mean X isn't true yeah that's true but it also doesn't mean X is true so making the claim that well wait a
(29:22) second Andrew just because they weren't actually charged with Insurrection doesn't mean they weren't guilty of
(29:27) insurrection well that's nice but it doesn't mean they were either and I have the evidence on my side as none of them
(29:33) were actually prosecuted for Insurrection none of them were prosecuted for Insurrection and Trump
(29:39) was acquitted for inciting Insurrection so the evidence is on my side he would
(29:45) actually have to demonstrate that this was an Insurrection and that they were all wrong that they were completely
(29:51) incorrect In not charging it this way he just keeps saying well there's a variety of reasons why they didn't well that's
(29:57) nice couldn't one of the reasons be because it wasn't an Insurrection yes that seems to be a very obvious reason
(30:03) doesn't it um going back to my opening I just want to kind of point out that
(30:09) Destiny has changed his entire idea on this whereas at first he claimed in 2021
(30:16) this was in no way an Insurrection that it fit the criteria of a riot better from anybody who's looking at it
(30:22) objectively I agree with him that's exactly what it fits but he still has
(30:27) not demonstrated at all that this was actually an Insurrection he just says well I have this nebulous definition he
(30:34) also says give me a counter definition it's not my burden to give you a counter def what do you mean I'm not calling him
(30:40) insurrectionist you're calling him insurrectionist I don't have to Define for you what that means you have to
(30:45) Define for me what that means giving me these four uh elements here is meaningless unless you can tell me what
(30:52) goes in those categories specifically that does not go in the category for rioting because as I look at an
(30:59) assemblance resisting any law by force or intimidating or for public that could all just be rioting that does not really
(31:05) tell me what goes in the category you didn't include Federal anything so I would like for you to actually expand on
(31:11) this definition so I can understand what the hell you're talking about and why the J Sixers specifically fit this
(31:16) criteria all right um that is 2 minutes and 49 seconds uh Destiny I'll turn it
(31:22) to you um whenever you're ready and we are in round two right now the bottom of
(31:27) round yeah so people like again so there's two parts to the uh Insurrection uh two
(31:34) elements that I don't think would fit so the first one is an assemblage that would clearly fit a riot I think but um
(31:40) it would fit a riot and it would fit in Insurrection um the second part is resisting a particular law or
(31:46) interfering with the course of a government proceeding there are plenty of riots that aren't riots to resist
(31:51) like the implementation of a law or to interfere necessarily with like some government proceeding we can imagine a
(31:56) million reasons why people might Riot outside of a baseball game people might Riot um in protest to a statement that
(32:03) was made or in in relation to um I don't know the outcome of a sporting EV like there's tons of people that can Riot
(32:09) that aren't rioting with the goal of resisting the implementation of a particular law or trying to interfere with the course of some uh government
(32:16) proceeding so the part two the second element I've listed really wouldn't comport with with most riots um and then
(32:22) the third one is uh the third element by force or intimidation um I would say that
(32:28) generally have a forceful or intimidating aspect to them although they generally happen spontaneously
(32:34) usually they're not planned in advance to use like force or intimidation um so
(32:40) uh to quote uh justice Greer uh quote legal authorities carefully distinguished planned insurrections from
(32:45) spontaneous riots uh just Robert Justice Robert Greer charged the grand jury in the United States of beanway that a
(32:51) defendant who was not leagued with violent resistors to federal law could not be prosecuted for treason Greer
(32:56) insisted that spontaneous RS were not insurrections that insurrections required a commitment to use Force to
(33:01) resist law not spur of the moment violence most riots just kind of like happen uh it's pretty rare that they are
(33:08) planned in advance and I think we all agree that if they are planned in advance it takes on a much different character and arguably uh could call
(33:14) under it like different types of crimes if people are you know engage in rioting is not good but if people are literally planning it out in advance we are
(33:20) calling in a whole bunch of different crimes there than just the simple thing of calling a particular thing a riot and then for the fourth thing when we say
(33:25) for a public purpose the fourth element this is the second thing that I don't think most riots would necessarily be in
(33:31) opposition to that we are
(33:51) Insurrection against like a a federal entity again if we want to talk about like State insurrections or something I I guess we can but the differentiating
(33:57) factor the reason why I have the federal part is because we're talking about Federal insurrections and especially for the 14th Amendment the federal
(34:02) Insurrection part is what we're kind of talking about I'm not even sure if you can do a state interaction maybe you can um but I mean like summarizing this
(34:08) argument like the Colorado Court found that Donald Trump acted as part of an assemblage okay that he helped bring it a he called the people there uh Trump
(34:15) was resisting the enforcement of federal and constitutional rules he was contributing the 12th Amendment and he was resisting the Electoral count act um
(34:22) Donald Trump he took numerous legal actions to prevent the peaceful transition of Presidential Power this is like a function of the government uh he
(34:28) engaged in ongoing an ongoing course of conduct and producing violent resistance to people transfer Presidential Power and he was attempting cour Congress yeah
(34:35) whether somebody start doesn't matter okay that is time uh so what I'll do is
(34:41) um that that concludes round two um Andrew uh I'll turn it back to you
(34:47) unless you want me to give Destiny a little bit extra time and I can give you that extra time as well on the back end
(34:52) but I'll let you choose that yeah I'm fine he can finish okay um destiny go ahead and finish and yeah my sure the
(34:58) final point was that um yeah but the my final statement is okay if you looked at the Colorado court case they found that
(35:03) Donald Trump acted as part of an assembl that he'll bring into being it said that uh Trump was resisting the enforcement
(35:09) of federal and constitutional rules that Trump took numerous illegal actions to prevent the peaceful transition Presidential Power he engaged in an
(35:16) ongoing course of conduct aimed at producing violent resistance to the peaceful transfer Presidential Power um
(35:21) he attempted to incite a supporters to attack Congress which they did and that Trump's speech occurred sufficiently close in time and place to when and
(35:27) where the Insurrection took place to be considered an excitement like every single part of this like very easily and very cleanly meets the definition of
(35:33) insurrection if we want to argue that my definition isn't clean or that my four elements aren't being met that's well I don't know how we can argue that I think
(35:39) all four elements are being met if we want to argue that well every single Riot would uh you know fall into this then we could say well fine Destiny I
(35:45) agree for your definition of insurrection fine January 6 was an Insurrection now let's talk about these other events and we could talk about
(35:50) whether they fit or don't fit or you can give me your own definition of insurrection and then we can go from there okay that added an extra 55
(35:56) seconds so and we'll go into round three Andrew I will give you that so you will have 3 minutes and 55 seconds to uh yeah
(36:05) your time so uh I'll start at the clock now yeah so again uh trying to put the burden on me to give you a definition of
(36:11) your claim is insane uh as we went through your definition here uh it's
(36:16) really funny because I'm going to use your own logic back to you just because
(36:22) they weren't charged with an Insurrection doesn't mean it wasn't an Insurrection oh okay well they were
(36:27) actually charged with elements of rioting so I'm going to say it was actually rioting and I'm also going to
(36:33) say that wait a second your definition here seems to be more about rioting than anything else by your own claim an
(36:41) assemblage would fit a riot says Destiny that's his first claim resisting any law or interfering with the course of a
(36:46) government proceeding it wouldn't fit rioting itself says Destiny even though rioting itself is against the law what
(36:52) do you mean of course it's impeding the law well how could it not be impeding the law rioting itself is against the
(36:59) law I don't know where the hell you came up with that by force or intimidation Destiny concedes riots require Force for
(37:06) a public purpose he concedes that's a riot so really under his definition this is just a riot and the only thing that
(37:12) we're arguing about here is number two resisting any law or interfering with the course of a government proceeding
(37:18) let's try this again resisting any law or interfering with the course of a
(37:23) government proceeding a riot itself is uh resisting the law because it's
(37:30) illegal to Riot so I don't understand how that again would not just be a riot
(37:36) all of these things seem to fall under the category of what people were charged with which is much more along and Akin
(37:42) to rioting than it is any type of insurrection he still hasn't told us the distinction that fits in this category
(37:48) why this isn't a riot even though everybody was charged under that kind of branch of rioting and not charged for
(37:54) Insurrection this is a garbage definition it's totally nebulous right
(37:59) and he keeps on saying well wait a second Andrew why don't you go ahead and concede that unless you can go against
(38:05) all four of these points why I don't actually have to do that all I need to do is say okay all these four points fit
(38:11) a different criteria better than Insurrection and apparently he agrees he
(38:16) agrees on 0.1 3 and point 4 the only thing he argues is0 2 but his argument for 0 2 makes no sense because writing
(38:23) itself is illegal so therefore you are resisting any law or interfering with the course of a government proceeding
(38:29) well the government proceeding is to enforce law you would be interfering with the government enforcing law if you're rioting so all of these fall
(38:36) under the better criteria of Riot which is it totally consistent in my mind because that was the criteria in which
(38:43) people were charged not with Insurrection and I really need Destiny to answer to that okay uh that was 2
(38:50) minutes and 40 seconds you still have a minute left Andrew you're GNA con that round then yeah I'll let him I'll let him go ahead and answer to it cool so
(38:56) I'm gonna so um I will turn it back to you Destiny we're in round uh three and uh this is
(39:02) the second part of round three so your turn Destiny start the clock back up for you breaking a law and resisting law are
(39:09) not the same thing usually when people Riot they're not rioting with the purpose of making arson or murder or um
(39:18) or or whatever other crimes are being broken to make those legal things usually they're breaking laws not with
(39:23) the intent of like resisting the implementation or the execution of those laws or resisting or uh contenting the
(39:29) execution of like some function of government um when people were rioting on January 6th the goal of that was to
(39:36) stop the execution of the Electoral count act it was to stop the purpose of the government the execution the
(39:42) function of government to do the peaceful transfer of power they weren't simply engaged in violence and breaking the law they were resisting the carrying
(39:48) out of the law the Electoral uh the Electoral count act the EA um and and I
(39:53) don't know we we can loop on this over and over again but again if I can show you you in Kenosha if I can show you in
(40:00) Seattle if I can show you a riot if I can give you a video of cities burning of people screaming and throwing [ __ ] of
(40:07) you know property being destroyed or damaged and then you would have go wow that kind of looks like a riot to me I would go yeah it kind of does however
(40:13) nobody was actually charged with the crime of writing so do you change your mind on that probably wouldn't affect your opinion at all um again whether or
(40:19) not you Levy a particular charer a person is way different than whether or not a particular event was a thing
(40:25) remember a when you Levy a a charge at somebody a criminal charge what you're really saying is that you can take a
(40:31) person an individual and prove Beyond a reasonable doubt that no reasonable mind would um would agree that something else
(40:36) could have happened in front of a jury that's what Criminal Court is for proving that somebody engaged in a crime
(40:41) Beyond A Reasonable Doubt in a criminal court is not the standard that we use to declare a particular thing a thing you
(40:47) don't have to prove in Criminal Court Beyond a reasonable doubt that a thing was an Insurrection or that a thing was a riot unless we were charging somebody
(40:54) with an actual crime okay uh there's uh that's 150 on the clock so um that concludes round
(41:01) three and I'm going to turn it to you gentlemen you guys can let me know what you want we can either do another round
(41:07) of three minutes uninterrupted debating if you guys want to formulate arguments a bit more because I know there is some I I would like to do one more round if
(41:13) we could or destiny are you okay with that sure okay and then after that so we'll go into a fourth round with a
(41:20) three minute uh debate time limit where no interruptions then after that we can get into the 5 minutes of discourse
(41:27) between you to where you can actually speak but is that fair for everybody sure sure cool all right so I will go ahead and reset the clock uh this will
(41:34) be round four uh take it away Andrew yeah so this is uh this is an absurd argument we'll go right back to
(41:39) Destiny's logic again he says just because uh you know somebody was in charged with X doesn't mean X didn't
(41:45) happen uh this is the same this is complete and total off fisc by the way because ultimately what's going on here
(41:52) is that these do fit the criteria much better for a riot and under the purview of rioting these are are the the types
(41:58) of charges which were levied at these people Destiny says specifically under point two he said and he didn't answer
(42:04) to this he said relist resisting any law or interfering with the course of a government proceeding wouldn't fit
(42:10) rioting yes it does fit rioting it fits rioting better than anything else I can think of yes you are
(42:16) immediately upon rioting resisting the law and you are obstructing the law
(42:22) immediately that is what a riot is it's an unlawful assembly so how he could say
(42:28) this in fact each point he concedes on point one an assemblage that would fit a riot an assemblage would fit a riot
(42:35) that's point one he agrees okay point three by force or intimidation uh intimidation he agrees on point three
(42:42) that that is a riot he agrees on point four he conceded on that as well and
(42:49) then he just conceded on point two he couldn't exactly tell us why resisting any law or interfering with the course
(42:55) of a government proceeding wouldn't fit a right of course it fits a riot all of these in fact fit the events of January
(43:01) 6th perfectly perfectly and if he's conceding that hey these fit a riot
(43:08) perfectly the events of January 6th were a riot under this definition which he
(43:14) ESS essentially has conceded is true then the charges were appropriate that this was a riot and not an Insurrection
(43:22) this could not have been an Insurrection the his own definition proves that this is morein to a riot he still hasn't
(43:29) really told us by the way what an Insurrection is just these kind of four nebulous points but these four nebulous
(43:35) points fit a riot perfectly perfectly and he's basically conceded to three of
(43:41) them on the outset and then on the second he's basically conceded that as well because resisting any law or
(43:46) interfering with a course of a government proceeding would fit a riot by its very nature the reason it would fit a riot by its very nature is because
(43:53) it's immediately an unlawful assembly you're resisting the law you're resisting the police resisting resisting resisting so whether that's done at a
(44:00) federal level or a state level I think it would still fate uh uh meet the same fate of being morein to a riot this
(44:07) definition really moves towards a riot and not towards an Insurrection he has
(44:12) not told us the distinction yet and so again I think that the entire reason he wants this only painted as an
(44:18) Insurrection even though nobody's ever been charged with an Insurrection even though Trump was cleared of inciting an Insurrection is so that he can make
(44:24) justifications for why the other side Des deserves what it gets cuz there are a bunch of Traders thus far no I'm sorry
(44:31) this uh this definition nor this logic adds up the logic of saying well just because it they weren't charged with a
(44:37) thing doesn't mean it wasn't the thing fine but that doesn't mean it was the thing either and by your criteria seems
(44:43) like it was this other thing okay that's 3 minutes and 10 seconds uh I will make
(44:48) the clock the same for you Destiny so keep it fair uh I will start the timer if you're ready
(44:55) now yeah I don't I I guess we're just going to loop on these points um resisting a law is not the same thing as
(45:00) breaking a law if you could show me that there was a particular Riot where people assembled and the goal of that Riot was
(45:07) when they were rioting they wanted to Riot to make rioting legal um and that they had gathered you know in order to
(45:13) change the law in a particular area and they were going to use force and intimidation to do it we we're here to Riot today because we're going to make rioting legal then sure then we could
(45:20) argue that that's probably an Insurrection um but I mean these are the four elements that were historically understood at the time nobody had any
(45:26) issues at the time charging people with crimes of insurrection nobody had any confusion at the time historically um
(45:31) there was Shay's rebellions the whiskey Insurrection the bur Insurrection John Brown's raids um you had convictions of
(45:37) um you know like a Pennsylvania farmer uh I think set fire to a house of a tax collector in 1794 he was charged with
(45:43) Insurrection um John FZ and Friends made a show of arms that resulted in the releas of persons charged with federal tax evasion that was considered an
(45:49) Insurrection uh in 1847 when Hispanic Native Americans attacked occupying American officials in New Mexico that was considered an Insurrection in 1851
(45:57) when Pennsylvania obstructed official efforts to capture an alleged F fugitive slave that was an Insurrection in 1856
(46:03) um when there were uh rival forces in the United States that were violently resisting the laws on slavery that was
(46:09) considered Insurrection um these aren't just like riots where people are like we're mad and were breaking the law by
(46:14) being violent it was they were resisting the law they were resisting an actual like federal law claiming that that
(46:20) particular law shouldn't exist they were trying to air a public grievance through force or intimidation with an assembled group of people in the in the in the
(46:27) goal of like overturning that particular thing through violent action um and then on this final thing so there is a
(46:32) difference between resisting law and breaking a law just because you're engaged in a riot doesn't mean that you're resisting the implementation of
(46:38) law people that are engaged in riots aren't usually rioting to make riots legal that's what would make that the equivalent and then just the crime of X
(46:43) is not the same thing as the event of X I don't know why we keep saying this nobody was charged with Insurrection therefore there was no Insurrection if I walk into a room and I see a person's
(46:50) throat cut can I not say that there was a murder here if nobody was charged with murder if I see 20 people setting fire to a house and they all run away and
(46:56) nobody gets charged with arson can I not say that an arson happened if I look on video and I see that there's 500 people blowing up you know some [ __ ] and they
(47:02) managed to run away or the cops you know can't arrest any these people charge them with like the formal I guess crime of writing does that mean there was no
(47:07) right that took place the crime of X is different than the event of X and right now we're talking about if January 6 was
(47:13) an Insurrection not did any individual person engage in the criminal behavior of insurrection that would be a separate
(47:18) conversation if we want to have that conversation we could but we would have to first conceive that an Insurrection did indeed take place on January 6th and I believe that the Colorado Supreme
(47:24) Court engaged in good analysis and they decided that an Insurrection had taken place because it comports with all four elements that I gave to an Insurrection
(47:30) that were commonly understood in the historical and legal record around the time that the uh 14th amendment was passed when they were putting
(47:36) Insurrection in the section three of the 14th Amendment to prevent prior oakers from holding office again who had engaged
(47:42) Insurrection okay uh so that completes round four of the three minute uninterrupted uh rounds uh if you guys
(47:49) are okay with it we will move on to the F minute round where you guys are able to actually have Open disc well I have a
(47:56) quick I have a quick counter if Destiny wants to agree to this uh for the purpose of uh of fairness um I'm willing
(48:02) to do I'm willing to do two rounds of internal critiques and I'll allow Destiny to start with an internal
(48:08) critique if I can move to an internal critique after so two five minute rounds of internal critiques does that sound
(48:13) fair what do we mean when we say internal critique what does that mean it means that I'm just here to answer your questions for five minutes and you're
(48:19) here to answer mine um sure okay I'll let you go first okay so uh
(48:27) okay just so I make sure I have this right so I can moderate it properly is he going to question you Andrew and
(48:33) you're GNA yeah he gets round one five minutes and then I get round two five minutes okay so basically okay so it's
(48:38) essentially a Q&A between the two of you where okay so or destiny if you're okay with that we can do that or we can go to
(48:45) just open discourse between the two of you where you I think I I feel like I probably because I feel like um part of
(48:51) my argument is going to be that he hasn't put forth like a positive position yet for me to even attack or interrogate so I'm not even sure what I
(48:56) would do on the Inquisition round so I feel like it' be better to just do back and forth okay well if you want to do
(49:03) back and forth I'm prepared for that too okay but you guys are good with no more you don't need any more three minute rounds to uh solidify your stance no
(49:10) okay so I will go ahead and um set the timer here for five minutes uh I will I
(49:16) guess who wants to kick it off uh I can kick it off uh real quick so Destiny would you agree with me that uh the
(49:24) motivation for demonizing the opp opposition political party often revolves around calling them traitors uh
(49:30) accusing them of treason and pushing for um you know some type of villainization
(49:35) that they are against the country they are against you they are against everybody uh for another debate maybe
(49:41) but that's not at all any of the subject here any of the subject matter here well I think it is I think it ties in because I believe that the motivation for why
(49:47) you're claiming that the other side are a bunch of insurrectionist though you have no direct evidence of this and your
(49:53) own criteria is just that of basically a riot that your motivation is just to demonize the opposition sure but this
(50:00) isn't a debate over my motivation I could be motivated by a 100 million different bad faith factors and literally none of them would be relevant
(50:05) to this conversation it could be the fact that the DNC actually paid me money to give this precise argument and KL is on the phone with me right now and it
(50:11) wouldn't it wouldn't have any impact on this particular debate I think it would be I think the motivation for why you're
(50:17) making the argument itself would have an impact on the debate but I am willing to concede that if you just want to keep it
(50:23) to the material we can let's move over to point two then point two you say
(50:28) resisting any law or interference with the course of a government proceeding wouldn't fit rioting itself how does
(50:34) that not fit rioting itself of course it does well let's say for instance the purpose of a riot was because you felt
(50:40) like the law wasn't being enforced it wouldn't make sense to call that part of an Insurrection let's say for instance that there was a age let's say that
(50:47) there was a lynching of a person and you felt like the cops weren't you know upholding their Duty or whatever and so you decide to have a a protest that
(50:52) turns into a riot and you all show up with the goal of protesting and rioting because you felt like the law wasn't being carried out here you wouldn't really call that an Insurrection because
(50:58) they're not trying to contravene a legal process um just because again you engage in unlawful conduct doesn't mean that
(51:04) you're trying to resist like the implementation of the carrying out resisting the laws that would be the same case with Insurrection then no
(51:11) because TR require intent yes yeah correct yes so the intent would be the
(51:17) contravening of the Electoral count act when people say we need to March and make our voices heard on January 6th to
(51:22) the capital grounds where people are going to protest they're protesting the execution of the electoral count act
(51:27) which demanded that vice president Pence count the electoral votes Donald Trump didn't want that he made it very clear in the days preceding him Bannon Eastman
(51:34) ches bro and everybody else that was working alongside him um Sydney pal everybody else was saying that we need to prevent pence from counting the
(51:39) electoral vote that was the execution of a lawful government function that's people going there protes but even if
(51:45) all that's true destiny it wouldn't it still wouldn't matter because the events of January 6 themselves the intent of
(51:50) the people could have just been to Riot not indeed to commit to any sort of treasonous in Insurrection activity and
(51:57) you have failed to demonstrate this time and time again how this actually would meet the criteria of an Insurrection
(52:04) them showing up and just like you're take in 2021 right when you say hey look
(52:09) the damage would have been way worse way worse if they had shown up with the purposes of actual Insurrection or some
(52:16) type of uh 1776 mindset this is the most armed Nation on the planet Earth how in
(52:21) the world can you say these people showed up specifically in order to do that that makes no sense man none of
(52:26) this law uh none of that argumentation we secretary people very quick they obviously showed up to protest the uh
(52:32) certification of the vote they were called there by Donald Trump non Secor then you in 2021 were using a non Secor
(52:38) when you made the argument that from the appearance of this it could not have been an Insurrection 2021 Destiny was
(52:44) incorrect because 2021 Destiny didn't have the historical context to understand an Insurrection if you want to bring him on here and talk to him you
(52:50) can but I don't agree with everything that I said not I am 2024 Destiny I have learned more things I have done more
(52:55) studying I have read more and I've done more research on this there is actually a strong understanding of what an
(53:00) Insurrection is and there was a strong historical understanding of what an Insurrection is and the idea that a bunch of people were called on January 6
(53:06) the date wasn't a mistake when Donald Trump sent them down there to protest when he said we need Mike Pence to do the right thing what was he talking
(53:11) about he wanted him to contravene the law and that's what people marched down there for them to do Donald Trump Donald
(53:17) Trump said 30 minutes before this began that this needed to remain a peaceful protest he never said that he did I
(53:23) actually have the tweet I have the tweet did he did say that in the speech he
(53:28) said to fight like hell and in the speech he said that we need to go down I'm talking about his tweets why would
(53:34) why would a person put out a tweet to be peaceful if their intent was Insurrection Destiny why would a person
(53:41) call a protest on January 6th what do you think they were protesting what do you mean they they call protest people
(53:46) call protest all the time that doesn't mean we're not talking about other protest I'm asking what was the purpose
(53:51) of the protest on January 6 the purpose of the protest was to go out and show support for Donald Trump for what well
(53:58) there there was a variety of reasons I think wait wait are you telling me we can't understand what the January
(54:03) protest was about no no no are you saying there wasn't a variety of reasons why people didn't show up NOP I think there was one clear reason oh there was
(54:10) only one reason why everybody showed up correct 10 seconds okay what is the one
(54:15) clear reason there was not a variety of reasons some people didn't show up just because they wanted to see what was happening some people didn't show up
(54:21) just to support the president some people didn't show up because they really like to go to protest everybody showed up for one reason I didn't say
(54:27) everybody showed up for one reason I said they were called there for one reason and that was to protest the certification of the election guys guys
(54:33) guys that is time um I'm happy to let this play out longer if you guys want uh
(54:38) and add an extra minute to the clock uh are you guys okay with that yeah we can add an extra minute I'm fine with that
(54:44) and we this is still round one of the open discourse uh but just try to limit it to one minute and then we'll go into
(54:50) round two of it uh and then uh and we can go from there and if we need more rounds at the F minute Mark we can now
(54:56) that so yeah I so I have a problem with him ascribing motivation to all he says there's one clear reason why everybody
(55:02) showed up that's clearly not true that doesn't even logically make sense he could never demonstrate in a million
(55:07) years that there was only one clear reason why everybody showed up that's a nonsensical argument Destiny that's not
(55:13) the argument that I'm making if the if the debate was if the the debate is whether or not January 6th is an
(55:18) Insurrection not did every single person on January 6th engage in the crime of insurrection or did every single person
(55:24) on January 6th go with the intent to commit why did you say there was one clear reason said there was a clear reason why people were called there
(55:30) because there was Donald Trump called people there to protest not on January 5th and not on January 7th and not in a
(55:35) random part of DC and not in a random part of the country he called them on January 6th to uh to the uh to the
(55:41) ellipses that was less than a mile walk away from the capital building which is where he sent every single person after his speech he called them there on the
(55:47) day of the certification of the votes after spending days trying to pressure Pence to overturn the election he told
(55:53) them that they need to go on protest for the lawful of electors to be counted the illegitimate ones that he submitted and people went there engaged in violent
(56:00) behavior and they managed to delay the certification of the election which is exactly so then do you admit then do you admit then that they happen to do
(56:06) exactly even if I grant your they happen to do every single thing that an Insurrection called for without actually
(56:12) engaging an interaction give me a chance to respond so I not only not only do I concede nothing but your logic we ran
(56:19) out of time on that round so what I'll do is this I can see that this is a dynamic conversation and clearly it's going to go out the bounds sometimes of
(56:25) a Time round so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to go ahead and set the clock for 10 minutes uh that that
(56:32) completes round one of the open discourse but I see that this is dynamic argument me just stopping it randomly at 5 minutes would probably be stupid so
(56:39) I'm going to let it play out I'll put 10 minutes on the clock and have you guys go at it is that okay with both of you yeah I'm fine with that sure are you
(56:45) okay with that yeah okay so because I don't want to interrupt you guys again like that so I'll just go ahead and put 10 minutes on the clock uh and I will
(56:53) start it right now you guys you can pick right off where you left off and sorry about so so to respond right and I'll be
(56:59) more charitable with the time back your way now that we have 10 minutes Destiny but it's actually an illogical argument
(57:04) to make to say even if Donald Trump had some certain intent in his head uh that
(57:09) would not mean that the people who were showing up for the protest had that intent so the thing is is like for you
(57:15) both ways it's a double on Tandra for your own logic either one you claim wait a second there was one clear reason
(57:21) everybody showed up or two no there was no clear reason why everybody showed up they had multiple motivations even if
(57:26) Trump himself had a different motivation this is illogical argumentation I'm sorry but this would never be applied to
(57:32) anything if somebody says hey guys we're all going to show up we can go I'm making the argument right now if somebody were to make the call and say
(57:38) hey guys we're all going to show up to go and blow this building up and a bunch of people showed up and then a bunch of them marched with the crowd and then
(57:43) they all went and a building got blown up we wouldn't say like oh well we don't know what the intention of the crowd was we don't know what the intention of the
(57:49) leader there was we don't know what actually happened that because we can't Divine the intention of every single individual purp that's ridic we can say
(57:56) you can call it a straw man but the idea that in order for me okay hold on what would it what would I need to show then
(58:02) no no no no no wait wait hold on what would I need to show what would I need to show sping let me responding but you're not even letting you're not even
(58:08) letting me talk you can respond to my argument you can phrase the question an argument let me respond and then you can ask the second argument I think that
(58:14) that's fair okay so when you're talking about this from a logical standpoint when you say oh if somebody called and
(58:20) said hey we're all going to blow this building up yes I would agree that you could probably ascribe the motivation to it then can you show me a treat a tweet
(58:27) or any type of anything from Donald Trump saying hey guys show up we're going to do an Insurrection no he just
(58:32) made the [ __ ] up okay fine so I can so as part of Donald Trump's speech I'll give you two quotes our country has had enough we will not take it anymore and
(58:39) that's what this is all about and use a favorite term that all you people really came up with we will stop the steal
(58:45) today I will lay out just some of the evidence proving that we won this election and we won it by a landslide this was not a close election the first
(58:51) quote the second quote we must stop the steal and then we must ensure that such outrageous election fraud never happens
(58:57) again can never be allowed to happen again when he says stop the steal when they're at the capital building on January 6th and when the election is
(59:03) being certified what to stop the steel mean there uh wait a second so first of all you're attributing to Donald Trump's
(59:10) rhetoric here uh something which he may not have intended none of that actually shows or demonstrates that he was
(59:16) calling for an Insurrection on the capital you are just kind of ascribing that motivation onto it for the purposes
(59:23) of convenience you have to show me there where he calls like your example was if
(59:29) I say we're all going to show up and blow up this building that was your example and then people show up and do it we can understand their motivation I
(59:35) agree you have to show me where he says okay guys we're all going to show up and do an Insurrection you can't then take words that don't say anything about an
(59:41) Insurrection and say but I think he meant that though so then just before I answer this what would I have to show
(59:47) you to show that an Insurrection was what Trump was planning what kind of you would have to give me the you would have to give me the criteria first and
(59:54) foremost of something which fit the criteria of an Insurrection better than some other thing and you would have to
(1:00:01) make it refutable to that thing from what people were charged under so if the
(1:00:07) if the criteria is I'm going to give you what I think an Insurrection is and it fits a different criteria better than an
(1:00:14) Insurrection and and under that criteria that's what people were basically charged under then it sounds like the
(1:00:20) other thing makes more sense than an Insurrection so we going with the AR event have happened ex like some person
(1:00:26) needs to have been charged with the crime no your logic there is faulty well then why why do you have the second
(1:00:32) element there me on you can't just talk for 20 minutes and then as soon as I say one sentence you ramble and ask you a
(1:00:39) question and then ask another question as part of my question I'm able to do that but I wasn't even a two elements to what needed I needed to prove um the
(1:00:45) second one was that I have to show why people weren't charged with a crime I've answered this thing 50 million times we can send her on Justice one point if you
(1:00:51) want just because somebody hasn't been charged with the crime of X doesn't mean that an event related to X didn't Ur
(1:00:56) this is true of the opposite would equally be true the opposite is also true just because they weren't charged
(1:01:02) with the crime of X doesn't mean they committed the crime of X either making that argument you're using this argument
(1:01:08) as a way to negate my argument just because I'm not making call counter argument yes no hold on that would be
(1:01:14) like you saying Jon couldn't have murdered Jane because JN wasn't there and then I say well no that's not true and then you're going well just because
(1:01:19) John was there doesn't mean that he murdered Jane that's not the element that I'm giving giv you four clear things
(1:01:26) wait wait hang on the oppos argument that or give me a definition of insurrection or do you think it's hang
(1:01:31) on hang on the opposite is true I'm not saying that so you say oh John murdered
(1:01:36) Jane uh but that can't be true because he also may not have murdered Jane you're making the claim John murdered
(1:01:42) Jane and so I say okay that's your claim that he murdered Jane can you define for me what the criteria would be in which
(1:01:48) you would consider this to be murder and you go well and then you define for me something that is not murder or fit some
(1:01:54) other criteria would not a rational human being including you take that and understand
(1:02:01) wait if it fits this other criteria better it probably isn't actually murder what part of my how can you give me an
(1:02:07) example I'm just curious and I shouldn't even engage with this because so just up to this point you've given me no definition of insurrection you seem
(1:02:12) unwilling to commit to my yeah I understand that but I'm just saying you've given me no definition Insurrection you seem uning to do so so
(1:02:18) my question would be can you give me a riot can you give me a riot that would fit all four points that I've given of
(1:02:27) well then you must accept my definition of insurrection because you're saying that my definition of insurrection isn't
(1:02:33) valid because it also applies to riots and I'm telling you very clearly no it doesn't because riots don't typically happen in a planned manner to contravene
(1:02:40) the uh execution of some government function or the implementation of some particular law that's not what your definition says your definition says
(1:02:47) resisting some law or interfering with the course of a government proceeding correct yeah so you're just changing your definition I'm not resisting do you
(1:02:53) think that resisting a law is the same thing as breaking a law uh I think that it could be
(1:03:00) synonymous inside of people's minds but no I could see the distinction with Merit but when you say resisting any law
(1:03:06) or interfering with the course of a government proceeding that sure sounds like a riot to me Destiny okay can you
(1:03:12) give me an example of a riot where that happens where yeah where BLM burned down a police station that seems like it's um
(1:03:19) res yeah so that's what what law were they resisting the implementation of what law were theys the law of
(1:03:26) of laws so you're you're telling me that those rights were trying to make it so that our sin was legal can you point me
(1:03:32) to a tweet can you point me to a statement where somebody was saying we're rioting because we think that the laws against ARS are can you show me
(1:03:38) your definition where it says that the purpose of the Insurrection is so that they can make something else legal cuz
(1:03:44) that's nowhere in your definition resisting any law or interfering with the course of a government proceeding does say about making something else
(1:03:51) legal you just made it up no you're what you're saying that they're resisting the law of arson nobody's arguing that the
(1:03:56) law of arson is bad just because you're breaking a law doesn't mean you're resisting the law what's the or what's the or the or for what it says or
(1:04:05) interfering with the course of a government proceeding would you not consider if somebody interfered with the
(1:04:11) FBI for instance for that to be interfering with the course of a government proceeding or if somebody interfered with police officers that
(1:04:17) that would be interfering with the course of a government police officers are not federal police officers you want to talk about interfering if you want to
(1:04:23) talk about if you want to you are cuz we're talking about January 6 not we have your definition it's not where did January 6th happen who but it do we have
(1:04:32) your definition why would I be arguing about the definition of an Insurrection in a state when we're talking about an Insurrection that happened on the can
(1:04:38) you show me in your definition where it says it must be Federal for we're talking about ins the fedal it doesn't
(1:04:43) matter so then any any of the criteria which would apply at the state level would still apply at the federal level for rioting it's the same know if
(1:04:50) insurrections are State defined I'm not aware of that in the historical record can you point somewhere State insurrection not aware of some can you
(1:04:56) show me we're in the historical record with that's I'm just asking why you couldn't have one because I'm not aware of any having occurred historically that doesn't mean you couldn't have one you
(1:05:03) just claimed that it's possible I didn't make a claim oh okay then we're not no one is claiming here that an Insurrection State no you are making a
(1:05:09) claim you're making a claim positive claim that there could be a federal Insurrection because because I have a
(1:05:14) historical record of there being statements about insurrections federally and historically I've never had a statement about a state Insurrection I'm
(1:05:21) not aware of any of those if you are aware one of those not being aware of any doesn't mean that the criteria could
(1:05:26) not apply to a state Insurrection correct that's correct but we are talking about an Insurrection that happened on federal grounds so we're
(1:05:32) obviously talking your definition doesn't require Federal anything that's not what your definition requires okay I
(1:05:38) think um uh if this is if if the only hold out you have is that your definition of resisting a particular law
(1:05:44) just means that you are breaking a law then I think I'm satisfied at ending it oh no it's not or interfering with a
(1:05:50) course of a government proceeding this could be localized or non-localized can't be no one here has made any CL about a nonfederal okay well if those
(1:05:55) are your two holdouts that you think what what do or interfering with the course of a government proceeding mean
(1:06:01) what does that mean the record that I'm invoking where especially talking about things relating to Insurrection and we're talking about the invocation of
(1:06:06) insurrection which is my understanding has only ever happened in federal law and in stuff relating to the United States government not a state government
(1:06:13) if you want to show me it happening or show me a historical record or a state constitution or a state criminal statute that references Insurrection then we can
(1:06:19) talk about that if you want to what does or interfering with the course of a government proceeding mean Destiny or
(1:06:25) interfering with of course the implementation or the execution of some particular federal law it has to be
(1:06:30) Federal yes because we're talking about the federal government that doesn't mean hang on hang on hang on so you're you're
(1:06:36) you're doing a classic kind of Destiny bait and switch where you say in this particular case it would because that's
(1:06:42) what we're talking about okay that's fair but that doesn't mean that that's what the definition says the definition
(1:06:48) itself does not say that it must be Federal it doesn't with my what definition you refer say that anywhere
(1:06:55) what does or interfering with the course of a government proceeding mean what does it mean that real quick guys that
(1:07:01) is 10 minutes um what I could do is because I see that there's a discussion here between Federal you know if an
(1:07:07) Insurrection can be federal or state I will go ahead and reset the clock I think maybe this is something that we
(1:07:12) can kind of hone in on can an Insurrection be uh we obviously we're talking about it from federal level but
(1:07:18) can also be at a state level do you guys want to shift that conversation to there and make this round specifically for that are you guys okay with that it's I
(1:07:24) don't know I don't I don't the a state Insurrection I'm just not even aware of that even being a thing I don't I don't think I've ever heard of I don't
(1:07:30) know Destiny were the DC cops local I'll put the clock for DC cops were Federal no all of them were Federal eh the the
(1:07:37) District of Columbia is is federal yes they have no they have no State Police there at all what state police would
(1:07:43) they have there I don't know I'm just asking I don't believe so no I'm pretty sure even the National Guard there
(1:07:48) directly like the chain of command goes up to the president not a state govern stat do states have state governments yes okay I don't understand why you
(1:07:55) couldn't have an Insurrection against the state government by this consult the historical record and come with an example next time well just because you
(1:08:01) never have I'm asking you if you can I'm not here to debate whether or not you can have an Insurrection against the state government I'm here to debate
(1:08:07) whether or not January 6 with an Insurrection because January 6 no this is like asking if a murder occurred uh
(1:08:12) on January 6th in that case I would only be talking about murder as it's defined in federal law not in state law we're
(1:08:18) talking about an Insurrection on whether or not January 6th was an Insurrection or not so I'm only going to be appealing to federal law or federal historical
(1:08:24) understandings of insurrection so I don't know why we're saying what about a state Insurrection I don't know I'm not even aware a state Insurrection is a
(1:08:29) possible I've never heard that reference it's not semantic it's legal and it's hisorical and that's where the understanding is I'm fine with a
(1:08:35) semantic distinction I'm not I'm not saying there's anything wrong with it I'm actually just trying to make one so
(1:08:40) it you you agree that this that you gave me a definition that it nowhere includes
(1:08:45) the word Federal correct it's we're T I also didn't give you a definition that includes the word human or that includes
(1:08:52) the words like in this present point of time and not like in the future or time traveling in the past or that doesn't include like Dimension c138 or that like
(1:08:59) there's a million other things that I didn't include I don't know what that has to do with anything because why would I include the definition of
(1:09:04) against the United States when we're talking about an Insurrection that happened on federal grounds it's because
(1:09:10) well because if you want okay well in that case I will simply add on my second part aren't you
(1:09:16) appealing to a state court for instance like what what are you talking about here appealing to a state court for what
(1:09:22) aren't aren't you appealing to a state court for this definition isn't that what you said did I get that wrong I'm
(1:09:28) I'm appealing to right now I'm appealing to Federal history what are you what are you talking about well I'm just I'm asking where did you get this definition
(1:09:34) let's start with that uh there is a uh there's a writer who studied um I think
(1:09:41) it was I think it was constitutional law specializing in the 4th amendment uh his name is uh Mark Graber and these are the
(1:09:46) four qualifications that he basically lists out and then he goes through a number of historical examples to say as much there's also a much longer paper
(1:09:51) written about the um I think it's like the the sweeping power of section three written by um I think bod and pulson who
(1:09:59) write like 130 page paper where they go through listing like the historical understanding of insurrection uh if you want we can dive through any part of the
(1:10:05) paper or we can dive through any part of defition he say in this paper that it's a requirement that this be done at the
(1:10:12) federal level nobody I don't think anybody talks about State
(1:10:17) insurrections I don't think you can Levy war or engageing Insurrection against a state I'm just not aware of that I've never heard of that brought up before I
(1:10:25) don't think like for like when you say treason if I were to give you a definition of treason I don't know if I don't know if you can commit treason
(1:10:30) against like the state of Iowa I I think that's only a federal crime I have no I have no idea either this why I'm asking
(1:10:37) well I I can't say dis I can't say for sure because I maybe there is an Evidence of it out there but I didn't come prepared to debate that because
(1:10:43) this is a debate about Federal a federal is doing an internal critique to try to figure out if this is consistent
(1:10:50) across the board your definition I'm not even saying that there's necessarily anything wrong with it but what I I'm saying is that there's something wrong
(1:10:56) with the fact that it seems to fit rioting far better than it would in Insurrection so if we go over these one
(1:11:02) at a time an assemblage would fit a riot that's what Destiny says by force or intimidation fits a riot that's what
(1:11:08) Destiny says or assemblage of people for an assemblage of people for a common
(1:11:13) purpose okay an assemblage of people yes so they come for a common common purpose okay and then two is to resist any law
(1:11:20) or interfering with the course of a government proceeding right resisting a law resisting a law that's not breaking a law but you're there to to resist a
(1:11:27) particular law there's one you really don't like and then three you're showing up for force or intimidation we have the or there we have the or interfering with
(1:11:34) the course of a government proceeding wouldn't that be even resisting police wouldn't that qualify for that no a
(1:11:40) government proceeding would be like the like the um like the Senate confirming like a like an officer of the of the
(1:11:47) executive agency or like demonstrate that I don't believe that that's true I think that you can you can interfere
(1:11:52) with government proceedings uh even even absent there being some actual
(1:11:57) proceeding that you're interfering with I think that localized laws that's fine and if
(1:12:02) you would like to introduce your own unique definition of insurrection you can do that but because I'm unaware in the historical record of anybody
(1:12:09) suggesting that interfering with police officers is a matter of of insurrection or can lead to an element of
(1:12:15) insurrection I'm are there laws against rioting I don't know if I'm not sure I know there's laws against like things
(1:12:21) that happen in rioting I don't know if there's like a law of rioting are you are you resisting those law when you're rting no you're not resisting those laws
(1:12:28) when you're unless you're literally rioting to say we should make rioting legal or we need to get rid of the prohibition on writing and that's wait
(1:12:35) why would that be a qualification to resist the laws because breaking the law and resist do you acknowledge that breaking the law and resisting La not
(1:12:41) the same thing well tell me what the distinction is so I'm not confused anymore breaking a law is when you do something that's illegal and resisting
(1:12:47) the law is saying that this particular law shouldn't exist yeah okay but if you're rioting
(1:12:54) how do you go about resisting a law well you could Riot for the purpose of
(1:12:59) overturning a particular law you might say I don't like resisting other laws then right no you're not you're not
(1:13:04) saying that writing should be made legal yeah but even if you weren't you would still be resisting laws that were on the
(1:13:10) books against rioting you're so if I can't divor okay we can just disagree here if you think
(1:13:16) that resisting and breaking the law are the same thing we just we're at an impact I didn't say that they're the same thing I said that necessarily if
(1:13:22) you're rioting to resist some other external law so let's say I think do you
(1:13:27) agree you can do this really EAS do you agree that you can engage in writing no no do you agree that you can engage in writing and accept that you might get arrested for
(1:13:34) writing um yeah do that defeats your entire argument you can engage in writing without resisting the law of writing understanding well I'm going to
(1:13:40) write but actually that makes my argument that makes my argument so the thing is is that even if I concede that
(1:13:46) it's true that you could be um you know rioting with the expectation that you get arrested for this x thing right you
(1:13:53) could do this for murder as well you could do this for basically anything you can commit any crime with the expectation that you could be arrested
(1:13:59) for the crime itself but that would not say that you're not resisting whatever the current laws were that were on the
(1:14:05) books about that crime you're saying that the necessity here is that you are resisting some other thing fine but
(1:14:10) you're also resisting laws by the very nature of rioting so I don't know why you would have to have something which
(1:14:16) is externalized why you yourself are still breaking laws I don't how are you resisting the law how are you resisting
(1:14:22) laws of rioting by rioting what does resist mean to you then how you resist yeah yeah so assuming I can
(1:14:29) give you an example of this let us assume for a second that people are rioting in an abortion clinic because
(1:14:34) they want abortion overturned I think this is the spirit of your argument right so they're rioting in an abortion
(1:14:40) clinic they they want abortion to be overturned you would agree with me then
(1:14:46) that they are pushing against abortion but they're still breaking laws while they're rioting right so they are
(1:14:53) resisting current law La even though they're resisting another current law and I don't think that you would consider that to be an Insurrection even
(1:15:00) though it could fit all of the criteria of these elements it's an assemblage for sure uh you're resisting some other law
(1:15:08) that you don't like or you're interfering with the course of a government proceeding you would say that that fits criteria too you would say
(1:15:15) that this is by force or intimidation and you would say it's for a public purpose but that clearly is not an
(1:15:20) Insurrection Destiny the the the issue is like abortion is not like a this isn't a
(1:15:27) federal law I could just grant you that we can move to the state example since you seem unable or unwilling to differentiate second that it was let's
(1:15:34) assume for a second it was a federal law okay you know what actually we can do that let's say that the federal
(1:15:39) government passed a law either allowing or uh not allowing all uh all abortion
(1:15:46) okay the government either allows it uh everybody can have abortion whenever they want or nobody give abortion okay let's say that I gather a group of
(1:15:51) people and I say listen Okay [ __ ] this abortion law we going to get together and we're going to go protest okay and
(1:15:58) we're protesting the goal of our protest all right is we want to we want to get rid of the abortion thing whether it was
(1:16:03) passed or or made illegal okay we want to get rid of this law and we're going to show up with a whole bunch of [ __ ]
(1:16:09) people and shit's going to get R and we're going to you know we know what we're doing okay it's the day that in Capitol Hill that they're going to sign
(1:16:15) the law and whatever we March down there and in the course of protesting like it becomes a riot um and the then the riot
(1:16:21) and everything there was because of that particular law being signed into practice I would say yeah yeah that was an Insurrection you've shown up with a
(1:16:26) group of people you're resisting the passage of some particular law you're showing up through force or intimidation
(1:16:33) um and you end up exercising that and then it's for the public purpose of a particular law that impacts everybody in
(1:16:38) the United States I would say that is an Insurrection yes would you say so if so if not an Insurrection yeah I would say
(1:16:44) that it would not be an Insurrection at least by this criteria that would just seem to me again to be a riot that would
(1:16:50) seem to fit the criteria again of a riot better than an Insurrection I still can't exactly figure out the delineation
(1:16:56) point and I'm trying to and now to be fair to you it is nebulous I understand it's nebulous but I'm also not the one
(1:17:02) who's making the affirmative claim you are so you're saying that if a bunch of [ __ ] dope smoking hippies wanted to
(1:17:09) resist the federal law of being able to smoke marijuana on Federal Land and they all showed up and they got stoned and
(1:17:14) then they started rioting that that would be a [ __ ] Insurrection if they went there with a common purpose they
(1:17:20) were trying to resist the uh implementation execution of a particular law um yeah theoretically it could well
(1:17:26) no they're just resisting right they're just resisting a law they're saying we're here to protest the fact man that
(1:17:31) we can't smoke weed on federal property man so they all grab their blunts and they start toking up and protest right
(1:17:38) and then they start a fire kick some stuff and kick some stuff do you think that is that hang on I just want to make sure you think it could be that would be
(1:17:45) an ins the historical record it could be yes do you have any definition of insurrection whatsoever or do you just think to give you a counter defition if
(1:17:51) you're not going to give me a counter definition I can give you the riot doesn't include um necessarily a public
(1:17:58) P purpose I've already given examples of riots that wouldn't fit my definition of insurrection and I really only need to give one and I automatically win um a
(1:18:04) riot could very much be in response to a particular sports team winning a game boom that's an example of a riot it doesn't fit my definition of an
(1:18:10) Insurrection I've different the two and unless you're going to give me any counterveiling definitions I automatically satisfy that element of
(1:18:16) but I already did interfering with the course of a government proceeding in and of itself I think that the necessity of
(1:18:22) rioting in and of itself what if you block ha Federal Highway wait the necessity of rioting in and of itself
(1:18:27) wait what no no hold on wait wait wait wait wait to be clear I do do you acknowledge do you acknowledge that just
(1:18:33) gave you do you acknowledge that I just gave you an example of a riot that wouldn't be an Insurrection under my definitions so I think that that would
(1:18:39) even be appropriate I think that you could give me tons of definitions of riots that would not fit this definition
(1:18:45) of an Insurrection but that would not mean that this definition doesn't fit the definition of Riot better than
(1:18:50) Insurrection you understand wait so if somebody was protesting and it got really violent after a sports game how would my definition fit that better than
(1:18:57) Insurrection fit that better than what if they were blockading a Federal Highway would that be interfering with the course of government proceedings
(1:19:03) because there's a federal law that says you can't blockade byways on federal highways I mean this is the thing I
(1:19:09) don't know I don't think that count so do you see what I mean though this becomes so broad that we can begin
(1:19:16) to just add all sorts of things and call them insurrections what is the government proceeding let me give you an
(1:19:21) example so if we're going to be totally good faith here right which I've been trying to be this entire debate and I
(1:19:26) think he would concede that if we're going to be really good faith here do you really believe that if a bunch of
(1:19:32) hippies showed up to smoke a bunch of dope on federal property okay and a few
(1:19:38) of them got wild and started a fire and kicked some [ __ ] right and I don't know
(1:19:43) uh you know somebody got beat up with a bat because there was tens of thousands of them who showed up for that protest do you really believe that that would
(1:19:50) fit the criteria of what most people think of including you as an insurrection
(1:19:55) uh if they if they didn't go they United by like a particular public purpose um the public purpose was they were going
(1:20:00) against this federal law they don't want the federal law they're resisting that feder so we don't have to waste any more time on this if you want to Stack this
(1:20:07) enough all I'm going to end up doing is saying that like yes this would agree as I would agree that this would be an Insurrection you have it you're not able
(1:20:13) to demonstrate this is why I'm asking you like historically can you give me an example of an event that you don't think I would want to classify as an Insurrection classify as an inter but if
(1:20:20) you're just going to give me examples you're just going to make you're going to build these events more and more and say yeah I would say that was an
(1:20:25) Insurrection nobody in good faith anywhere is going to agree with you that
(1:20:31) if a bunch of hippie showed up to resist the marijuana lawn Federal property and then a few of them started a riot that
(1:20:37) they would consider that Insurrection against the United States I don't believe you believe it I don't believe your audience believes it I don't
(1:20:43) believe anybody believes it so if that is the case that it's so broad that that will encapsulate that I'm actually fine
(1:20:50) leaving the debate there too okay I mean again it doesn't really matter what we would consider Ed to be an Insurrection
(1:20:56) the only that matters is what the historical record says at the time um was considered an
(1:21:01) Insurrection literally nobody's Prosecuting anybody for it so it you don't have to i' well you're just
(1:21:07) retreading technically I think this might be a Gish go is when you keep bringing up arguments that have been rebuked over and over and over again you
(1:21:12) can keep bringing it up over and over and over again but again do we agree that like we can walk in and see wow this person was murdered and go oh
(1:21:17) really who was charged with murder okay or wow wow there sure is a riot here we saw that a ride happened well who's charged with riding well I guess like we
(1:21:23) don't you don't need a charge of a particular crime and the barrier or the bar for charging somebody with a particular crime is probably a lot
(1:21:30) higher than declaring an event a thing itself just doesn't make any sense to say because somebody hasn't been charged with a particular thing a certain sense
(1:21:36) to we're not talking about criminal charges it also doesn't make any sense that to say that because they haven't been charged with a particular thing
(1:21:42) that means they're guilty of the particular thing either that's multip my
(1:21:47) criteria does actually flow with this my criteria is not because they weren't
(1:21:53) charged that's why it wasn't instruction I never used that as part of my criteria I don't know why yeah well hippie everywhere don't show up to Federal
(1:21:58) property to protest by smoking weed and because if a couple of you start a fire you're going to get brought up on Insurrection charges and nobody ever
(1:22:06) that's insane we're not no I don't know why we keep bringing up Insurrection charges no one is talking about a criminal charge or criminal proceeding here that's not criminal charge or
(1:22:12) criminal proceeding you would that would be a charge right no talking about that here nobody's talking about criminal charges here or criminal proceedings
(1:22:18) here so you but but you would still consider that an Insurrection right an Insurrection doesn't have to be a
(1:22:23) criminal matter I just want to make sure that you would still consider that an Insurrection if all four elements of what I said were met then yes all right
(1:22:29) fine well then I'll leave the debate there I'm good with that so what I'll do so we went seven rounds here uh and I
(1:22:37) was just timing it and everything else like that I see that there's obviously a difference of opinion and definitions what fits what Etc so what I'll do is
(1:22:43) I'll go to closing arguments uh I'll put are you both okay with a three minutes
(1:22:48) on the clock to make your closing argument or I can make it a little bit longer if you guys want and then we can
(1:22:53) close that after that yeah what whatever you guys want to do I'm fine with are you okay with three or do you want more uh three is probably fine three minutes
(1:23:00) okay uh who wants to go first uh well I open first so usually
(1:23:07) person who opens closes last okay so uh Destiny I'll turn it to you I'll put
(1:23:12) three minutes on the clock and you can put your uh closing arguments here and uh this was a fantastic discussion
(1:23:18) obviously you know you have a good debate when the chat is like you know almost 50/50 so um I'll go ahead and
(1:23:25) turn it to you Destiny and you can uh give us your closing arguments and then I'll go turn it to Andrew yeah I mean historically like there have been
(1:23:30) examples of things that were considered insurrections that were incredibly small in nature right I don't I don't know if
(1:23:36) anybody died at all in the Whiskey Rebellion I'm pretty sure everybody that got arrested for that was like acquitted uh it was just people basically
(1:23:42) essentially uh protesting the the whiskey tax laws um this wasn't a massive deal that had like explosions
(1:23:48) and gunfire and deaths everywhere I think that we just don't tend to view things as insurrections as much anymore because we don't tend to have
(1:23:53) insurrections as much any anymore because that's kind of become the new Norm uh as the United States has you know traveled through or journeyed
(1:23:59) through time um I think that the four elements that I gave I think we're pretty clearly met on January 6th I
(1:24:04) think I've demonstrated that we can imagine a ton of events that are riots that wouldn't fit the four uh elements I
(1:24:10) understand that Andrew has a really hard time understanding that between resisting a law versus just breaking a law just because somebody goes out and
(1:24:16) they engage in rioting doesn't mean that they are trying to resist the law of rioting that they're trying to make it that rioting is legal that's the goal of
(1:24:23) that particular riot uh often times riots can be said to come together to protest other types of things where people feel like the law isn't being
(1:24:29) executed in a reasonable manner um to say that a bunch of people that show up and end up writing uh as a result of a protest that's against like say a cop
(1:24:35) they feel like wasn't fairly prosecuted is the same as a bunch of people showing up to resist the certification of the vote as laid out in the Electoral count
(1:24:42) Act is just not at all the same thing but we can continue to misread the seconde element of this and I understand
(1:24:47) why and that's because if you grant the definition or any definition of insurrection January 6th almost certainly follows from it and the only
(1:24:53) way to Escape January 6 is being labeled as an Insurrection is to use either a ridiculous um type of definition that
(1:24:59) literally nobody historically has ever agreed to and again you will never find Historical citations people that use these very unique and contrived
(1:25:05) definitions of insurrection or you set this uh bar of evidence as being unbelievably High uh which is saying
(1:25:10) something like Donald Trump needed to say hey everybody we're going to go do an Insurrection and absent that even if
(1:25:16) he's telling people to fight like hell even if he's tweeting the day before uh vice president Pence has the ability to overturn the election uh even if he's
(1:25:22) saying like you know we need to go down in March and fight like hell and Country back none of these things are going to matter if they don't actually use the word Insurrection which I guess means
(1:25:28) there's no such thing as an Insurrection ever having uh having occurred in all of you's history uh I would say that if you argue with somebody who doesn't believe
(1:25:34) in a particular definition of insurrection ask them has any Insurrection ever occurred ever which would you consider an Insurrection um
(1:25:39) and then once they start to consider something an Insurrection say hey well what are the elements that make this an Insurrection or even more you could say
(1:25:45) historically what have judges and lawmakers considered an Insurrection people like Andrew will never do that instead they will just play word games
(1:25:50) all day and try to say well riots fit and what about States and all these other things aren't really relevant to defining an interaction which however
(1:25:56) you define it January 6th clearly was all right okay that was 2 minutes and 30 seconds I will turn it to you Andrew to
(1:26:04) make your closing arguments and then Andrew from what I understand you wanted to open up the phone lines right and have a discussion with the people after
(1:26:10) yeah I'm fine with that uh even if Destiny has other places to go I'm willing to stick around for call-ins I've always done that on The Crucible
(1:26:16) sure um and I'm sure I'm sure there's people right now as we speak um bills is um firing up the phone line so we'll get
(1:26:22) that phone number out and put it on the screen and you you guys can Des if you want to stay you can Telegraph it to your audience and we can answer some
(1:26:27) questions for the people but I will turn it to you Andrew to make your uh closing arguments yeah well it's really it's
(1:26:34) really funny this appeal to Authority Destiny grabs this entire nebulous definition from some guy that he respects on the internet and then claims
(1:26:40) that this is some authoritative definition this is the authoritative definition because I read it from some guy on the internet oh okay great even
(1:26:47) though the courts themselves not ruled on this and nobody was charged with Insurrection nobody was Char again one
(1:26:53) more time time nobody charged with Insurrection Trump acquitted of inciting an Insurrection which again nobody was
(1:26:59) charged with talk about nebulous definition he says I'm playing word games meanwhile he takes time today all
(1:27:06) day to assemble a fourpoint uh you know kind of this is my definition completely
(1:27:13) based on some other guy on the internet which is crazy to me right this is
(1:27:18) Destiny's personal definition personal definition of what this means and it
(1:27:23) clearly fits three of the criteria for rioting right off the gate we only had an issue with two and then when we apply
(1:27:30) these and remember my opening statement I said in my opening statement this is going to become very broad right there's
(1:27:36) no way that we're not going to be able to call all sorts of things insurrections that clearly are not insurrections we come up with the idea
(1:27:43) of what if a bunch of dope smoking hippies all show up with the United purpose of smoking dope on Federal Land
(1:27:49) in order to resist the federal law and then a couple of them start a fire and one get beaten up with a baseball bat or
(1:27:55) something like this suddenly that's an Insurrection clearly nobody would think that that was an Insurrection clearly
(1:28:02) nobody would think that that's a completely unreasonable standard right but it's the destiny standard and the
(1:28:08) reason again that he had to have such a broad definition the reason that he needed this and he needed me to come in
(1:28:15) and give him some definition he could do an internal critique on is because his idea that this was an Insurrection is
(1:28:20) only there specifically to villainize the opposition for the purposes of demonization so that when bad things
(1:28:26) happen to them he can call them traitors that's it that's the whole game it's been his whole game now for a while and
(1:28:34) this is what got him on peers and all these other things which I recently reviewed was that take and so in order
(1:28:39) for him to justify that take he has to make you a traitor because you don't believe that that was an Insurrection
(1:28:45) that nobody was charged with okay uh 215 uh guys that was [ __ ] fantastic
(1:28:52) discuss um know obviously people are going to have different viewpoints on where they go but that's I think the
(1:28:57) beauty of any discussion like this in debate that it you know good debate always has people with different viewpoints saying like oh I think this
(1:29:03) guy did better I think this guy did better so great discussion from both I am going to open up the phone lines right now uh I think the number it's

(1:31:17) on the line right yeah okay brother uh tell us your name where you're from and hit us with your question uh my name is r Rick from Miami
(1:31:25) Florida the question is for Andrew uh very frustrating on his side to see the
(1:31:31) debate on his side so I really do need an answer of what his definition is for an
(1:31:37) Insurrection are you asking me my definition Andrews I'm yeah I'm not
(1:31:43) going to give you one it's not my burden I feel like that's a cop out okay
(1:31:50) that's no well then you need to learn how to debate because you not knowing how to debate doesn't mean that I'm coping out it's not my position the
(1:31:57) affirmative position the person calling people insurrectionist is not me wait how are we supposed to have a debate on
(1:32:02) if January 6 was an Insurrection if you don't even have a definition of insurrection why do I need to have an a definition to note that whatever
(1:32:08) definition that you could come up with would be too broad to apply to this that's not a logical statement either
(1:32:14) Desy hold on came in with he came in with some some some points but you
(1:32:20) didn't okay um Andrew you want to respond to him on that or I think we
(1:32:26) missed like 30 yeah I'm sorry we were we were having an exchange I missed the actual question I I think his main
(1:32:31) criticism is he wants to know what your definition of insurrection is is that correct caller correct yeah it's not it's not
(1:32:38) it's not my burden point on on his definition of an Insurrection it's not my burden which way to not to not answer
(1:32:48) that kind of a a definitional question and he's using the words it's not my burden to cop out of that definition
(1:32:55) question okay why how is it my burden an Insurrection so so let me ask you let me ask you a question caller okay let's
(1:33:02) assume for a second I didn't know what murder was and you were trying to give me the criteria for what murder was
(1:33:08) could I logically give you a criticism for why that actually would fit some something else that I do know what it is
(1:33:15) better than the idea of murder do you do you understand that
(1:33:21) caller yes uh well then what is criticis think what you're asking me is I think what you're asking me is is if if
(1:33:28) something that you think fits another definition would you be able to apply to that definition and you could no that's
(1:33:34) not what I'm asking you not providing an actual argument to that like all you're saying is well this could create
(1:33:40) something else but you're not saying no I'm giving what's called an internal critique an internal critique doesn't
(1:33:45) necessitate an argument hold on this doesn't make an internal criticism if the debate has to do with whether or not
(1:33:51) a person was murdered if that's the debate was was joh murdered and the entire debate is just you critiquing
(1:33:57) another person's definition of murder but you're unwilling to put forth your own definition of murder the implication is that you were never prepared to
(1:34:02) debate the actual topic of the debate which is if somebody that's not the implication that doesn't even make any sense so Destiny let me ask you a
(1:34:08) counter question my argument is that is arguing in bad faith okay that's not not only is that not arguing in bad faith
(1:34:14) it's arguing in the best faith Destiny Destiny knew for sure that he had the burden not me thing next call let's get
(1:34:21) the next call wait wait wait wait quick hold cuz has to be answered hold on how could you possibly deal with the topic
(1:34:27) if you don't have a definition of insurrection well let's try I I was just getting to that so let me let me ask you
(1:34:32) Destiny let us assume for a second that you weren't sure exactly what murder meant you weren't exactly sure what the
(1:34:39) criteria was another person was calling this group of people a murderer right you had kind of an idea maybe of what
(1:34:45) that was and so you went to them and you said okay can you tell me what you mean by murder and they gave you some other
(1:34:51) criteria that fit way better with something other than their definition of murder why would that be illogical or in
(1:34:58) any way unreasonable that's not illogical and that's not unreasonable but that would only be that would only mean that you would be successful if the
(1:35:04) debate was is Destiny's definition of insurrection satisfactory in so far as
(1:35:09) defining January 6 as an Insurrection but that wasn't the debate topic it wasn't just my definition of insurrection the debate was okay wait so
(1:35:16) how can do you do you agree that the prompt of the debate was is January was January 6th an Insurrection yeah why
(1:35:21) does that mean that I have how can you answer that wait do you not have to answer the prompt to a debate yeah so
(1:35:27) I'm not taking that I'm neutral on it it could have been I was willing to oh you have no position I was willing to
(1:35:33) concede that it could have been I said right in my opening in good faith I'll make concessions based under a b and c
(1:35:39) criteria if he can make these demonstrations you never did okay so then just to be clear then just so we're
(1:35:45) all so the The Prompt for the debate was was January 6th an Insurrection and I came in with a positive and you came in
(1:35:51) with no position no it wasn't no position it was that it's possible that it was it's possible that it wasn't and
(1:35:58) I was willing I was willing to hear you no it's a neutral position that's not no position somebody's looking I'm sorry is
(1:36:04) neutral not a position not not really no oh no not really does that mean no or yes Destiny is neutral a position or
(1:36:10) isn't it for the purposes of having a debate no oh for the purposes of having a debate you can't have a neutral
(1:36:16) position Des somebody Stell thei the best leftist debater on planet Earth ladies and gentlemen neutral on a debate
(1:36:22) topic not a position not to have as a debater that's correct if there was a debate say debate saying is God real and
(1:36:28) one person shows up and say I I'm arguing the affirmative God is real and the other person says I take I'm a neutral position on that I guess you
(1:36:34) never I guess you've never debated with an agnostic before who's neutral they're not a debate on what that would be a debate on agnosticism or nosism not a
(1:36:41) debate on whether God is real or not real why couldn't you why couldn't you go into a debate agnostic about God
(1:36:47) being real or not real Destiny can you explain that real quick because definitionally an agnostic doesn't take a position on or doesn't think they can
(1:36:52) have knowledge of the exist have knowled of God so why would you debate atic or some or some onism who
(1:37:00) who doesn't have a position on the ex so agnostics can't have a neutral position about whether or not God exists or not
(1:37:06) you somebody a person who's agnostic you wouldn't listen in the debate on whether or not God is real or not they would say
(1:37:11) oh well I can't have information about the existence of God you go okay well I guess you wouldn't have this well then I guess 50% of the debates on modern day
(1:37:17) debate are incorrect because people have a neutral position an agnostic position like Matt dillah Hunty a guy you talk to
(1:37:23) about whether whether or not God is real where Matt dillah Hunty says listen I'm agnostic on it he could be real you just
(1:37:28) haven't demonstrated to me that he's real Matt dillah Hun's wrong in all of those debates right Destiny he would be if that was the prompt of the debate
(1:37:34) yeah so the prompt of the debate was is God real or not real triang I'm doing the triangle come in you go oh well I'm
(1:37:40) agnostic then you go okay why the [ __ ] are you in this debate you don't have a position on it then then bring in somebody that feels an atheist who wants
(1:37:46) to have a strong position of like he's not real or and then a the has to has a position a position he is real that makes no sense you can still have a
(1:37:52) neutral position that's that's absurd I don't know how how in the world are you the world's best leftist debater if you
(1:37:57) don't know you can take a neutral position this is like saying you want have a debate between two people between who is God or what is God and one person
(1:38:03) is Catholic and the other person is an atheist it's a nonsense position everybody knows this this is like a debate game oh everybody knows it true
(1:38:08) game yeah just like everybody knows it's an Insurrection even though they can't charge anybody every I the historical
(1:38:13) record say it's an Insurrection but uhuh okay um so what I'll do here is uh we'll move to the next caller here let's um Mo
(1:38:21) You Got It Up 5 five 84 you're up 5584 you're up all right welcome to the show
(1:38:27) 5584 you got Mar Gaines Destiny and Andrew and Wilson in the house hit us
(1:38:32) with your question please quickly because we got a lot of people on the line holy [ __ ] hello yeah go ahead bro you're on
(1:38:38) air can you hear me yeah we can hear you man you're on the air oh oh
(1:38:45) hello little nervous so um I just wanted to ask do I have to solely debate on this topic alone or can I just talk
(1:38:51) about other topics as well um we you want to keep a topic specific yeah because otherwise people are gonna be
(1:38:56) calling up for every yeah this is this is whole I mean
(1:39:02) neither of them actually gave a definition nether them gave a definition on the topic at all like Destiny what
(1:39:07) was your definition of uh if of insurrection uh an Insurrection has four
(1:39:12) crucial elements one is that there's an assembly of people for a common purpose two is that you are resisting a particular law or you're interfering
(1:39:18) with the course of government receding three is that you're doing this by way of force or intimidation and then four is you're doing it uh for a public
(1:39:24) purpose not like a private one you're not showing up to like steal something or you're not showing up because you're like upset about like a how a sporting
(1:39:30) event turned out there like a public interest in it damn yeah caller he said that at the top
(1:39:37) of his argument caller he said that at the top of his argument dude and he was
(1:39:43) referencing the 14th Amendment you might have missed no I'm just saying no I agree with him that it was Insurrection
(1:39:48) but isn't wasn't Andrew's whole point that January 6 was not Insurrection I believe that was his whole point well
(1:39:53) Andrew doesn't have a point because he doesn't he rejects my definition of insurrection and then he appeals to some Universal definition of Riot which I'm
(1:39:59) not even sure he's given and then he appeals to well this is what everybody would think a right is and then he appeals to it well nobody would agree that hippie people engaged in your
(1:40:05) definition of insurrection or committing an Insurrection so I guess Andrew's just agnostic on the question of whether or
(1:40:11) not j6 was an Insurrection because he doesn't have a definition of what an Insurrection is okay but I think you answered his question Destiny so we can
(1:40:16) move on to the next guy uh yeah all right brother thank you for calling in uh we're going to move on to the next
(1:40:22) caller again guys uh 515 605 9740 shout out to Mo and bills Manning the phone
(1:40:27) lines in the back uh if you super chat in the last four digits of your number fnf super chat.com uh we will go ahead
(1:40:33) or Rumble R whatever you want to do we're live on all the platforms we will get you to the top of the list for last four D of your number who's up next 486
(1:40:41) you're up 486 go ahead 486 shout out to the production team in the back man making this [ __ ]
(1:40:47) Flawless go ahead bro yeah hello can you can you hear me yes welcome to the show
(1:40:52) yeah I got a question for Andrew just uh that's not I'm not trying to debate on it's just a question I'm just trying to
(1:40:58) gauge what you think about this so Andrew uh if you if there was like a a leader or whatever per se of the country
(1:41:05) or whatever right like and you genuinely thought like genuinely wholeheartedly
(1:41:11) believe that this leader was like an evil person or whatever and they're going to bring Reign and Terror to your
(1:41:16) country or whatever do you like do you think it's morally Justified to take him out before he causes harm I and that's
(1:41:23) really context specific so I'm possibly like they possibly you believe
(1:41:31) that this like this leader was like the next Hitler or whatever you jally thought that do you think it's like okay to like kind of take over or like uh or
(1:41:38) like again that claim is it's really listen listen that claim is really
(1:41:44) context specific I'm going to tell you it's possible yes but I'm not sure
(1:41:50) because it would be under some type of again it's a like a nebulous concept the context behind this so I'm not sure
(1:41:57) maybe it could be there's a possibility but that doesn't mean yes or no I'm not
(1:42:03) sure I would need context for this okay so I mean just take the Trump
(1:42:08) shooting for example okay right so I mean like yeah
(1:42:14) suppose that guy that did it or whatever legitimately thought that like Trump was going to be the next Hitler do you think
(1:42:20) he like he was in the like like almost the right or whatever to try to take him out
(1:42:27) no okay why well so uh we're not allowed to In
(1:42:35) This Nation assassinate our political opposition and if you want to know why
(1:42:40) that would be immoral it's because that would be murder but if you want to know why that would be illegal it's because there's a crime against you know uh
(1:42:47) killing people that that's why it would be illegal it's it's a crime you can't kill people okay that that that's that's
(1:42:53) fine so let's just take just to be clear I don't think assassinations are allowed in any country I think usually not okay
(1:42:59) but okay I just want to ask do you think it's okay to just stop them just stop them from taking office like just like
(1:43:06) physically force and prevent them from taking office um I mean I I'm I'm trying to
(1:43:13) follow this may maybe it could be but but what do you mean you mean is it okay to physically stop Trump from taking
(1:43:20) office a bunch of people pul like if a bunch of people pulled up and just like forcibly physically we're say like we're
(1:43:26) not going to allow you to be president because we think you're going to be awful do you think it's okay to do that
(1:43:31) yeah that would be that would be criminal yeah you can't do that no okay all right uh that's it thank you
(1:43:40) no problem man uh we'll move on to the next caller again 515 605 9740 uh Super Chat last four digit of number to cut
(1:43:46) the line uh go ahead Mo 3990 3990 you're
(1:43:51) up go ahead 3990 hello everyone can you guys hear me
(1:43:59) yes okay Andrew I have a question can you define me a
(1:44:05) chair uh do you want well it depends on this is like the sandwich argument right
(1:44:11) uh so what is a sandwich what is a chair this kind of thing uh so when you look
(1:44:17) at the essence of a thing right it is possible that all definitions could fall short to an essence of a thing but that
(1:44:23) doesn't mean we can't recognize the essence of a thing why if we were to take the idea of um you know a bunch of
(1:44:30) hippies smoking a [ __ ] blunt in a forest somewhere to resist federal law and then they started burning the forest
(1:44:35) down uh because you know a couple of them got too rowdy calling that an Insurrection wouldn't fit the spirit of
(1:44:41) what that means so while you're looking at both the definition you're also looking at the application so when you
(1:44:48) ask can I define a chair sure can I give you a definition of a chair which you can't pick apart uh likely
(1:44:57) not but isn't that what you're doing right now no it's not what I'm doing right
(1:45:03) now because there's still an Essence to the thing there's still there's still something which we're perceiving to the
(1:45:09) thing which makes it a chair the same way it makes it an Insurrection so it f
(1:45:14) if it fits a Criterion of a riot better and when we see it as a riot and everybody sees it as a riot more than
(1:45:20) they do in Insurrection which why it was charged that way it seems like it falls under Riot better who is charged for a riot well
(1:45:28) they're Char charged under uh the purview of riting I thought they were Char for like trespassing and stuff yeah
(1:45:34) well trespassing as well so these arei well these are going to be tangential laws uh a tangential law what does that
(1:45:41) mean so so if you're if let's say for a second that you're arrested for um I don't know for trespassing right
(1:45:48) certainly that's not going to fit the definition of an Insurrection right is
(1:45:53) there wa is there a federal crime is there a federal crime for rioting well maybe not but it would be
(1:45:59) under purview of what rioting is I don't know what that means perview of what rioting is when we talk about criminal charges I don't know what that means
(1:46:06) okay well you agree with me there is rioting I don't know if rioting is a public or is a federal crime I'm not
(1:46:11) sure yeah I okay I get that but do you agree with me there is rioting I agree that riots exist yeah yeah and do you
(1:46:18) agree that you and I could likely agree on what a riot is uh I don't know you don't want to give to definition for
(1:46:23) anything well I mean if I gave you examples do you think we could agree like um if I showed BLM footage with of
(1:46:29) their riots do you think that you would agree that those were riots no I would ask you very specifically was anybody charged with a riot and if they weren't
(1:46:35) then I would say that by your earlier definitions of insurrection these must not have been riots show me somebody charged with CRI definition did I give
(1:46:41) you of insurrection you made it sound like a necessary element of an Insurrection having occurred was an individual being charged with a crime of insurrection you repeated this like 20
(1:46:47) times that never that never happened then why did you bring that up over and over and over again because well no so you're taking you're conflating two
(1:46:53) different ideas so idea one is nobody was charged with an Insurrection which
(1:46:59) means the powers at be also when they saw this under their purview probably didn't think that it fit the criteria
(1:47:05) for whatever an Insurrection is going to be and so that's we have to untangle this idea and then we move on to idea
(1:47:12) two which is your definition may fit something else better that it fits
(1:47:18) actual Insurrection okay then you'd have to show me for a particular BLM Riot that somebody was charged with the crime of
(1:47:24) rioting and if they weren't charged with that they were chared with something else I'd say oh people probably didn't think there was a RI they just like a for me how this was actually an
(1:47:30) Insurrection I already H I laid out four necessary elements that things that don't wouldn't Encompass a riot and okay
(1:47:35) well I would say that Chaz and chop was uh was like a open Rebellion or
(1:47:40) Insurrection I would ask you no because I would ask you for a single historical example um either judicially legally or
(1:47:46) through um any kind of like historical writing where where they say where they say that you can engage in an Insurrection against a state I'm not
(1:47:51) aware of that being possible I don't think interraction is defined for States but if you can show me an example then I say okay fine then Chaz was an interraction yeah okay but but the
(1:48:00) definition itself itself right if I were to Define it that way right as like Chaz
(1:48:06) chop and I'm not right but I'm saying I can at least look at that and say this is something akin to this of what I
(1:48:11) would expect to see under the criteria of X Y and Z that's my
(1:48:17) point maybe but you never gave me a definition for Insurrection so I'm not sure
(1:48:23) I mean it's good thing that Andrew doesn't think there are no rides during the BLM protest because no one got
(1:48:29) convicted so that's a good take I guess but thank you guys that's
(1:48:38) it all right so we'll move to the next caller so guys I'll just discuss with my team how we'll do it we'll answer a few more phone calls here and then what I'll
(1:48:44) do is we'll stay Live on YouTube and all the other platforms as you guys know obviously go check out Destiny go check out Andrew Wilson on their respective
(1:48:50) YouTube channels they're streaming as well this is you know multistream between all the different platforms I think between all of us guys we got like
(1:48:56) 50,000 plus around 30 to 50,000 watching us um and what I'll do is I'll send a
(1:49:01) zoom link to all the castle club members and we'll answer questions exclusively with the castle club members and I appreciate you guys doing that for me uh
(1:49:08) but we'll answer a few more phone calls for guys that are just watching the show regularly but we'll stay on but we'll answer questions from Castle club members only but uh but we'll do that in
(1:49:15) a bit after we answer some more here um who's next on the line we'll try to get through as many of you guys on one good
(1:49:20) 1143 you are up one 4 three you are up and before we bring him on uh Destiny uh
(1:49:26) Andrew do you guys want it where he just asked a question then we just move on uh then take him off the line you answer the question and go on so we get more
(1:49:32) people through you guys I what however you want to do it bro okay because I know you normally do this on your thing that should that would be better is how
(1:49:38) the caller say what they say and then disconnect them otherwise it's like a back and forth that could last forever yeah we'll do that then so uh caller go
(1:49:43) ahead uh say say your name where you're from ask a question and then we'll uh you know have them respond to your
(1:49:48) question and move on get as many people through 1143 ahead go ahead brother um
(1:49:55) all right I'll remain unnamed um but I just want to point out
(1:50:00) that the uh the particular government proceedings that BLM as a movement was
(1:50:07) uh interfering with were the various court cases related to pre police
(1:50:14) brutality um so okay BLM meet the criteria of an
(1:50:21) insurrection you wouldn't I'm I wouldn't Define like an entirety of a like a a summer of
(1:50:28) protests or riots or inters as like a particular Insurrection um also I don't think that I'll I'll just I'll I'll
(1:50:34) ignore the federal state distinction what one entity sure but like if we look
(1:50:41) consistently as BLM through the whole summer do what say that again and they Pro they profess
(1:50:49) themselves in favor of a certain type of outcome in various court cases relating
(1:50:54) to police brutality and demanded forcefully with intimidation that the government B to what they wanted the
(1:51:01) outcome to be how does this not make uh BLM an
(1:51:07) Insurrection if you can you might there my guess is going to be that if we went through every single like BLM Riot that
(1:51:14) we could probably find some that I would say might meet my definition if we ignore the state federal distinction we might find some that meet my definition
(1:51:20) of insurrection and that Trump is the president because he led in his Direction then Camala Harris uh directly
(1:51:28) uh provided Aid and support to insurrectionist so wouldn't this also make Kamala Harris an insurrectionist no
(1:51:35) because I don't think any court has reviewed any of that behavior and found any of it to be an Insurrection number one and number two I don't believe that
(1:51:42) providing bail money consider is considered part of aiding who whoa whoa whoa no court has said that this is an
(1:51:49) Insurrection either that's not true the Colorado state supreme court did why weren't why wasn't anybody charged
(1:51:55) then Destiny with Insurrection because it wasn't reviewing because the court wasn't reviewing it for a criminal proceeding it was the Colorado state
(1:52:01) supreme court they don't have the authority or jurisdiction to hear Supreme Court said the Supreme Court said that they didn't really want to
(1:52:07) deal with it so they basically asked it right so we're just operating off of your definition under your definition
(1:52:13) he's meeting the criteria for these being insurrections because he's saying that this is now Federal that these are
(1:52:18) impeding and resisting federal laws at this point and so if that is the case
(1:52:23) resis federal laws that's just you haven't demonstrated that the federal execution of what law well well wait a
(1:52:29) second weren't they resisting the federal laws of how police are able to
(1:52:34) deal with uh with suspects and things like this were they was it what police
(1:52:40) reform was was a federal law that's not none of none of that is federal but you I don't think you understand I mean
(1:52:45) that's what the caller saying though um no it sounded like he was saying uh they were protesting particular court outcomes that's the judicial system not
(1:52:52) the legislative system so I understand that government is confusing but these are two totally different things um I
(1:52:58) don't know if you can have an Insurrection protesting Court decisions I'm not aware of that ever being the
(1:53:03) case uh if you can engage in insurrectional Rebellion against a court decision I'm not I'm not aware of
(1:53:09) that all right uh we will go on to the next caller uh who's up next and we'll take a few more of these guys then I'm
(1:53:15) going to drop a link in Castle club for cast club members to come in and ask these questions 7579 you are up 757
(1:53:22) n you are up go ahead brother hey what's up y'all y'all hear me got
(1:53:28) you hey uh I got a question for Destiny and I think uh Andrew can pick up off afterwards uh So based off of your four
(1:53:37) points that you gave for what would make an Insurrection uh technically none of your
(1:53:43) points make it necessary for there to be violence you you say in point three
(1:53:48) force or intimidation but it doesn't necessarily have to be violence So based off of that wouldn't any legal protest
(1:53:57) where you're advocating for a certain uh political cause or anything like that in a public space wouldn't that also by
(1:54:03) your definition count as an Insurrection no because I think that the intimidation part is important the quote that I
(1:54:09) borrowed from here was from Justice Marshall in 1807 he said quote the most comprehensive definition of leving war
(1:54:15) against the king or against the United States which I have seen requires an assemblage of men ready to act and with
(1:54:20) an intent to do some treasonable Act and armed in warlike manner or else assembled in such numbers as to
(1:54:27) supersede the necessity of arms so I don't think you necessarily have to engage in violence but I think that
(1:54:32) having the people there um with the purpose of like intimidation and being ready to act with violence I think is a
(1:54:37) is is easily enough to satisfy Elementary no justice no like no justice no peace you you would have to point to
(1:54:44) like a you would have to point to a particular thing that I'll point to Chaz chop so do you think that if you were to
(1:54:50) take over a big portion or even a small tiny portion of a state and consider it to now be neutral from the United States
(1:54:57) itself that that becomes a federal matter um I don't know is that what was it considered a federal matter well
(1:55:04) don't you think that that is resisting federal law if you make the claim we are seceding this area from the United
(1:55:10) States how would that not be Federal were they seceding it from the United States or were they seceding or were they seceding it from uh Washington or
(1:55:18) whatever what were they seceding from the United States of America or were they sueding from like the state or the
(1:55:24) city so they no longer accepted USD they no longer employed or recognized like inter travel if you were to have a
(1:55:31) sucession or a secession that that would mean you couldn't accept USD anymore okay I don't don't why would
(1:55:38) that why would that matter because well it seems like if you're going to secede from a country it feels like part of that would be like establishing your own
(1:55:43) government establishing your own like Foreign Relations still you can still have USD and they did they did they were trying to do that they had their own
(1:55:50) armed militant group who was there armed definitely intimidating refused to allow people to come in and out of the zone
(1:55:56) They had they were trying to start their own economy their own Gardens they had annexed the buildings which were around them that definitely seems like they're
(1:56:02) resisting federal law you're not allowed to secede in the United States that is a that's a big no no I don't I don't
(1:56:09) remember this being can you tell me what statements or what they made I don't know the details of this what did they make or what statements did they make
(1:56:14) about Federal secession yeah so Chaz chop they considered it the neutral zone
(1:56:19) there was multiple statements made that this is no part of the United States by who we are taking this over just by the
(1:56:25) people who were there by the people so if a random person says a particular thing that be I thought you said earlier that we couldn't read intent into the
(1:56:32) Donald Trump crd you said earlier that we couldn't read intent into the Donald Trump crowd despite the fact that people were hanging signs saying 776 hang Mike
(1:56:39) Pence and the statement that Trump had made but I can ascertain but but you say but you say such an inference is fine so
(1:56:44) I didn't I said the inference is fine because of the col statements that Donald Trump had made collecting the people there for a given purpose that
(1:56:49) they actually managed to succeed in doing it makes perfect sense I can lay it out talking over me before I can make the point doesn't help your point no it
(1:56:56) actually doesn't make any sense because your claim is that you can read into the hearts and minds of these people based
(1:57:02) on what you perceive their actions to be it's like okay fair enough so if the people who are there are doing the exact
(1:57:08) same thing they're saying okay this is now a neutral zone we're seceding from the United States of America why can't we read that into their actions as well
(1:57:15) Destiny makes no sense I would absolutely do that if I I but I don't know of any statement like that and you can't name a single one so I don't know
(1:57:20) what I'm supposed to go I don't know what I can work off of if Chaz chop if there was such a statement let's just
(1:57:26) assume that there was for a second would you then consider that to be an
(1:57:32) Insurrection if they said that we are going to secede from the United States of America and they had like some organized violent wave and all the other
(1:57:38) elements were me that say yeah this would count as an Insurrection easy sure easily of course gotcha but you wouldn't say the same for
(1:57:45) January 6 so because you haven't even given a definition of insurrection but that's the difference between good faith and bad faith by the way no no no that's
(1:57:51) that's not bad faith for me to do an internal critique in your definition when I can at least take your definition
(1:57:57) and say wait a second all these apply to a different category that was established very well you're critiquing
(1:58:03) my definition without even having a definition of your own I don't need to have a definition critique yours that's absurd you're you no that's
(1:58:09) illogical the debate stop using illogical it doesn't mean anything you're one of the you're abusing the word okay the debate was whether or not
(1:58:17) the debate was over whether or not January 6th was an Insurrection if you only came to that debate to critique my
(1:58:23) position and I I shouldn't even let you get away this you said earlier that you were neutral on it you're not neutral on it the the answer for you is is you
(1:58:30) can't compute the question it's undefined you don't have a neutral position if you don't have a definition of insurrection you can't possibly take
(1:58:35) a it's like dividing by zero the answer is not neutral or nothing you just have an undefined position you have a
(1:58:40) definition of a term yeah I know you hate this that is true I don't like Aral that's actually an illogical statement
(1:58:46) to say that I would need to have a definition of anything to critique your definition of it if I have something
(1:58:53) else that I can make a comparison to that fits with better that you agree it fits better in okay can I ask you don't
(1:58:59) get that okay what would your position be on if I were to ask you is January
(1:59:04) 6 did what what the [ __ ] what's your what's your answer to that is January 6
(1:59:09) did you just go yeah if is I'm asking was January 6th a what's your answer to
(1:59:15) that would you say you neutral on that well that would be incoherent I wouldn't even understand what you're
(1:59:20) saying you I thank you I agree yes Insurrection that term is incoherent to you because you have no definition for
(1:59:25) the word so I'm uttering a I'm uttering nothing to you when I say Insurrection you have no way to compute the question
(1:59:30) so you can't say that you're neutral on it the same way you can't say you're neutral on it being you can't say you're neutral onction because you have no you
(1:59:36) have no definition for langage works then when you say this is a Snicker bar
(1:59:42) and I don't know what a Snicker bar is but I can't make comparisons to other things so that I can at least understand where you're coming from with what a
(1:59:47) Snicker bar is okay Destiny that's correct that is correct what if I showed you a bar you're like that's not a Snicker bar that looks like a chocolate
(1:59:53) wafy thing with caramel on it that's a Snicker bar thisit
(1:59:59) way a Milky Way that's actually way more like a Milky no it's not quite a Milky Way it's a Snicker bar you're like why I
(2:00:04) don't even have well then it would fit that criteria of a Snickers bar the ontology of a
(2:00:10) Snickers you don't have that ontology is not existent for you because it's undefined you have no definition of what
(2:00:15) a SN proba is you wouldn't need you don't need to have a definition understand an ontology of A New Concept what you talking about you
(2:00:23) can't that's crazy we're arguing over whether a thing is a thing whether whether a is B and for you B is
(2:00:30) undefined so you can't even be agnostic on the question you just you can't compute it it's it's gibberish to you like when I utter gibberish no this is
(2:00:36) gibberish to me this makes no sense why there's absolutely no reason why if you've never even if you you were to
(2:00:42) Grant I'd never even heard the term Insurrection before that I couldn't understand if you came up with a term
(2:00:47) for Insurrection I said well fit this other criteria better why it is that you couldn't concede that that was true that's this absurd logic and yes Destiny
(2:00:54) is illogical okay we can move to the next caller um I'll take a few more these
(2:01:00) that we're going to uh Castle club guys I'm going to send you guys a link on Castle Club where you can join in and uh be the people that ask these guys the
(2:01:06) questions and uh it'll be a good and don't worry we won't have your face on camera because we're streaming on all the platforms so we're going to protect
(2:01:12) your identity if you want to be on camera maybe we'll do that but in general we'll just have your voice play who's up next and whoever is 7983 I see
(2:01:20) you donated but you're not in the phone line so so okay 7893 get in there uh who's up next behind him 1753 you're up
(2:01:27) 1753 you're on the air with Destiny my and Andrew go
(2:01:34) ahead 1753 there you go what's up brother yes sir hello how are you guys doing good
(2:01:40) man what's your question for the panel question Qui quick question is a it's tangentially related but um uh Andrew
(2:01:48) why do you think Trump didn't call anybody uh during the riot like he had there were three hours cops had their
(2:01:55) [ __ ] kicked out of them he didn't call anybody except for well his lawyer and
(2:02:00) stuff but like like Nancy Pelosi that's usually the defense she was the high queen of all Capital Security why didn't
(2:02:06) Trump call Nancy Pelosi not within this is not within the purview of the this is not within the purview of the
(2:02:13) debate I don't care about your diet tribe I don't care about your emotional state this is not within the purview of the
(2:02:19) debate all right next up 8438 you are up
(2:02:25) 8438 you are up hey can you guys hear me go ahead
(2:02:31) brother I appreciate you having me I had a quick question for Destiny um it sounded like at the end of the debate
(2:02:37) toward the end he conceeded to Andrew's example of the hippie rebellion and hippie
(2:02:43) Insurrection um if that's the case then wouldn't you also have to say that the
(2:02:51) um the uh inauguration for Trump in 2017 the overturning of Rie Wade at the
(2:02:58) Supreme Court and the um I'm sorry go ahead nobody say
(2:03:05) anything yeah we're we're just listening caller yeah just listening to you bro go ahead wouldn't you have to say that
(2:03:12) those two events and then of course you have the the White House bombing after the George Floyd death with Trump and
(2:03:17) everything wouldn't you have to say that those would fall within the same definition as well
(2:03:22) I would have to go through the thxs of each of these but if you can show me that there was an assembly of people that United for a common purpose that
(2:03:28) they were there to contravene some type of federal law um that the resistance's
(2:03:34) goal was to make use of force or intimidation and that they were there for something that was like in the
(2:03:39) public interest then whatever you're going to give me here I'm going to say Well yeah if it's my definition of insurrection then I would say these were probably insurrections
(2:03:46) sure all right thanks also wait hold on real quick not only I say that you
(2:03:53) should say that too let's say for instance let's say that when roie Wade changed or whatever let's say the federal government was going to do a
(2:03:59) particular thing they were gathering to let's just say they were doing a ban on it let's say that you had uh let's say
(2:04:04) that KLA Harris was marching with these people chanting and cheering them on and saying like we're going to stop the
(2:04:10) government from Banning abortion okay they're going to sign this law today we're not going to let them do it we're going to make our vo here we're going to go and fight like how we're going to do
(2:04:16) what we need to do to make them not pass this law they show up when it's going to be signed she's outside cheering them on as they break into the capital building
(2:04:21) they go in when we talk about whether an Insurrection is occurring or not right and we talk about the 14th Amendment you
(2:04:27) shouldn't want her to be president again you should say Hey you took an oath to the Constitution and now you're engaging
(2:04:34) in Insurrection insurrectionist Behavior you you're you're violating your oath to the Constitution I don't want you
(2:04:39) running for office again we should all think that I would think that all of us should have that feeling that if somebody has engaged in or aided in uh
(2:04:46) uh helping people engage in Insurrection then you shouldn't want this person who was in office to run for office again I would say
(2:04:54) all right we'll move on to the next caller and guys just so you know we're going to drop the castle Club link uh sorry the zoom call Link in Castle Club
(2:05:00) right now so get in there and then raise your hand in the zoom call and we'll answer one or two more calls and we'll go over to Castle club guys only but
(2:05:07) we're going to drop the link right now cast club guys go ahead and join cast club.tv you know how to support uh you know free speech on our side and uh but
(2:05:13) we'll take a few more callers while we get that set up on our Zoom side uh who's up next Mo
(2:05:18) 4849 okay 4849 484 you're on there with Destiny Minon and Andrew what is your
(2:05:24) question brother hey can you can you he me yes welcome to the show all right cool uh so we were this
(2:05:32) whole debate was over a definition of is was this event the thing of insurrection
(2:05:38) so if you were to pick something like we'll say there's a shape and we were going to debate whether this shape was a
(2:05:44) square or not um Andrew's argument seems to be that oh
(2:05:50) well that that maybe fits the definition of a rhombus
(2:05:56) or a parallelogram better and that the basically those definitions are mutually
(2:06:03) exclusive I think that a lot of people would agree that the January 6
(2:06:11) event does fall under the definition of a riot that doesn't necessarily mean that it also wasn't an Insurrection
(2:06:17) there's so if you say oh hey this shape well it has four sides and each four
(2:06:24) side each of the four sides is parallel and say well oh well that's that's a rhombus or that's parallelogram that's
(2:06:31) not actually a square then like okay but you haven't said what a square is and
(2:06:38) Destiny is put forth not just a personal definition but the legal definition
(2:06:45) that's agreed on to by lots of Courts and that's how we do laws you know we we
(2:06:51) use Court's opinions to figure out whether this is a like falls under the Court's
(2:06:59) like the federal definition of what everybody agrees that is and so the saying oh well I don't have to Define
(2:07:06) what a square is if it's a my definition of a rhombus fine then I see I don't I
(2:07:14) don't see what we're what we're what we're arguing because it seems like Andrew
(2:07:31) within that def definition so you you cut you cut out caller but he doesn't
(2:07:36) like to Bro hang on hang on you you cut out like I I me and Destiny both missed like uh maybe 15 seconds
(2:07:45) there oh sorry uh do you know where where it was that it stopped um just
(2:07:51) saying that the definition of Riot and Insurrection is not mutually exclusive and so that just because he
(2:07:58) says that oh this fits my person personal definition of a riot does not
(2:08:04) necessarily mean that it's also not an Insurrection and the fact that they were trying to prevent some function of the government
(2:08:11) from happening some law from being um followed or carried out by the US
(2:08:16) government that that's the that's the defining Factor that's the thing that
(2:08:23) makes it an Insurrection and we can say that it was a riot cool but it was also an
(2:08:30) Insurrection okay anything else oh would you would you say and this
(2:08:38) is this is why I'm saying that you need to have some sort of way of saying this
(2:08:44) is not an Insurrection other than saying this is right yeah we've already been
(2:08:49) over this though multiple times I know you don't understand the argument but that doesn't mean it wasn't made why it
(2:08:54) isn't yeah it's not it's not so so I I don't think you understand what the I don't think you understand what the
(2:09:00) burden of proof is okay I I never have to tell you why the thing that it's not
(2:09:06) an inter why don't dude if you're just gonna cut me off and not let me answer then we're not gonna have a productive
(2:09:11) combo go ahead let him make his point go go ahead who's the burden of proof on here it's on both of us no it's not
(2:09:19) who's a burden of proof on
(2:09:25) well if the burden of proof to say that it's not an Insurrection is on the person who's claim no no it's not my
(2:09:31) burden to say it's not it's not my burden to say that it is the burden the burden of proof is on the person who
(2:09:37) makes the claim not for me to negate said claim but for them to prove it
(2:09:44) that's the distinction do you understand that you say you have no claim that it's not an you're not right no no no answer
(2:09:50) my question do I need to negate a claim for you to be able to prove it can't you prove a
(2:09:59) claim well if you're if you're answer my question dude it categorically does not
(2:10:05) fit the ter know you're not answering the question right direction all
(2:10:10) right all right whatever you say bro I know you don't want to answer it's it's fine so all right uh we'll go to next
(2:10:17) caller and uh just just as a real quick thing so like the the the prompt was was January 6th in Insurrection debating my
(2:10:23) definition of insurrection doesn't satisfy the prompt it only satisfies attacking my position but even if you
(2:10:29) did manage to completely defeat my position not by actually showing because you're not even really defeating my
(2:10:35) position you're just making my position incoherent but by doing so you're also admitting that your position is incoherent as well right if you can
(2:10:41) prove that I don't have a good definition for if you can prove that I don't have a good definition for Insurrection then you can prove that my position saying it
(2:10:47) is an Insurrection is incoherent I would have to use some other word you Haven even given a position at all so put us both at neutral which is kind do you
(2:10:53) remember do you remember in the beginning of the debate where I gave you the criteria for the concessions that I would make if you were willing to
(2:10:59) concede on XYZ Point uh yeah but that but we're not
(2:11:04) here to just argue does destiny have a and we both but if if if I have if I
(2:11:12) have no negation but we end up on neutral because uh your definition is incoherent then do you remember when I
(2:11:17) said in my opening statement that the goal of that was to show that you know longer have the moral High Ground cuz
(2:11:22) everything's a [ __ ] Insurrection at that point and that means you're as much of an insurrectionist as the people you're accusing of being insurrectionist
(2:11:28) that's clear that wouldn't make everything an Insurrection that would just make all riots an Insurrection yeah I was being hyperbolic okay well that's
(2:11:35) kind of hard when you're also being illogical um but the idea um yeah all you're doing is producing us both to the
(2:11:40) same position which seems odd at the end of the day but okay why depends on what the goal of the debate is in this
(2:11:46) particular was to show that both of us are neutral on whether January 6 was an Insurrection you know that you don't actually believe that
(2:11:51) if you're neutral if you're neutral on whether or not January 6 is an Insurrection your claim is voided but then so would yours be unless
(2:11:58) your claim is what claim am I making my claim is only that you're a challenger
(2:12:05) if I say if I say that January 6 was an Insurrection you wanted to challenge that position generally the challenge would be that January 6th wasn't an
(2:12:11) Insurrection not that not that January 6 not that January 6 doesn't comport with Destiny's definition of insurrection or
(2:12:17) I think's des's definition of insurrection is incoherent that's a different debate well no I don't I don't think it's a different kind of debate
(2:12:24) and saying loaded things like well generally this means doesn't mean anything so ultimately if I can if I can
(2:12:31) reduce this if I can reduce this to a neutral position then your claim that this was an Insurrection is false okay
(2:12:36) but then your claim that it wasn't an Insurrection is also false I never made such a claim what is your claim your
(2:12:41) claim is just that you're neutral you have no position on it my claim was that I could be swayed either way that but
(2:12:47) that's not what the debate the debate wasn't here to sway you well no you can't be convinced because you can't accepted definition of insurrection
(2:12:52) that's just not true well I can be convinced and you just saying you can't be convinced doesn't mean anything again
(2:12:57) so you are you unconvinced by historical courts that have convicted people or Ed these definitions of insurrection in
(2:13:03) order to in order to write legislation or in order to write Constitutional Amendments what do you think the founding fathers meant not founding
(2:13:09) fathers I guess what do you think the framers of section three of the 14th Amendment meant when they said Insurrection what do you think I think that they're tying it to Rebellion why
(2:13:17) but they very clearly because every time every time I saw it it seemed to coexist with Rebellion every single time I see
(2:13:23) this it seems like it's a lead towards Rebellion if you agree that it um if you
(2:13:29) agree that it meant Rebellion why would there be so many people that um draw
(2:13:34) distinctions between Insurrection and Rebellion but yeah until it comes to charging time when it comes to charging
(2:13:40) time it seems that if they can't draw it hold on why do just because you're talking about charges criminal court and
(2:13:45) calling a thing to if you're going to appeal to authorities here based around legal legal definitions is perfectly
(2:13:53) acceptable for me to appeal to the legal authorities which are refusing to charge under this criteria Destiny they're
(2:13:59) refusing to charge under this criteria for Insurrection and it seems every definition that I can find for this is
(2:14:06) somehow vaguely associated with Rebellion uh yeah it's associated with
(2:14:12) it because I believed in every Rebellion started with an Insurrection but that doesn't mean that every Rebellion is an Insurrection that's why they Rebellion
(2:14:20) or insurrection SE of the second confiscation act you can't give any hisorical things though
(2:14:25) so for they say in any Rebellion or Insurrection inciting and setting foot on assisting or engaging in any
(2:14:30) Rebellion or Insurrection which is set under section two of the second confiscation confiscation act um they're
(2:14:35) not that's they're two different things that's why they use but the reason that I think that the court the Supreme Court especially didn't want to hear this is
(2:14:41) because they would end up like you giving a definition which was so broad that would Encompass all sorts of things
(2:14:47) that we don't really perceive of as being insurrections because we really associate Insurrection and Rebellion
(2:14:53) with the same kind of idea which is exactly why I don't believe for a second while you're over there saying you're
(2:14:58) good faith that you believe for a second that if a bunch of dope smoking hippies to you know kind of resist federal law
(2:15:05) went and smoked a bunch of joints on federal property and a couple of them got Rowdy you would believe that that
(2:15:10) was an Insurrection I don't believe you I simply a bunch of people smoking weed went and started setting fire to forests
(2:15:15) in the United States America on federal property because they were trying to get them to over couple of them did they started a small fire let's say right not
(2:15:22) not a huge blazing forest fire just started a small fire there was a little bit of rioting there right somebody got
(2:15:28) beat up couple of them had uh maybe some melee weapons I don't think we would associate that with rebellion and so I
(2:15:35) don't think we would associate that with Insurrection what I think we associate with Rebellion I'm sorry because I don't know the logical structures of
(2:15:40) argumentation as well as you do when you say people probably wouldn't do that what kind of an argument are we making there when you say that like people
(2:15:46) probably wouldn't think that's an Insurrection what what kind of logical appeal are we making to challenge my definition the people probably wouldn't
(2:15:53) think AAL what is that yeah what structure we so hang on so we'll unang again we're going to untangle two
(2:15:58) different ideas so I already gave you the critique of your definition when you ask me what you Andrew what do you
(2:16:06) associate with this thing which is your direct question what what types of things do you associate with this I tell
(2:16:12) you then I say if that's the type of thing that I associate with it I also think most people associate that type of
(2:16:18) thing with it as well so these are two different IDE most I'm looking at the anding it right so in the Amy War priz
(2:16:26) case the Supreme Court said Insurrection against a government may or may not culminate in an organized Rebellion but
(2:16:32) a civil war always Begins by Insurrection against the lawful authority of the government a rebell war did not did not begin the Civil War
(2:16:39) didn't begin with an Insurrection a Civil War did not begin because of j6 that it says Insurrection against the
(2:16:47) government may or may not culminate in an organized Rebellion that's correct so it could so there was an Insurrection
(2:16:52) against the government it didn't culminate in a rebellion but those are two different things and I can show you Supreme Court cases where they said
(2:16:58) different things so your idea he of well they probably thought they were the same unfortunately is too nebulous here for
(2:17:03) us to associate this specifically with only the idea of insurrection when there's other ideas that fit it better
(2:17:09) is there a single historical scholar Supreme Court case uh writer or framer or lawmaker ever that you can site to
(2:17:16) that says that there is a nebulous there's no understanding of what Insurrection is well actually yes so the
(2:17:21) Supreme Court Justices themselves have stated this I do have a quote from one of the Supreme Court Justices who said
(2:17:27) this is not an easy thing to tackle because the idea of it is contested in somewhat nebulous I believe in fact that
(2:17:35) that was Justice now I'm paraphrasing but I believe that that was Justice Roberts who said that and what was the
(2:17:41) what was the full quote here I would have to pull the quote up so I'm paraphrasing right but it was
(2:17:47) something akin to this idea is actually it's a hard associative idea this was
(2:17:52) from from Roberts himself the Supreme Court clearly did not want to weigh in on this because they were afraid of
(2:17:58) making a definition like your own which would be so broad are you disputing this let's start with this are you disputing
(2:18:04) that you think the Supreme Court didn't weigh in on this because they were afraid that they could make a definition
(2:18:09) of this which was so broad that things would fall under the category of insurrection that they really didn't
(2:18:14) want to fall under that category I don't think the Supreme Court made a strong statement about Insurrection yeah what do you think though what you actually
(2:18:21) think I they didn't they didn't really rule on the Insurrection part I know they didn't rule on it but why do you think they really didn't want to hear it
(2:18:27) why do you think it is that this is kind of such a hard concept uh for for people to kind of get their minds around it's
(2:18:34) because it is somewhat nebulous it is associated with rebellion and yes there's precedents for these things but
(2:18:40) the precedents don't directly apply to what j6 was it do matter the issue hang on hang on man let me finish my point
(2:18:47) and then you can respond other things do seem to associate with it better that's the point your definition is far too
(2:18:53) broad you knew it would be far too broad the Supreme Court also knows this that's why the Supreme Court themselves I think
(2:18:59) really didn't want to go in and rule on it because it would retroactively make a bunch of Democrats and Republicans
(2:19:04) insurrectionist based on other things that they have done that's great and that's a bunch of reading into that Supreme Court decision that they had
(2:19:10) never said but I'm pretty sure that the rationale that they gave in the issue was that different Minds could disagree
(2:19:15) on whether or not an instruction had taken place and the idea that different states would make different decisions about it um seem to be very difficult
(2:19:21) for them so in Barrett's so it's nebulous it's a little bit nebulous they can't really agree cuz it's kind of a
(2:19:27) nebulous concept right do you think that murder is a nebulous concept I think that justification for murder can be
(2:19:33) very nebulis you think that murder is a nebulous concept why you rambling question no let me I'm I asked you a
(2:19:38) question do you think murder is a nebulous concept answering the question do you think murder is a nebulous concept I'm trying to answer the question when youever you're ready to
(2:19:44) let me answer all right I'm going to repeat it when you're done rambling but okay well I'm not going to ramble I'm going to give you an actual direct
(2:19:49) answer certain aspects of murder when it comes to justification can be very nebulous yes like right to retreat laws
(2:19:54) can be very nebulous yes that can constitute murder it can be very nebulous we have some concept of it but
(2:20:00) it's not it's not really something which is easily graspable yes it can be very
(2:20:06) nebulous Destiny yes and yet we still have criminal convictions for murder
(2:20:11) that's true we do still have criminal convictions for murder which does not demonstrate your point at all it absolutely does if a court is capable of
(2:20:18) determining whether or not a person can have a they determine they determined that none
(2:20:24) of them committed Insurrection that's what they determined that's not what they determined what they determined what they determined really where in the
(2:20:30) Supreme Court they charge hang on what did they charge him with they charge the Supreme Court is not a is not a first uh
(2:20:36) a first review I'm talking about the Supreme Court I don't know what you're talking about then no one is I'm sorry where in the 14th Amendment does it say
(2:20:42) the crime of insurrection all you're doing is speed talking what I'm saying to you is when you ask me are certain aspects of murder nebulous yes of course
(2:20:48) certain aspects of murder are nebulous can people still be charged on those aspects yes can they be prosecuted yes
(2:20:53) but you say well then there you can prove it great I agree you can prove it and when these people were prosecuted
(2:20:59) they were not prosecuted for Insurrection so clearly they didn't think it was Insurrection or at least it
(2:21:05) seems like they didn't think it was Insurrection because they certainly didn't charge anybody with that gotcha just as a quick SPI or whatever because Andrew has no concept of how law or
(2:21:11) courts or anything works in the United States the 14th amendment has absolutely nothing to do with somebody being charged with the criminal conviction of
(2:21:17) insurrection criminal conviction of insurrection has nothing to do with any of this and the question before the Court in Trump V Anderson wasn't whether or not somebody had engaged in the crime
(2:21:23) of insurrection and the big issue that they cited to for why they rejected that case was because Section 5 of the 14th
(2:21:28) Amendment said that Congress can pass laws in order to implement something and they interpreted as meaning Section 3 could be implemented via the section
(2:21:34) five power of the Congress and that's why they threw that case out they didn't a r it's not a bait and switch it's just a basic understanding of how work but
(2:21:40) all I was saying all I was saying was that you saying well it's nebulous therefore a court can't decide that
(2:21:46) question courts deal with nebulous things literally all of the time the idea that a court deal with something that's nebulous like Insurrection Court
(2:21:52) deal with things like murder or affirmative defenses like self-defense or anything else is a ridiculous claim and it shows a fundamental understanding what courts are even supposed to do
(2:21:58) except that wasn't my claim so here's here's the great kind of Destiny bait and switch right he just did a typical bait and switch what he did was he said
(2:22:05) this he said Andrew do you think that a court can do a b and c or they they can uh in some way rule or adjudicate even
(2:22:11) with a nebulous concept my answer was yes I think that even with a nebulous concept they can in this case right uh
(2:22:19) even if we were to Grant Destiny's argument that they can do this under nebulous Concepts they still didn't
(2:22:25) charge these people with Insurrection even if that's a nebulous concept what he did instead was he did a bait and switch and said oh but he doesn't
(2:22:31) understand the law blah blah BL blah blah this was a lead in needed to be
(2:22:36) charged with let me finish my point I just let you go through your whole diet tribe Gish G so I went it's not a Gish Gallop
(2:22:43) it's a direct respon debunked argum you don't even know what a Gish Gallop is you're just you lay a whole bunch of bad Clans on over and over over
(2:22:51) ref them because you keep stacking the same you made the claim I'm refuting
(2:22:57) it a basic lead in and I Pro the basic lead in wrong and so that's when he went off on the diet tribe about well what
(2:23:04) the you know the court blah blah blah what about the courts what about the precedents well it had nothing to do with the actual lead in question which
(2:23:09) is what I was responding to That's a classic bait and switch you said that the Supreme Court didn't rule on the definition because it was too nebulous
(2:23:15) that's not true they rejected it you ask me why do you think the Supreme Court acts and so I just gave you my opinion I
(2:23:23) think possibly it's because this is a nebulous concept they didn't want to weigh in it seems that Roberts agreed
(2:23:28) when you read initially what Robert said it seems like that's what he's saying there is that there's going to be a lot
(2:23:33) of disagreement here because we can't quite agree on this that sounds nebulous to
(2:23:39) me all right how about this we'll take one more caller and then we'll go to the castle club guys let's get the guy on
(2:23:44) the line yes go ahead 0789 0789 go ahead hit the the line and
(2:23:50) then after him I actually do have a potential topic of discussion for the panel uh but let's get this caller on
(2:23:56) first go ahead 0789 you are up 0789 you are
(2:24:01) up hello hello can you guys hear me yes what's up brother awesome great uh Mr Wilson uh
(2:24:11) big fan absolute Cinema um and I have a question for uh Mr barelli um if uh I
(2:24:19) knew what sexual assault was but I had no [ __ ] clue what rape was could you
(2:24:24) ever prove to me that a rape took place because no because whatever definition you give whatever definition I give for
(2:24:31) rape you're just going to say it would fit with sexual assault yeah no true yeah if if you didn't if you had no idea what rape was but you knew well what
(2:24:37) sexual assault was then any single time I try to Define well I think a rape has occurred you would just say no I think this fits with sexual assault you would
(2:24:42) never give a definition of rape and then you would just use that to try to win the argument yeah
(2:24:51) you left I think you left okay uh yeah all right so uh we'll go ahead and start switching
(2:24:58) on over to the castle club members I'll hit a couple of these hands and then I do have something that I was going to bring up to the panel uh who's the first
(2:25:03) person on bills all right we're going to go ahead and just for the guys on cast club that are waiting we're not going to put you on camera because we're live on
(2:25:09) YouTube and all the platforms so I want to protect your guys identities um but we'll go ahead and get the first person
(2:25:14) in that had uh that had something bills do we have them ready look yeah yeah locals only yeah
(2:25:22) cast clubs yeah same thing yeah yeah oh no no no not for the
(2:25:27) stream damn Ah that's just confirming br oh yeah no
(2:25:33) I meant as in like it's fine uh go go ahead just um it's fine we'll get these
(2:25:40) because they're still live on their platform so it's cool okay it's whatever Chief rocker go ahead bro
(2:25:51) Chief Rocka going once going
(2:26:01) twice yeah damn guys I didn't want to get off YouTube [ __ ] guys come on man it's
(2:26:10) fine who's up next hey myON if you're going to if you're going to move this over to um to
(2:26:18) the castle club uh let me uh let me kill the stream on this end and then keep it up you keep it up that wasn't Our
(2:26:23) intention to kill our stream on our end okay do that yeah just just an error but
(2:26:29) you guys keep your stuff going on that's cool I just where the cast club members can ask questions go
(2:26:34) ahead hey so question Destiny would you say that this is would
(2:26:41) you say this is an organized attempt by a group of people to defeat their government and take control of their
(2:26:47) country usually by violence no I don't think for Insurrection I think that maybe that gets you to Rebellion but for
(2:26:54) an Insurrection it doesn't have to be an attempt to control the entire government it could just be to contravene a certain procedure official proceeding um or to
(2:27:00) resist the implementation of a particular law to resist like the execution of a law so not a violent attempt to take
(2:27:07) control of a government violence or intimidation of violence is a necessary element yes but not to control the entire
(2:27:14) government well three out of four dictionaries Define it as taking control of a government and then there's a
(2:27:20) looser definition that is just an act of revolting against civil Authority or
(2:27:26) established government but that's just a loose definition that's fine but we have a supreme court and we have a
(2:27:32) legislative history that I would refer to in this country before looking at how a dictionary would Define a particular thing um I don't think that at any time
(2:27:39) when you engage in statutory construction or legal review of a particular thing do you just open the dictionary and read the dictionary
(2:27:45) definition yeah but the the definitions come from a general understanding and since there was nothing legally pursued
(2:27:52) then I don't think the legal definition applies here the more it's think it's just the definition of what we
(2:27:57) understand something to be that's well even if you wanted to appeal to a dictionary definition you'd be appealing
(2:28:03) to dictionary definitions at the time that Insurrection was enshrined in constitutional uh Amendment that's what
(2:28:09) you'd be looking for and then number two there were things that were declared insurrections and there were people that were forgiven of like crimes of
(2:28:14) insurrection so there is a legislative and there is a Judicial history of understanding what that is
(2:28:21) okay thank you
(2:28:26) y so uh real quick uh so this is what we're going to do we're going to end the stream on our end you guys stay like you
(2:28:32) are we're going to continue running the show because you guys are live we're going to come back on YouTube because we did not mean to end our stream on
(2:28:38) YouTube and Rumble so we're going to restart it back up cast club members you guys are still going to goe and get your questions answered we'll still be running everything we're just going to
(2:28:43) end the stream on our end but we're still going to be live on zoom and everything else like that so nothing really changes we'll just fix some stuff
(2:28:49) on our back end but um let's get the next person on Castle Club um I apologize about that
(2:28:55) guys I did not mean to end our YouTube stream at all or that was a mistake that we made on our side uh so okay uh who's
(2:29:03) the next person on Castle Club let's get them on or even we could go back to pH lines if we need to yeah oh no no no we
(2:29:09) got we got Castle Club you got a castle Club guy all right let him ask this thing while we restart the
(2:29:14) stream go who's up next wait here okay go ahead real quick I have a
(2:29:21) question for you do you support the imprisonment of Americans without a
(2:29:26) trial um depends on what you mean by imprisonment like police officers are
(2:29:31) allowed to arrest you and hold you while you're pending a trial date I think there's like it's like 60 or 90 days or something is your uh constitutional
(2:29:38) rights or whatever I think that might vary from just from like state to state but in general no I'm opposed to be people being held without trial but
(2:29:44) there's also like the Patriot active stuff as well so I mean it would depend on the circumstance tell them all right that's good enough
(2:29:50) I in general I no I don't think people should be held without trial in general I think that's probably not good but I know there are specific circumstances
(2:29:56) where like again like pre-trial stuff you can be held for a while while you're a waiting formal charges and then for
(2:30:01) the Patriot Act if there are like matters of National Security they might be able to hold you without trial for some indefinite period I'm not sure if
(2:30:07) that applies to Citizens as well but all right who's uh who's up
(2:30:16) next okay Eric Richardson go ahead
(2:30:22) can you hear me go ahead brother go ahead all right so Destiny so if someone
(2:30:28) is protesting for or against a particular law that you know would directly affect them would would you
(2:30:35) agree that a protest is a type of political fight um yeah a type of political fight
(2:30:44) I guess that's a pretty like they're fight they're fighting for their rights right I guess sure yeah you can protest things yeah
(2:30:50) okay so if a fight doesn't necessarily need to be violent why then do you
(2:30:57) attribute Trump's words prior to January 6 as calling for violence when he didn't
(2:31:05) directly incite violence in his language I don't know if he directly incited
(2:31:10) violence I think that's a fundamentally different question I think that Donald Trump called people there on January 6th to protest the certification of the vote
(2:31:18) um because he led everybody to believe believe that that certification could be stopped either with Pence or with enough
(2:31:24) uh Force supplied I guess and as the Insurrection was on going Donald Trump was making calls to lawmakers to try to
(2:31:31) continue to encourage them to delay the certification of the vote so it seems
(2:31:36) like there was a there was a plan in mind the entire time it was even more extensive than that but yeah he was hoping that there would be a lot of
(2:31:42) pressure that's why he called people there on January 6th it's why he even when he knew they had guns and stuff he sent them to the capital to go and
(2:31:48) protest it's why he said over again stop the steal fight like hell to take our country back and it's why when violence started and he watched violence
(2:31:54) happening on TV and he heard that Ashley bab had been shot instead of like trying to call people off from being violent he
(2:31:59) tried to take advantage of the violence in order to further his scheme of having the vote not certified so all of that
(2:32:05) seems PR obious Direction yeah Pi picking up to what uh Andrew had said
(2:32:10) similar to that you know he to go he
(2:32:15) didn't uh like I said he didn't incite them to violence right he he was to fight yes fight for the election that he
(2:32:22) believes he was robbed from that doesn't necessarily mean that he was wanting a violent outcome and Andrew had pointed
(2:32:28) out that when the events did escalate to a violent nature he did tweet to be
(2:32:34) peaceful So to that point Trump's motivation in the events of that
(2:32:41) day isn't in line with an Insurrection he wasn't he wasn't trying to do an
(2:32:48) Insurrection he was just wanting a protest so here's like yeah so there's two different there's two different ways
(2:32:54) that is a different point yeah there's two different ways to look at this I think this is a very simple analysis I can't believe that there is uh I don't
(2:33:00) think reasonable Minds disagree here but if we were to look at a man who wanted a peaceful protest and you were to look at
(2:33:05) a man who didn't want a peaceful protest who wanted an Insurrection Donald Trump takes every single action of the man who
(2:33:12) wanted an Insurrection but didn't obviously want to be like legally charged for it by saying go and be violent right he called everybody there
(2:33:19) on a particular day he was already enacting a plot both in the background and publicly to pressure Pence to toss
(2:33:25) out the vote he was encouraging people to protest on the day saying stop the steal leading people to believe over
(2:33:30) months that the election had been stolen and when violence broke out on the capital grounds even after babbit was
(2:33:36) killed he was making phone calls to legislators to have them stall the electoral vote these are the actions of
(2:33:41) a man who wanted violence saw violence happening and everything was happening the way that he wanted except he didn't ultimately completely stall the vote if
(2:33:48) Donald Trump didn't want violence he either one probably wouldn't have called them there on the sixth that's obviously going to be a huge red flag two as soon
(2:33:54) as it got violent he would have made calls to the National Guard to figure out like hey what's going on can I get people down there three when multiple
(2:34:01) people were going into his office to ask him hey can you please tweet to get these people to [ __ ] off to stop he would have done it immediately instead
(2:34:07) of waiting until after Ashley bab was dead instead instead of waiting for hours of violence to rage on and four he
(2:34:12) would have said right at the very beginning at like at the very second anybody complained about anything he would have reminded people to like hey
(2:34:19) like either leave don't go in don't do this particular thing stop this now or go home instead of again waiting and and
(2:34:25) capitalizing on the Violence by making phone calls to people remember when McCarthy called him Donald Trump literally said sounds like these people are hell of a lot more mad than you are
(2:34:31) about this like this is a man who is taking advantage of the violence every step of the way you can't possibly look this guy and think man he really wanted
(2:34:37) them to be peaceful when he's taking advantage of the violence the whole time and doing nothing to stop it when it's easily within his power to do so so
(2:34:43) since you say then that you know he he essentially all but called for the Insurrection by by you know using his
(2:34:50) words carefully or you know however you want to say it that my my counter question to that would be how could
(2:34:56) someone in his position want to peacefully
(2:35:03) protest the the results of the election without you then saying it was an
(2:35:09) Insurrection being that it was the people at the site who ended up being
(2:35:14) violent not not because he called for it it just turned into that so how could Trump have otherwise for a peaceful
(2:35:20) protest without you saying it was an Insurrection well one is sending them to
(2:35:26) the place where the vote was being certified is already a huge red flag number one number two is you've spent
(2:35:33) really months um getting all these people to believe that the election was stolen with no evidence number three is
(2:35:38) you've used multiple parts of your government to engage in Lies over and over again about there being evidence of voter fraud which there wasn't and he
(2:35:45) knowingly lied about all of these things um and four there's probably never an
(2:35:50) appropriate way to protest the certification of the vote because at that point you're not protesting like
(2:35:55) voter fraud you're not protesting like a Court's decision you're you're literally protesting the certification of the
(2:36:01) election the electors already voted on the 14th of um December the election itself was already held on the third or
(2:36:08) third of November like at that point what are you protesting you're just protesting the the certification of the
(2:36:14) vote that the peaceful transfer of power
(2:36:22) okay love you all right who's up next and then uh
(2:36:28) I'll go to my topic that I was going to ask you guys because I just want to get shift the conversation a little bit make it more a little interesting James mcfar
(2:36:34) James McFarland go ahead and we're back I do myin I do have tonight um I do have
(2:36:40) a heart out at 11: oh [ __ ] uh Eastern Standard Time or uh yep Eastern Time yep
(2:36:46) oh [ __ ] so you got 10 minutes left yep okay no worries man that's it's fine we'll just finish answering these
(2:36:51) questions and then we'll try to speed through as many of them as we can all right y'all call me while I'm taking a dump but [ __ ] it um all right
(2:36:59) so just to give I'm G do a little statement in a question but uh my statement
(2:37:06) is I got to admit I personally like I [ __ ] with both Destiny and Andrew as far
(2:37:11) as both ends of the aisle rain like debating wise in the YouTube sphere I
(2:37:16) typically think Destiny has more intellectual valid points but throughout this little conversation y'all had I
(2:37:23) think Andrew bodied you and that's because of like he I mean that hippie
(2:37:28) statement bro if people are out all protesting they're billing every four of
(2:37:35) your things first dinner for your waistline sweet potato oh sorry about
(2:37:41) that on yeah I don't know as far as those four points are if they're all protesting for weed you're considering
(2:37:47) that an insurrection it's like if that's your definition then that an Insurrection what like all right who
(2:37:54) gives a [ __ ] about who's having an Insurrection like that [ __ ] is not as serious as you're trying to make it if
(2:37:59) it's as simple as something like that like I mean you might just maybe
(2:38:05) you don't think an Insurrection is a big deal that's fine but people probably shouldn't be gathering to violently try
(2:38:10) to overturn laws in this country we've got a process for it we've got be I knew
(2:38:15) that was going to be a rebuttal but so why are you trying to equate that with a group people smoking weed against a weed
(2:38:22) law like that I'm not I'm not equ I'm not the same don't don't make both of
(2:38:28) those insurrections I never made both of them the same but an Insurrection is an Insurrection I can show you examples of
(2:38:33) rape that are far more atrocious than other examples of rape that doesn't make one not rape like any crime can be done
(2:38:39) with more severity than another crime that doesn't make it not a crime it doesn't make it not a thing and a bunch of a bunch of people smoking weed
(2:38:45) against a weed law doesn't make them trying to overthrow the government I agree I don't think it does a bunch of people but if a bunch of people would
(2:38:51) you agree that if a bunch of people smoked weed and they all like decided they were going to show up and like break into Congress to try to prevent
(2:38:56) them from passing some like new law that wasn't the argument you made though the argument he made was a bunch of hippies
(2:39:02) did all four of those arguments you made and the one thing against the law that they were suppressing because I was
(2:39:08) going to say this too Andrew's argument against the suppression versus being illegally doing illegal activities doing
(2:39:14) a riot that was his stupid fault for his argument as well wait hold on to be clear Andrew didn't say they were just
(2:39:20) smoking Andrew said they were setting flest on fire no no I'm I'm not talking about that in general I'm talking about Andrew was talking about like oh they're
(2:39:27) committing they're committing crimes during their Riot or whatever and you were saying That's not them that's not
(2:39:33) them going against a law like I'm agreeing with both of you in both of what you're saying
(2:39:39) but in his in his specific argument when he said those people are trying to smoke
(2:39:45) weed I'm a little drunk right now too so my words is as coherent but when he saying they were going against smoking
(2:39:51) weed and it's a bunch of hippes getting together smoking weed you can't equate that to people overthrowing a government
(2:39:57) and say yeah that's Insurrection if if that's going with my definition yeah smoking weed wouldn't be an Insurrection
(2:40:03) a crowd of people smoking weed wouldn't be an Insurrection and even if it even if it covers all four of your bases that
(2:40:09) you were saying one of them is by force or intimidation in order to like overturn a law so they would have to be rioting they would have to be causing
(2:40:15) violence in order to get people to like they were doing that while smoking weed and they're their reason was smoking
(2:40:22) weed that that's an Insurrection if a bunch of people showed up at Capitol Hill and they said that we're going to engage in violent conduct because we
(2:40:28) disag Capital Hill why does have to be Capital Hill I mean it doesn't necessarily I'm just giving an example saying if they showed up anywhere it
(2:40:34) could be anywhere um and I am I'm I'm more of your fan I'm just sure I mean I
(2:40:40) guess it could be anywhere they engage somewhere and they wanted to go and do a whole like maybe it could be a state I don't know maybe it could be a [ __ ]
(2:40:45) neighborhood of like anti-pt smokers or whatever and they're like we're going to go here and we're going to start riding and burning houses down because we want
(2:40:51) to have the [ __ ] weed loss change it is [ __ ] that these [ __ ] like took weed from us and they engag in that behavior I'd say yeah that's an
(2:40:56) Insurrection you're you've got an assembly of people that are trying to use violence and then you're trying to change the laws um you know that are
(2:41:03) affecting publicly everybody like yeah that's an Insurrection you're
(2:41:09) Insurrection is not that serious in that case then no I think Insurrection is
(2:41:14) incredibly serious you don't want people thinking that they can get laws changed in the country by doing violent riot that's horrible so you don't think the
(2:41:20) definition of that should be changed or the word should be changed for an overthrowing of the government based off of your definition what what you
(2:41:28) understand many boundaries yeah no no if you've got a bunch of people even if they smoke weed if they're committing
(2:41:34) acts of violence as a as a big group in order to pressure people to change laws no I don't think that's like a not serious thing I think it's a really
(2:41:40) serious serious thing you think a bunch of people Gathering Together smoking weed if
(2:41:45) police come to try to control that situation they start protesting against it as a part of group think like this is
(2:41:53) common psychology like it takes one person to go against police for a bunch of people to do that you think those
(2:41:59) people are equivalent to people trying to overthrow a government no I don't think so no but I don't know if that
(2:42:05) would even count as an Insurrection by that it was just a bunch of people that got together and they're smoking weed or whatever and end up bring in a riot no I
(2:42:10) don't think that that would necessarily be an Insurrection but they're they got together against that law against weed
(2:42:18) theyve got violent or threatening the way you said like it's Crossing every every four list okay hold on you know
(2:42:25) what here's this is the argument I would make also and if any other caller wants to say this I'm going to I'm going to flip this on them if somebody wants to give a different positive definition
(2:42:32) then fine go for it but like I'm not going to sit here and play through every single of like the most absurd hypothetical you can give me if you want
(2:42:38) to argue against me you're arguing against the historical and judicial record in the United States if you want to give another definition of insurrection that's fine but it can't
(2:42:44) just be what if two people go into the forest and they say the government and they kick a ferally owned tree as hard
(2:42:49) as possible in order to like it's yeah I mean we can probably find definitions around the edges that are like well I
(2:42:55) don't know I mean I guess technically this would be an Insurrection maybe it would qualify but I'm not going to yeah if you want to give an alternate
(2:43:00) positive definition for it then we can critique that one but this is the one that exists in the historical record like that's yeah my main point was you
(2:43:07) could technically say a bunch of things was Insurrection so let's not let's not like if that's the case then an
(2:43:13) Insurrection the word Insurrection is not that serious but it's very serious just because there's a name for this I
(2:43:19) don't know if it's the Continuum fallacy or what but just because you can't like concretely Define it every single edge of particular thing doesn't mean that
(2:43:25) you can say well that thing doesn't exist or it's not very serious that's that's yeah that's just not true we can we can imagine a ton of crimes that are
(2:43:32) very serious and not serious that are the same crime you could say one thing is more serious than another being the
(2:43:37) same thing but yeah so I can say there are some insurrections that are probably really bad and historically in the United States there are some insurrections that probably weren't that
(2:43:43) bad right like that I think that Whiskey Rebellion was over like [ __ ] tax stamps I think the biggest deal was it was it was a big one and it had to do
(2:43:48) with like the first time National like Army had been mobilized for anything but like that it probably wasn't that big of a deal every Insurrection isn't the
(2:43:53) worst type of insurrection I think this particular Insurrection was really bad but we can't even agree on what the definition of insurrection is and the
(2:43:59) reason why is because Andrew knows if he gives any definition of an Insurrection it's either going to exclude everything from being an Insurrection or it'll
(2:44:04) easily include January 6th all what
(2:44:09) up all right was there somebody else next this is um yeah I got you got to go
