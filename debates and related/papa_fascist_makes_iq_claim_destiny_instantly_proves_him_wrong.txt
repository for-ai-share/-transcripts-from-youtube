(0:00) patriarchy is awesome I know this is hard and offensive or whatever triggers you whatever to hear it but right now
(0:05) Society is oriented around high IQ workers tend to earn more money I guess
(0:10) I guess I would too I don't think that nurses have a higher IQ than electricians do seems like electricians
(0:16) are some of the highest IQ Tradesmen and their IQ is around 110 and it feels like it looks like nurses are like 116 to
(0:22) 120. so even electricians which are the highest IQ of the Tradesman it seems like nurses are higher
(0:28) there you go there's a shot right there they're just told to go outside oh it's intuitive what I nothing about what I
(0:33) just said was intuitive it is intuitive the only reason that you're young
(0:41) can you tell me what I just said those examples we're anecdotal no they
(0:48) were examples for how to deal that's not an anecdote an anecdote is a story that's happened in the past hypothetical examples where two stories happen in the
(0:56) past that's not an anecdote if I say if I just describe to this being one no if I say hey how can I help how can I
(1:03) discipline a student in the class you go well you could give the student A detention if he misbehaves you go oh well that's an anecdote that's not an
(1:08) anecdote do you know what an anecdote is foreign epic lineup for you today we got destiny
(1:16) Michael Sartain Andrew from The Crucible Angela Knight and Malik is going to be coming in a few minutes I think there's
(1:21) going to be a really really interesting debate so the topic that most of you guys picked that you want to see this uh
(1:27) debate is is patriarchy bad for men and women uh the second topic that we will probably discuss will either be the male
(1:34) depression one or evolutionary psychology uh I do believe that the patriarchy has um done its job I don't
(1:40) believe that it's necessary for men or for women anymore um I believe that we live in a society oh it's not Malik
(1:48) uh I do believe that the society that we live in now um it's just uh moving forward and I
(1:53) think that we do need to focus on um the evolution of men and women so I don't really know how referring back to
(1:59) a blueprint that worked in the 1950s is going to be something that we can can just I don't know progress that's just
(2:06) me so yeah now let me really quickly explain to you so the the proposition we're discussing is patriarchy good or
(2:13) bad for men and women so you can think it's good for men bad for women you can think it's bad for both and we're just doing quick opening statements about one
(2:20) or two minutes and then after that it's gonna be open Panel you guys are gonna go at it and in an hour I'll introduce a
(2:25) different topic all right Andrew uh yeah I think the patriarchy is awesome it's good for men and women it's
(2:32) also necessary so it's a it's a logical necessity in order to maintain Society you have to use force it doesn't matter
(2:39) if you're maintaining it the law enforcement level where you're protecting it with the military men are the only ones really who are going to be
(2:45) able to maintain that force uh whether people want to believe that or not it's true and so yes uh patriarchy is not
(2:52) only necessary but it's always going to be the default on every society everywhere on planet Earth at all times
(2:58) there's really not anything you're going to be able to do about it no matter how much you get you push towards egalitarianism it's still going to end
(3:04) up being patriarchal um and that's kind of a descriptive is so it depends on how people wanted to
(3:09) find patriarchy but from my perspective uh yeah I think patriarchy is not only
(3:15) not only good but necessary okay cool Michael you are up next uh
(3:21) yeah like Andrew said it depends on how we Define it if it is the idea that men are going to take roles that require
(3:27) more physical strength or more assertiveness then yes by default we're just going to be living in a patriarchy if patriarchy means that there is a
(3:33) nefarious attempt specifically just to keep women down for the sake of keeping women down I don't necessarily agree
(3:39) with that to the same extent but if there is a patriarchy one of the main victims of the patriarchy are going to
(3:45) be men who suffer from depression more who commit suicide more who die from accidents more
(3:50) uh in those type of situations so I actually think if there is a patriarchy the the victims of the patriarchy are or
(3:57) the biggest victims of the patriarchy or low status men whereas you'll have some women who are at the bottom who can marry their way out of the caste system
(4:03) that they're in out of whatever socioeconomic group they're in those men at the at the bottom rungs cannot so
(4:08) that would be that would be my argument in that in that case yeah Michael brought up a good point is we all need to be kind of agreeing definition of
(4:14) patriarchy so that's quickly Google does we're going off uh Cambridge uh a former Social organization in which fathers or
(4:21) other males so males control the family uh tribe or a larger social unit which would involve a government or society
(4:27) organized in this way uh so that's kind of the general definition I think we should uh work with so basically yeah so
(4:34) that's that's kind of the gist of it all right anyway I think uh next is Destiny
(4:40) yeah I when you kind of like really broad forms of societal organization I think it's hard to say if it's like good
(4:45) or bad there's definitely negative aspects of patriarchy there's definitely positive aspects of patriarchy
(4:51) um I think that where we're at right now socially I think it's kind of run its course I don't think there's as many huge benefits to be seen for having like
(4:58) such a strict hierarchy unlike men over women especially as women who continue to achieve highly in places like
(5:03) education and now increasingly more in the work environment so I think we're I think we're probably ready for the next
(5:09) form of social organization that isn't strictly built around male hierarchy over female
(5:14) automatic you are up
(5:22) uh doing basically everything that men also can do um I think patriarchy is W's in chat
(5:30) um I think men are meant to be rulers and women are meant to be supporters and nurturers
(5:44) yeah it's gonna be an interesting combination Andrew and Alex all right so now we're getting to the open Panel part
(5:49) so you guys can just go at it I will make sure the debate doesn't evolve or get too sidetracked but it's gonna be
(5:55) just you guys so kick it off whoever wants to
(6:00) so one of the things that gets really annoying and I know we have to do this on YouTube because we're trying to get views or whatever but it's the idea of
(6:06) like what is a high status man and then the definition is so incredibly vague we spend half an hour trying to figure out
(6:12) what that term means it's the same kind of situation here like when I hear people complaining about about a
(6:17) patriarchy what I'm hearing is I am a victim because there is a nefarious attempt by men specifically to keep
(6:22) other people down and so when I hear that that is not the same definition as what I saw with that dictionary definition that Alex just read which is
(6:29) the idea that yes men have 17 times as much testosterone genetically heritably than women do and so because of that
(6:35) they're just they're going to have bigger stronger joints and muscles they're going to be more aggressive they're going to be the ones protecting
(6:41) the tribe building the buildings they're going to be the ones protecting the tribes from predators they're going to be the ones out there procuring the
(6:46) resources and so because of that we're going to have a patriarchy by default if the if the idea is like for instance
(6:52) that that Barbie movie where the patriarchy is this is this basically this mechanism by which to keep all
(6:57) women down in every single case I don't agree with that and therefore we're just those are two different discussions we're having does that make sense mm-hmm
(7:04) yeah that's why I think it's important so definition I think we should work with is a uh a system where the man is
(7:11) in charge of the family uh social institutions and ultimately the government uh women have control on that
(7:17) uh now whether it's something that's like through Force where women can't get in I think that doesn't happen in
(7:23) reality right now so there's no point even getting into that but it's a system that's basically dominated by men that's essentially the the Crux of it
(7:31) yeah I think the issue is that when we talk about like differences in testosterone and ability to defend
(7:36) people from like violence these are like the least important things that exist in society today uh probably things like IQ
(7:43) or your ability to do well in school or work certain types of jobs are becoming increasingly more important and these
(7:49) are arenas where women are at parity or slightly better or slightly worse thing we're talking about with men and a lot
(7:55) of different circumstances so the idea of building all of our society and our hierarchies around who can kill who with
(8:00) their bare fists probably is a very relevant or effective in organizing society today yeah but you Destiny you
(8:06) would agree that we have to have an enforcement arm which enforces the laws of the nation and that men are going to
(8:12) be the default for that enforcement arm basically it all depends no that's not even remotely true no it is true it's
(8:20) not okay but demonstrate how it's not can a can a judge be a woman
(8:25) yeah judges aren't the enforcement arm the enforcement armor the people who are
(8:30) going to be out there enforcing the law okay so judges are absolutely part of our enforcement as part of our Criminal
(8:37) Justice System um but you're saying that just the cops themselves might have to be mad let's well let's back up let's back up what
(8:44) does a judge enforce so a judge will lay down you know uh their judgment but
(8:49) they're not enforcing the Judgment themselves other people are doing that enforcement for them right
(8:55) okay so if you're saying that at the end of the day the people that apply physical violence might have to be men
(9:01) if at the very end of that chain then I we can say that but I still wouldn't organize an entire society around that
(9:07) yeah but it's going to be a necessity that that Society is organized around that why would it be why would we
(9:13) organize all of our society around one of the least important parts of our society that is about the most important
(9:18) part is the enforcement and defense of your Society I can't think of a more important part of of society than the
(9:24) enforcement of its laws and the defense of its people can you um I think that that is a bare minimum
(9:31) threat that's like saying the most important part of society is like access to food or water I mean while it's
(9:36) technically true that's not what's separating out like the great societies from the middling ones right like that
(9:43) solving like enforcing crime is a is not a very complex problem now solving the
(9:49) conditions for crime is complex but just the enforcement mechanisms for I guess arresting people or holding people in prison is not the most pressing or
(9:55) important part of a country today wait a second about the things which give Nations the greatest amount of stability
(10:01) especially as if they're a nation of laws and a nation of Law and Order I would say that's a pivotal fundamental
(10:08) foundation for your nation to thrive like Somalia is not doing so hot right
(10:14) places without Law and Order okay so let's think of like hang on hang on let me finish and then I'll take it back over same thing with the military the
(10:21) military one of the reasons we're one of the most powerful Nations on planet Earth and have such security is because
(10:26) we have such a massive of National Defense System and yes I think enforcement is pivotal to all societies
(10:34) everywhere at all times regardless of their technology level or not if you're comparing like what country is more
(10:40) successful Germany France the UK Norway Sweden the United States Canada at any
(10:45) point of this conversation is the enforcement mechanism for cracking people on the street ever entering the
(10:51) conversation well it's assumed so these are Baseline assumptions so what just because we
(10:58) assume that this is already kind of baked into the pie yeah so therefore we're not talking about it doesn't mean that it's not one of the most important
(11:04) fundamentals it's important but it's fundamental and largely solved that's not going to be just like I said for
(11:09) food and water no one's going to say France is better than Germany because less people are starving to death that's an assumed thing though like things like
(11:16) distribution of food and water in most First World countries and a lot of their workers just largely been figured out so these aren't the things that we ought to
(11:22) be focusing on these days but I think that they are because when those enforcement mechanisms begin to break
(11:28) down like we saw with BLM riots and things like this Society itself begins to shake apart at its core so I do think
(11:35) that it is important that we do start to look at these things as these systems begin to break down I mean you were kind
(11:41) of on the Forefront for instance with I I don't even know if I can say the name on YouTube right but with the the whole
(11:47) thing that happened with the three guys and the dude with the AR right you were on the Forefront of that because on
(11:52) YouTube I don't I don't know if you can or you
(11:58) you were kind of at the Forefront of that you understand that a nation of laws when you have a breakdown of Law
(12:04) and therefore enforcement that that defaults back to something that's more primitive which then becomes males who
(12:11) are enforcing whatever their own law is I mean so I think that this is something that is pivotal and it is happening in
(12:17) society and that's another helpful case for why the patriarchy is good I think Sartain wanted to say something so let's
(12:23) just make sure he gets his chances yeah so so there are multiple facets right so if you take like a hierarchy of needs if
(12:29) Society is running properly you don't need as much law enforcement like I had a buddy of mine say uh laws are only uh
(12:35) as Bradley he was saying laws are for peop if you have a society full of nothing but good men you don't need laws but the problem is like for instance if
(12:42) I live and I have a nice day and all the thing I'm worried about is like buying a gift for my wife or or taking my dog out
(12:48) to the park and then all sudden somebody starts choking me the most important thing in the world becomes air right now
(12:53) all of a sudden my priorities change to survival I think Andrew's correct if we get to a point where things break down
(12:58) it's like is the are The Men Who conduct the violence the most important parts of society when you're Ukraine and Russia
(13:04) invades then they become the most important important part of society during other parts of time maybe they are maybe they aren't
(13:10) but my point is I just just so we can uh you know play devil's advocate here Destiny let's just say that you're right
(13:16) that it's the least important part of society the testosterone argument was that men are going to be more assertive
(13:21) and therefore because they're going to be more assertive they're going to have roles in like say Politics as Executives
(13:27) at different companies they're just going to have those roles more like I was in the US Military and we in we try
(13:33) to get as many female Pilots into the U.S military as possible it was definitely uh an organized effort to do so and there were still eight or nine
(13:40) times as many men as women pilot applicants because men in those fields just had the proclivity to want to do
(13:46) those things so that maybe that was my argument before instead of saying well men are only there to just conduct
(13:52) violence men are also just more assertive and want jobs to deal with like problem solving as far as construction unless you think that
(13:58) that's not the case that like maybe women would take those jobs if things were more egalitarian I think men are
(14:04) more interested in being politicians they're more interested in being firefighters they're more interested in being construction workers they're more
(14:09) interested in being in the Infantry than women are I think in the most egalitarian society where everything has been 100 socially equalized I think
(14:16) you'd probably still see a pretty big difference between the types of jobs that men and women choose uh I wouldn't deny that I just I don't know if I would
(14:22) consider that patriarchy at that point but I mean yeah I mean but which goes back to my original argument I don't
(14:27) think that's patriarchy I think men being more assertive is just a function that leads to a society that we're in now and it's not good or bad it's just
(14:34) the way that it is because we had two genders in this species and one of the genders had to compete and had to protect the other gender and therefore
(14:40) that's why we're bigger and stronger and that's why we tend to be more assertive in our different roles but I think the
(14:46) difference is that like is it do we have a society um like Michael says where men just
(14:51) gravitate towards different jobs as women do or do we have a society that Andrew wants where it's like women aren't allowed to go to school or
(14:57) something you know like I think that's the difference in what wait wait wait what did I when did I say that I thought
(15:03) we had a debate once aren't you opposed to women having a college education no okay I'm mixing up with someone else son
(15:08) okay no but something not only and kind of yeah
(15:14) on that so that you know women have always traditionally done since uh
(15:19) they've been allowed to go into education they've always outperformed men always they've always outperformed men
(15:25) and from the educational standpoint this has always been the case uh at the college level and uh even pre-college
(15:32) level they've always outperformed men the reason for this is because it's more conducive uh for women that type of
(15:38) setting is more conducive there's far less rough play there's far less you know of this type of thing but they've pretty much always outperform men so
(15:44) that's I'm I'm kind of giving you that but also just so that you understand and I kind of take issue with what Michael's
(15:51) saying here what I'm talking about is a foundational level so I'm saying there's an equalization of force which does not
(15:57) exist so egalitarianism in itself I think is false anyway because there is no such thing as an equalization of
(16:03) force between men and women I think that necessarily you're always going to have patriarchy in one form or another
(16:09) regardless of how much you try to push towards egalitarianism because it's impossible not to because of that
(16:16) Equalization of force differential and that Equalization of force differential is so wide that a small core of men can
(16:24) basically overrule a large body of women but the opposite can never be true Angela
(16:39) um yeah I mean my biggest issue with Andrew is saying that we can't be in a egalitarian society I think my um I I
(16:45) guess like if you want to go off of like what you only know saying that you know men have always worked hard they've been
(16:50) the the laborers of America but I think that if you look at the stats now that men are no longer working and going to
(16:56) school so I'm really curious as to how um it can't be egalitarian the society if they're not putting in the the work
(17:03) that they used to well because because it necessarily can't actually be equal because there's no Equalization of force
(17:10) women will always have to depend on men to enforce their rights and they'll always have to depend on men to enforce
(17:17) their well-being they'll always have to depend on men to make the enforcement for all of the things that they want and
(17:23) desire for themselves they can't enforce those things on their own they need men to enforce them for them and men do not
(17:30) need women to enforce their own rights they do not need women to enforce their own agendas they don't need women for
(17:36) any of that but women necessarily need men to do that for them could I say it like this maybe Andrew at the core
(17:41) fundamental the basis of society you need men willing to do violence in order to protect the rights of other people
(17:47) well it's not just that though so I want to be very clear with this it's not just that you need to have aggressive men who
(17:54) are willing to conduct violence in order to keep a society together it's that fundamentally women must depend on men
(18:02) to enforce their rights period period they have to so egalitarianism I think
(18:07) even as a proposition is false I don't even think it's possible I think from a foundational level it's always going to
(18:13) be patriarch patriarchal due to this Gap and philosophers have talked about this
(18:18) uh for you know basically a thousand years still have biblical uh theologians
(18:23) and it's one of the huge gaps when you're talking about uh egalitarianism how for instance Angela how do you
(18:31) enforce your own personal rights absent men absent men collectively assisting you in
(18:37) doing that how would you do that well I mean I guess like in what state are we living in that we constantly need
(18:42) management anywhere you want any imaginary places I'm living in America with this great citizenship that I have
(18:47) I don't have to constantly live in fear that someone needs to enforce my rights I'm
(18:54) need to be there to protect us from what other men like so is the issue is like other men beating on other men so this
(19:01) goes back to like a men's issue men give Women rights and Men give other men right that's okay so because they're the
(19:08) enforcement arm they are going to be the people who deliver rights to women or take rights away from women or deliver
(19:14) rights to men or take rights away from men so men are always going to be the dominance in force and so therefore
(19:21) they're always going to be the decider of who gets the rights can you think of an all-time industry I'm sorry so why
(19:26) are men failing in this current society and if they're not failing they're so failing good how are they feeling yeah
(19:32) but you just said you were safe Angelus I don't know that they're failing right I don't know if that that's it's just right now we like the way that
(19:38) Society works we have a whole like it's men don't do anything it's the massive
(19:44) institutions that we've created around our countries that ensure rights you don't get rights from men you get rights from the protections that the
(19:50) institutions of government have guaranteed you right there are men in all sorts of different countries but the rights that women have afforded them
(19:55) dramatically vary from country to Country regardless of what man is going to protect them you know you might have the strongest male Defender ever in
(20:01) Afghanistan but it doesn't mean you're going to college if you're a woman there um and also just when you compare country to Country and you're looking
(20:07) for like what are the most successful countries that's not the ones with the most Alpha men or the most manly men protecting the rights it's generally
(20:13) you're looking for things like do women have access to birth control and are they participating in the economy so I don't know it's just like it's a very
(20:19) crude argument well there's a bunch of things that are kind of smuggled in there right so the first thing is kind
(20:24) of smuggled in is you talk about institutions being the Protectors of Rights institutions are just a coalition
(20:30) of people individuals they're going to rely on the enforcement arm also of men you say it's not masculine men who are
(20:37) defending these rights however it is masculine men who are in the military in law enforcement things like this who are
(20:43) the enforcement arm of these rights who these government institutions rely heavily on in order to enforce what
(20:49) their will is so does that means do you think then that the countries where women have the most rights of the
(20:54) countries with the most masculine strong men so they're not mutually exclusive or not
(21:00) I don't know I'm asking because you make it sound like it's just strong men that Grant right so does that mean that if I were to look at all the women's rights
(21:06) in the world are the women's problem there there's a smuggle in again where you say you say strong masculine men are
(21:11) the only ones doing them just saying men is the defaults are the ones who are doing this wait wait but why you say men are the default like we can run that
(21:18) back a little bit more reductively shouldn't be six feet or taller man like don't all men that are five eight and lower get their rights from men that are
(21:23) six feet and taller no why not because they don't have any uh non-equalization on four so five foot eight person can
(21:30) defend themselves against a six foot person in general do you think that's true
(21:35) I think that there are some advantages but if you're going to do that then on no no no not Summit
(21:40) scores you think 5A men are defending those ones well hang on so if we're going to use if we're going to use
(21:46) averages and let's use averages and say that we have an average for a reason because most men are inside of that
(21:51) average right so if that's true then most of the men who would be falling in these jobs are going to be within that
(21:57) average depth sure but I'm just I'm just asking if we run this all the way back so any man that's below the average height any man that's five nine or lower
(22:03) their rights are also being defended by men that are six two and taller well no that wouldn't be a direct coalet for
(22:10) Equalization because we're six foot because men who are six foot there's far fewer of them than men who are in the
(22:16) average aggregate so therefore the force Equalization is different however if you're looking at the force differential
(22:21) from men to women the average is so lopsided that even weak men can generally defend themselves fairly well
(22:28) against strong women if you want to do voice Equalization there then shouldn't we be looking at people that prefer a heavily patriarchal society versus
(22:33) people that prefer more egalitarian in one and the force Equalization for women on the egalitarian would be probably that most men would side with that over
(22:39) the ones that want the heavily patriarchal one yeah but that would go with my point which is that men are the
(22:44) ones who are the rights givers but men aren't just the rights givers there because a coalition of five nine and
(22:49) shorter men uh with women are probably going to defend rights more than a coalition of six foot plus Alpha men but
(22:55) the distinction there is that you you said it yourself it would be a coalition of men and women but it'll never be
(23:01) women so it'll never be five years I don't think right no it will always be
(23:07) the default will always go to men men can always enforce really cut it off at just men but not go into any of the
(23:13) delineations I just went into every delineation with you which one would you like to go into right I mean I already said it I think
(23:19) that you could argue that like stronger or I'm sorry taller men are the ones that run society and shorter men only
(23:24) exist in society essentially at the behest of larger men basically yeah but we just covered this that's true you could say that but if you're looking at
(23:31) an average then you're saying that the men who are outside of the average are fewer in number than the men who are in
(23:36) the average so they're outnumbered so I don't know what your point is I mean it could be the slightly taller men could
(23:42) probably take on 1.5 shorter man I'm sure we could find some average where 30 percent of men in society can run the other 70 it's just like nobody's little
(23:49) men yeah I think and it's no men sure yeah it is men but now I'm going into height but you want to go back on just
(23:55) the man the think the fact that it's like the man thing but again and to go very broad because now I mean I I feel
(24:01) like we kind of see how ridiculous the argument is and just like saying just man just manage this man like I haven't heard you reviewed it broadly speaking
(24:07) right it's hard to refuel because it's almost unfalsifiable because you're talking about half the population of the planet right
(24:13) like how am I supposed to refute that men are important regarding rights there are no countries there are no countries
(24:18) that exist without men but when I try to think of like well what's the reputation of this here would be an interesting thing do the countries with the
(24:24) strongest men have the most rights not really no in fact just the opposite I remember hearing so many jokes about
(24:29) because Russia is so masculine and manly that all the trans Ukrainian soldiers were going to be getting murdered by the
(24:35) brave Russian soldiers and here we've got drone operators you know tossing grenades on Russian troops blowing themselves right so it doesn't seem to
(24:40) be the case that like just strong men are a good protector of Rights hang on wait a second go for it so man can take
(24:47) your rights away in those other countries too no not just men those countries can take your rights away you
(24:52) need a whole interview using the enforcement arm of who which sex do you think countries are powered by men and
(24:58) women when the Soviet Union beat Nazi Germany when so when the Soviet it's not just about the enforcement arm who's
(25:04) giving them the arms to enforce usually other men who manufactures the guns who manufacture men okay do you
(25:12) know what if there's female gun makers all over the world yeah what do you think was working production in World War II when all of our men were going
(25:17) overseas they were designing the guns there was literally on an assembly line putting a screw in a
(25:23) piece of metal they weren't designing weapons that's great at the end of the day both jobs matter you could be the
(25:29) best engineer in the world you know there's somebody building your it doesn't matter right yeah that's nice women can be a labor force if men
(25:34) allow them to that's right and what I'm saying you can say if men alone however you want to say it or whatever but the reality is at the end of the day it's
(25:40) not just men right you need both halves of society working together to actually  accomplish anything there is no
(25:45) Society or country smuggling yeah just men again you're smuggling in just men
(25:51) what I'm saying to you specifically is that men are the enforcement arm and nobody's building if men say no
(25:56) that's what I'm saying women aren't going to be able to go to men and say no you know what we're going to do it anyway if men don't want them to Destiny
(26:03) that's the distinction well I disagree with what you're saying because I understand what you're saying it sounds like it sounds great on paper
(26:10) but if we again look at the stats right now the suicide rates are up men are dying men aren't going to school they've
(26:15) dropped out of school during covet yeah but Angela the point of the patriarchy wasn't to just do the point of the paint
(26:20) what do you say the patriarchy it wasn't that all men do better because I've heard this argument before yes men are
(26:25) going to commit suicide more because there's men at the bottom of the society that are not benefiting from this patriarchy right does that make sense so
(26:33) I I've heard the argument before but like the idea that men are suffering isn't really the reason why the
(26:38) patriarchy isn't working it's like the the point that's trying to make is Andrew's uh guys tell me if I'm wrong
(26:43) here Anderson is saying that the foundation of society there are men who have to enforce and to take certain jobs
(26:49) that have to do with military law enforcement Etc and what Destiny is saying is that while that is a a part of
(26:55) society and probably a more important part of society in the past today it's a less important Society because we have
(27:01) technology because we have you know someone who's a computer programmer doesn't matter if they're a man or woman people can be successful entrepreneurs
(27:07) and be men or women and I totally understand both both parts of those but my issue the initial thing that I was
(27:12) saying before was that because men are generally are more aggressive they're going to fill more parts of those Society more parts of that Society
(27:20) um being entrepreneurs being CEOs of companies being in the US military being
(27:26) bodyguards and except stuff like that so yeah so I mean I I hear that you're the
(27:34) same but this all sounds like it's just like Labor Force jobs but meanwhile like the society is thriving off of multiple
(27:39) things that doesn't require you to just be like a Barbarian so I don't understand why we continues to go back
(27:44) to the statement because both things because both things are important because both things are important but it's completely just highlighted in the
(27:50) fact that it's only men but if you really look thriving in it women are working more
(27:55) 7.2 million men aren't working so what are those men doing that that they're contributing to the Patriot that's so
(28:00) important that men can't enforce those guys who aren't working who aren't doing  so I'm confused women are only able
(28:06) to work in modernity the way that they are because men maintain the entirety of
(28:11) the infrastructure inside of every single nation on the planet women do not maintain infrastructure their top jobs
(28:18) are teaching serving things like this they don't work in infrastructure they
(28:24) don't work in Paving the roads they don't work with the air conditioners they don't work with the electricity
(28:30) they don't work with any of these things they're very low scale do they work in any of these industries the scales are
(28:36) so lopsided that you almost can just take the women out because they're so irrelevant to most of these industries
(28:41) so the thing is I gotta ask you like you say women are doing all this these these great things like they're all enabled by
(28:49) the patriarchal system which literally has men competing with men which we're
(28:54) supposed to be doing and we'd love to do that uh for you know status for all the of these different things but the
(29:00) entirety of the world that you live in currently that women are thriving in all of it is maintained by men and very
(29:06) little of it is maintained by women do you think that in a society without men women couldn't do these things
(29:11) like you're you're picking the most yeah but like yes these are the bottom men of
(29:17) society these are the not to be me but these are the bottom of the of all electricians are the bottom of society
(29:23) I'm sorry I'm sorry electricians are building the roads
(29:28) that I said the infrastructure and yes they are electricians are building the end the most and also yes electricians
(29:34) or trade jobs would go underneath College jobs you want to compare them to other Educators
(29:40) because they require less training and they pay less they don't require less training they by
(29:46) definition do require traffic then show me the definition where college degree means less training than a trade degree
(29:53) because typically trades are something that you can train into in a shorter period of time than a more specialized
(29:58) college degree level job no in fact to go from a journeyman to a Master takes
(30:03) many many many years of training this I call it you're comparing a master we're not talking about a four-year degree
(30:09) grad holder as being a master who do you think will make more money a master software engineer or a master electrician or Carpenter
(30:16) uh well it depends on what the electrician is doing if they're a master electrician for instance and they're
(30:22) working inside of a nuclear Silo I think that they're probably making a lot of  money okay if they're a master software engineer their name is Mark
(30:28) Zuckerberg yeah I mean we can play a lot of money but that's an exception yeah but now
(30:33) Zuckerberg so you're saying you're saying on exception you think people in the trades
(30:39) make more money than people with college degrees uh if they're men yeah often they do yes
(30:48) it's definitely catching up because because what's happened is there's so the labor force is not really uh there's
(30:55) a lot of men out there that are not working and uh we had Waller on our show Justin Waller and he talks about like when he has Union people that come on to
(31:02) work on some of his building sites his construction sites those guys he would take those over a master's degree a
(31:09) hundred times out of 100. now is that an exception is that everywhere over a masturbation
(31:15) Malik just yeah one word and she hasn't spoken yeah go ahead go ahead Malik sorry
(31:20) um so in regards to like woman being in the workforce I think Angelo's the one who brought that up woman literally
(31:26) would not be able to get to work would not be able to work would not be able to do anything if men didn't exist men
(31:31) built the roads that they drive on men built the cars that they drive men built the buildings that they work in most of
(31:37) the time their boss or their CEO is a man um because men just do things better
(31:43) um and that's not even being sexist that's that's just facts like if men didn't exist woman literally wouldn't
(31:49) even be able to work so to even bring up the point like oh a lot of the workforce is a woman that's irrelevant because
(31:54) every woman working could be replaced by a man and yes you could say the other around but you're not going to see a
(32:00) woman Paving the roads you're not going to see a woman being civil engineers you're not going to see a woman like
(32:05) doing it I mean they could they they could but they don't they choose jobs that don't require degrees they choose
(32:11) jobs that they can just be nurturers and supporters aren't women going to school more than men now what do you mean they
(32:17) choose jobs don't require degrees
(32:23) okay I guess nursing requires a degree right there's a lot of female nurses but
(32:28) like a four-year degree sometimes but yeah more women are entering med school now than men like I mean customer
(32:34) support work as secretaries work as servers like versus men who are civil
(32:40) engineers who are Architects architecture doesn't require degrees of certificate but a woman wouldn't be able
(32:46) to function without men and I don't know how like men can't function without women what are these weird arguments of women like what world do you guys live
(32:52) in it's like both things I don't know well when you say when you say that from a competition between the two Sexes like
(32:58) I think when we speak about a competition but I think you make it sound like it because you continue yourself
(33:03) and we're just like subjective to men in everything we do and I'm just saying why do we have to frame it in that way and
(33:09) as if that's the only like this Indian giving because it's true because it's true it is historically men have given
(33:15) you these things sure sure but we're speaking in this time and I'm saying that I don't believe that it's why necessary I don't understand how men are
(33:22) falling behind in society yet still saying that we own the robots
(33:28) because of this feminists
(33:35) of femininity because if you don't if you're not six feet tall if you don't make six figures you're not if you
(33:42) won't get a girl to submit to it it doesn't make any sense that's a dumb red pill theory is so below average men idolizing above
(33:50) average men that they'll never be that's like that's the non-existent internet like mentality you're going on the
(33:55) speaking points that this is what women need to do to just stay in the kitchen and just stay at home so whatever that
(34:00) woman should stay in the kitchen I wouldn't want to do pretty well in the kitchen but I didn't say they should stay there I think women should work I
(34:06) think there's nothing wrong with that but the fact that like in equal Society
(34:11) is even possible I just think that's crazy like you can never have a society where both gender roles are not
(34:18) important in their own individual way yeah but that's different from what you said in the beginning you're saying that
(34:24) women don't basically contribute Society basically can just stay at home it's basically referring it too I said that
(34:30) women would not even be able to be in the workforce if it wasn't for all the work men have done
(34:37) if it wasn't for women men wouldn't have meals a woman didn't cook it there are so many things that were complimentary
(34:42) but again it's a problem the way that you're famous I think is like competition because they wouldn't have meals if women didn't cook them
(34:48) isn't that why men want wives like you guys would just be eating food all the time I don't get it
(34:54) men can't cook themselves healthy food women can't build roads no they can't
(35:00) they're not even physically built to do it they're not physical what do you think those jobs aren't you actually picking the road up and pushing down
(35:06) mostly they said you have tools and stuff that you use what do you think yeah I know I know have you ever done one of those jobs I did I was a
(35:12) car vacated with a drywall installation we took our basements yeah let me know let me notate some differences
(35:18) for you we have different skeletal structures
(35:24) they physiologically cannot do a lot of these jobs the average construction job
(35:29) doesn't have to be outside in Phoenix in 120 degree weather if you're building a  road Destiny men take breaks
(35:35) when it's really hot outside you know that right yeah yeah and they're gonna have to work in those
(35:40) conditions the the concept back and forth like I'm still I'm trying to understand this and maybe I don't get
(35:45) this but if you guys were building roads and infrastructures and there weren't women would you still be doing this would you be living in Hudson sleeping
(35:52) on futons again it goes back to where you do need each other you guys do this  for women women do for men so
(35:57) again it's still it's egalitarian I don't give a anyone says that doesn't make sense
(36:03) in a patriarchy there's both men and women the man's role is to be a leader a
(36:08) guide or whatever and the woman's role is to nurture and support the man in a functioning patriarchy correct sure but
(36:16) what is a man leading to this day and age I don't understand if we're in an egalitarian society it's they're exactly
(36:23) equal there's no rules women do the same  men do Yes actually men do yeah you have you have
(36:32) all these labor intensity and I saying this as someone who worked in construction for four years and
(36:37) as someone who's been in the blue collar and white collar Fields men just do it
(36:43) better men are faster at doing like that they are physically
(36:48) built for that versus women do so much better in a nurturing or supporting role
(36:53) in society what did you do at print construction for four years a woman theoretically could
(36:59) wait I'm curious what your job was before what because Eric no offense to anybody that works these jobs most people I knew are lazy as okay Blue
(37:05) Collar guys or at least in the industries I worked on are not running around like work is super horrible you're generally doing as
(37:10) little as you can to cash out as much as you can before the somebody catches you jerking off or mess around or whatever like it's not like these
(37:15) people are out here like Arnold Schwarzenegger like building entire  houses in their back like what are we talking about right now
(37:21) Yeah well yeah they are and they are working hard they're working long hours yeah they're working 60 70 hours a week
(37:27) they are hauling extraordinarily heavy things their work requirements for uh
(37:33) even basic factory work is very strenuous on the body what the are you talking about
(37:39) then I think that obviously here's what Malik's job was I don't know I don't think yeah the construction industry
(37:46) you think that installing it for example all right are you saying destiny that
(37:53) are you are you saying that uh working on Robotics and working on machines is
(37:58) not hard difficult strenuous work because it is I've never seen an industry where everybody is Hardcore
(38:04) busting their ass like constantly on the  they're doing I'm pretty sure even I'm pretty sure even the meme is is that
(38:10) like if you drive around you see people working on roads and 95 percent of the drive you drive by they're literally just standing there now I know
(38:16) that's not happening all the time okay but I'm pretty sure our Blue Collar White Collar most people are just trying
(38:21) to do the least amount of work they can to get by like that's true let me let me concede a few a few points that I would
(38:27) agree that in basically anywhere you go that there's a core group of people who tend to do more work than anybody else
(38:33) does okay so I'll agree that that's true but I don't think that that takes away from the fact that yes these jobs are
(38:40) difficult they are strenuous on the body they do require a lot of work and people are working extremely long hours and
(38:46) yeah I do think that they're busting their ass and I do think that from a physical standpoint that when women are
(38:51) not going to be doing logging and they're not going to be doing Line work for power lines and they physically I
(38:57) don't think most of them are even capable of doing that can you meet me halfway here no I think they can do the job
(39:04) on average because this job suck and chances are if you're part of a lower class family men are just dumb the ones
(39:11) that do those jobs Andrew yes they are yes no they're not okay sorry you're wrong why do you think that these people
(39:18) are just the more successful men are dumb I know this is hard and offensive or whatever triggers you whatever to
(39:24) hear it but right now Society is oriented around high IQ workers tend to earn more money if you were to take the
(39:30) collective IQ of people working in trades and compare them to people working White Collar jobs the people working the white collar jobs are smarter smarter men don't roof smarter
(39:38) men aren't doing power lines smarter men aren't doing construction they're in  air-conditioned offices earning
(39:43) two three four times as much and take their friendly to Disney World twice a year you're talking about an amount of
(39:49) jobs which is minuscule and not even available to most human beings let alone
(39:54) men what do you mean there's a better Raiders of Demand right now for middle
(39:59) class for college educated workers in the United States and there probably ever has been in all of human history so
(40:04) backing up that really doesn't negate what I'm saying which is that there's still only a minuscule amount of these
(40:10) positions where you're earning 300 000 plus dollars a year 300 earning seventy thousand a year
(40:17) earning a hundred thousand dollars a year in a trade is not hard destined you're wrong I'm not wrong you don't
(40:23) earn on average a hundred thousand a year in a trade if you take an average for a journeyman I bet you it's around
(40:29) 50 60 Grand and I guarantee you that anecdotally at least most Tradesmen you talk to because the hours they work
(40:35) probably earning around 80 to 100K yeah okay if you want to go and work two jobs you can do that as a white collar as
(40:41) well I'm not gonna compare people working 80 hours a week well this is part of the confines of the
(40:47) job requirement though you can't leave a line that's running uh because the the
(40:52) clock whistled you might be able to do that in the white collar world but part of the job for maintaining these
(40:58) systems is keeping them up 24 hours a day it's part of the requirement I just want to hear that then I just want to hear your commitment so you think that
(41:04) trade workers on average will out earn um degree workers we'll say stem degree
(41:10) obviously not like an Arts major or something because you're making up wait wait okay so you don't so you don't think they out earn them do you think
(41:15) people that work in the trades will out-earn people on average that work in like they get stem degrees you're literally straw Manning my arguments
(41:24) repeat it back I want to be good faith with you just repeat the argument back can we try something here real quick
(41:30) Destiny so I think what the the argument was is the college degree means less the more people that get college degrees and
(41:37) so those men who get college degrees not all of them are getting bachelor degree level work I know I didn't I got a
(41:43) college degree from UT Austin I ended up managing a strip club or I was a DJ at a strip club afterwards there were no jobs after 9 11. so the not
(41:50) necessarily what's happened is those people who work in trades it's caught up because a lot of people who get college
(41:56) degrees aren't getting those jobs now you're correct if we're just talking about people who get master's degree levels jobs then for sure they're making
(42:03) more money than trades but what what Andrew's saying is like not everyone has those jobs it is not it is there's an
(42:09) availability but only 26 26 of the population makes
(42:14) more than 100 000 a year we're not talking about I'm just saying that on average okay a stem degree person is
(42:21) going to earn more than on average a person for sure
(42:27) because because you said women don't want to work those jobs right and I say
(42:33) no I also said they can't physically fine that's fine that's fine you said women don't and I said that's true but
(42:39) neither do men in a lower class family that are working those jobs where the IQs run low where the college education
(42:45) runs lower somebody's going to be working those jobs it's probably going to be the men and the women are probably going to either be working a
(42:51) service job or they're going to be staying at home taking care of the family but which of these jobs do you think are low IQ jobs trades on average
(42:58) are probably going to skew lower IQ in terms of being capable than STEM related jobs
(43:05) can you demonstrate that I'm actually curious I don't know no you're so  and bad faith if you're
(43:10) gonna sit here and pretend otherwise like that is like almost selfishly going to be true why would
(43:17) that be self-evidently true I think Andrew if he's just talking about stem because remember before the discussion
(43:22) was college education college education all across I know some really stupid people that have bachelor's degrees I
(43:27) don't necessarily think that's the case but if Destiny is just specifically talking about science technology engineering and Mathematics they
(43:33) probably do have a on average yeah but there's an overlap when you're talking about some of those jobs for sure you
(43:39) would consider to be these infrastructure jobs that's the problem that I have correct so I want to know so what I want to know is like if you're
(43:45) saying that somebody who gets a stem degree right in nursing for instance
(43:50) right do you consider that stem I don't know is that do you consider that STEM Science technology probably I guess yeah
(43:57) sure I guess I guess I would too I don't think that nurses have a higher IQ than electricians do I don't think they
(44:03) probably they probably do that'd be my guess well let's let's find out like I'm willing to be wrong but I don't think
(44:08) they do I would jump in just to say that maybe no like I don't think so
(44:13) I would say maybe they do because I think that it's all about how you make your money and I think that if you're just going to use your back a little bit
(44:18) of work I mean how long could you really go before you feel like I'm making all this money and I'm depressed and life sucks as opposed to someone who learns
(44:24) how to make their money A lot smarter um because they have a higher IQ so I don't think that you're actually arguing
(44:31) that in good faith when you say that you don't believe that I mean as somebody who has a background of working in the  now industry we make a lot of
(44:37) money it's quite miserable my whole family makes a lot of money but they're miserable uh me diving into a new space where I have to explore other
(44:43) parts of my brain other than just physical labor I think that's different for me but it's uh the way that we make
(44:48) money it's just different I think that it's uh just just briefly just so I just and then I'll give you the floor back
(44:54) right but you said that you think I'm arguing what in bad faith because it seems like you're not trying to
(45:00) understand what he's trying to say because I I believe that I do understand do you want me to repeat it back sure
(45:05) repeat it that way you know that it's not in bad faith so my argument this has gone from a foundation for why
(45:13) it is that men are necessary in a patriarchy is necessary for enforcement and the conversation graduated from
(45:18) there into what types of jobs men and women can even do what they're even capable of doing from there from there
(45:24) at this point we're moving into if you're talking about trades and you're talking about people in stem Fields
(45:29) Destiny says that the people who are in trades have a lower IQ than people in stem fields on average okay I think that
(45:35) that might be true but I also think there might be overlap between these things when you're talking about the
(45:40) maintenance of society in some of these stem Fields I don't see how what I said was bad faith at all
(45:46) well I think the biggest issue is like not understanding or being I don't know having enough common sense or to realize
(45:52) I think too much of anything is bad I think if we're leaning too much and saying that somebody in stems is um high
(45:57) IQ and they can just accomplish everything in life and they're happy making money
(46:03) Ultra real quick Ultra quick just because I'm Googling and a lot of people typing in the chat it seems like electricians are some of the highest IQ
(46:09) Tradesmen and their IQ is around 110 and it feels like it looks like nurses are like 116 to 120. so even electricians
(46:16) which are the highest IQ of the Tradesman it seems like nurses are higher yeah there you go there's a chart right there so that's that's a IQ
(46:23) distribution by by uh occupation right there um yeah definitely by the way some of the wealthiest people I know most
(46:29) successful work in sales and some of them are not very high IQ so we don't need to necessarily put like how much
(46:35) money you make it directly in correlation with like wait wait wait wait no no we should though that's not fair to say right that's like saying I
(46:41) think Andrew wrote it up earlier Zuckerberg dropped out of college the average College Dropout is not earning 50 billion dollars a year IQ and income
(46:48) in the United States and across all of the western world are going to be generally call it no not generally they're highly correlated they're ultra
(46:54) high but you brought up Zuckerberg you brought up Zuckerberg
(47:00) because he is highly educated just into the conventional way most college students are not as hard as Mark Zuckerberg just because they failed
(47:06) College because you can't do a video English sure that's fine I'm just saying that in
(47:12) general people that are working on the engineering or stem side of things even if we look at electricians who do you think earns more money on average an
(47:17) electrician or somebody gets a degree in electrical engine
(47:27) no nope just by trade oh okay I just went apprenticed yep I don't know why we're so focused on
(47:34) Ikea maybe that's the equivalency someone's good I don't know but hold on if
(47:40) someone's good at a blue collar job if they're professional on what they do I don't think it matters if they're bad at what someone else does
(47:47) like if an engineer is insanely smart at engineering that's great they don't need to be knowledgeable on nursing or
(47:53) knowledgeable on construction or knowledgeable on AC or HVAC or like that like it I think the argument's like
(47:59) complete if you're good at what you do that's all the matters at the end of the day well I think that's a really good rule I think that's absolutely true to
(48:05) master that then then you stick to that yeah that's true and I think generally most women are better at doing certain
(48:13) things than most men are doing are better doing certain things so why are women trying to do things that they're
(48:19) genetically not better at and why are men trying to do women's roles with their genetic yes they can both can do
(48:25) either but it's like if you suck at something and you're good at something else like why do you choose to go out of
(48:31) your way and work the entire point is that people should
(48:37) probably just be able to do and sort themselves into the jobs that they work best at not that all women should do this or all men should do why yeah yeah
(48:43) 100 percent oh okay well then we don't have an argument then
(48:49) so yeah all right I just ended the debate we all agree now there we go we all do I
(48:56) don't think you guys all agree but if you guys are done with this I can move on to the next one unless anyone has anything I think I think we got off the
(49:03) topic of patriarchy and started doing it which I think would be a great discussion to have a correlation of IQ uh and earning potential I think or
(49:09) success in general I think that would be a cool discussion at some of them let's redirect back to the patriarchy and see
(49:16) if there's any uh disagreements left on that still yeah so I still I I still think we got as we got caught up into
(49:22) the weeds I would still like like Angela Knight or Destiny or either on your side to give a refutation of the equalization
(49:29) of power between men and women and how you think we're ever going to move past a patriarchy knowing that there's never
(49:35) going to be an equalization of force I don't I don't I literally don't understand that it's just it's automatic arguing it's like arguing in society
(49:41) like which phenotype would be more suited to Hunter Gathering it's just not really that relevant in terms of the
(49:47) most successful in the world right now how is it not Rel it seems to feel like it's the core placement that you're
(49:53) never going to be able to you know we didn't water our core placements but they're not the big differentiator between the has and the has-nots right
(49:59) now globally speaking okay so I think that's fair to say but if I make the descriptive statement it is true that we
(50:05) need water it is true that we need food it is true we build cities where there's water because there's water there I can
(50:11) agree to all those things but it also is true that men are the enforcement arm of
(50:16) basically all law and defense globally for everybody everywhere at all times how is that ever going to move to it
(50:24) doesn't matter the enforcement arm is not that impressive and it's not really the big differentiator between like
(50:29) there were enforcement arms and societies ten thousand years ago when we first planted our first weed things into
(50:35) the ground so it's just it's not really the big deal of what we're talking about today Destiny Destiny do you think that it was more important that enforcement
(50:42) arm like say in the 1850s or the 1750s and it's become less important as technology is Advanced is that what
(50:47) you're trying to say yeah of course yeah okay
(50:54) so you think as we go further into the future we may see a more egalitarian society because technology will take
(51:00) over some of those labor and defense uh functions that men have yeah I think increasingly our society is becoming
(51:06) more geared around intelligence is basically what society's thinking increasingly the way we fight Wars is
(51:12) more and more geared around high IQ people operating drones operating aircraft operating whatever yeah so your
(51:18) argument is as we get further and further away from a survival scenario we get more and more with the specialized
(51:23) possibility of egalitarianism is is is possible my only argument to that is again men are still more assertive
(51:29) genetically than women so I don't necessarily see that being sure it just depends what I was gonna say it depends on when
(51:35) you say like a Gallatin I don't mean like I said even in a perfectly egalitarian society many women are probably going to gravitate towards difference yes exactly exactly exactly
(51:41) my point and Andrew Andrew your point do you understand what he's saying is like it was probably more important to have
(51:47) those men as enforcement arms and becomes progressively less important as the world like yeah but I don't agree
(51:53) that that's true that's the problem okay go ahead go ahead yeah so I don't actually agree that this is true I think
(51:58) that fundamentally uh you still are confined to the rules right and the
(52:05) rules are in the end not that might makes right but might does make whether you think that it's moral or immoral it
(52:11) does make and fundamentally everything for rights is going to come down to
(52:16) enforcement and it's always is going to come down to men enforcing them giving them gifting them taking them away this
(52:22) type of thing regardless of the technology we've had guns available to women for I don't know how long Okay
(52:29) long long time and the shooting industry has gravitated towards trying to train as many of them as possible because it's
(52:35) a huge Market that they can Pander to et cetera et cetera they're still not very good with them they're still to this day
(52:40) not most women still don't know how to  use a gun or the they really don't okay and if this is always
(52:46) going to be the case even the mechanism for using the gun using like Destiny's semi-automatic block right I bet his
(52:54) wife has trouble cocking the slide most people's wives do again this is uh like
(53:00) hyperbole Destiny but I'm just saying all of these things still require some
(53:05) fundamental strength to do and no I don't agree that technology is taking away from the fact that the equalization
(53:11) of force is not a possibility
(53:16) um I think so in Destiny's like as we get further further away from a survival scenario the possibility of Equalization
(53:24) might be there but it's not about it's not possible because men are still more assertive is that would that be a fair
(53:30) characterization no I think it's more fundamental than that but I think that you understand what I'm saying but I just think it's a
(53:37) it's even more there's more of a grounding there in the presupposition which is yes they're more assertive and
(53:43) that's I think that that's part of why they're necessary towards the enforcement but I think ultimately it
(53:48) really comes down to physical strength bone density structure all of these
(53:53) different things and that becomes the requirement for why there can't really be every egalitarianism I mean you're
(53:59) always dealing with a force which is monumentally more powerful than you are
(54:05) uh yeah no I still disagree with that I think that you go it goes back to you just comparing it to the the enforce of
(54:12) men with the physical strength I think that in this desire that we do live in and that this side we're moving towards you it isn't just the physical physical
(54:18) strength that I think it will be quite a galitarian I think it will be like a 50 50 I think there is a sense of IQ
(54:23) whoever you marry a woman or whoever you're with there's a complimentary factor that isn't just sourced around
(54:30) just like physical strength so I completely you're talking about men choosing women because of their IQ
(54:36) well I just feel like if he's saying that it's just a physical strength as far as enforcing laws and rules so so
(54:42) let's Angel just so we can make it clear so let's just say assertiveness aggressiveness then there's like
(54:48) physical strength right these are all different things you can still be assertive and aggressive and not be very physically as strong you can also be
(54:54) very physically strong and not assertive or aggressive but my point is men on gen on average because they have 17 times as
(55:01) much testosterone as women on average are going to be more assertive right they're going to step into situations
(55:07) they're going to be more aggressive and they're going to be physically stronger therefore as we get into like this Blank
(55:13) Slate Society where anyone can have any job men are still going to prefer having jobs in the Infantry as Engineers
(55:21) um and take certain uh like uh uh jobs as far as politicians because their bodies are equipped for it right yeah
(55:27) because because from an evolutionary standpoint they're equipped for that that's essentially what we're saying is
(55:32) even though as we get further and further away from a survival scenario the possibility of a woman taking more
(55:37) and more of these occupations exists it still isn't going to happen on average because men are more aggressive in a
(55:43) certain uh sure I think that men are aggressive and assertive in many ways evolutionary
(55:49) sure but I don't see them doing that if there's no reason to do it if if if there's no one to do it for I hate to
(55:55) say it I know and you disagree with me but I do it now man can collectively and
(56:00) do a nation so they just snap their fingers and women's rights are gone they can't do yeah but half in the
(56:05) morning when going to school or working so what does that have to do with anything I just said meaning why would
(56:10) they even join to go to the military you're not listening to me listen very closely what I'm saying
(56:16) men in Nations right this second as we speak have just said collectively women
(56:22) have no rights and women can't do about that you understand that sure okay so that
(56:28) that shows you that basically any by the way anywhere on planet Earth in history that this has ever happened where men
(56:34) collectively say you have no rights women don't have any and they can't do anything about it the opposite is not
(56:40) true for men men can collectively say you have no more rights to another group of men and those men can do something
(56:46) about that women can't wait what are you talking about men have oppressed other men throughout all of human history they
(56:52) have but other men can collectively do something back you and you you can go back to Spartacus in the Gladiator war
(56:59) with Rome and you can go to all these different uh uh you know slave rebellions which happen all of these
(57:04) things which are men being oppressed by other men and those men being able to fight back there is no such example for
(57:10) women ever I believe you live in a democracy I don't really see that happening I don't
(57:16) see those progressing back in time so I see an extreme hypothetical but I don't see how that's realistic but men but if
(57:21) men decide we don't have democracy anymore we don't yeah and I don't think but if women decide we don't have a
(57:26) democracy anymore and men decide we do we still will that's the distinction I don't think you can still have a
(57:32) democracy of half your Society doesn't want to participate what are they going to do about it they can stop voting they
(57:37) could stop somebody in a million different ways what do you mean I mean you could still have a democracy where only men were allowed to vote
(57:43) democratically that would still be a democracy I guess in Andrew's world it would be okay no in every world that would be
(57:52) democracy doesn't imply half your population for immutable characteristics aren't voting yeah well democracy just
(57:59) implies that there's a democratic process it there's all sorts of people right now who can't vote children can't
(58:04) vote Destiny are we not a real democracy I I think that most people today it's
(58:10) like it's a cute example I guess yeah also dead people can't vote um it's a good example but like I think that if we had a society where like black people or
(58:17) Mexicans or people over a certain height weren't allowed to vote I think people would question the Integrity of that democracy well maybe but that wouldn't
(58:23) make it not a democracy okay by definition that if you would restrict voting to just people with the last name
(58:28) Kennedy that would also be a type of democracy yes it would I agree okay thank you most people would if you had a
(58:35) nation that was based where all your laws were based on uh you know the Democratic Rule and only X percentage of
(58:41) the population could vote let's say they had to do military service first like Germany had that policy for a while if
(58:47) you had to do x amount of military service in order to vote would you say that that's not a real democracy
(58:54) for I didn't even listen what you said I'm sorry what I asked if you had to do military service in order to vote which has been
(59:01) done in Nations before that's not a democracy I want to know the answer
(59:08) in today's society if we would restrict voting just to people that were in the military I think yes I think people
(59:13) would question the Integrity of our democracy I think the Democratic standards worldwide have evolved significantly since whatever year it was
(59:19) where only military-going people could vote Yes so that wouldn't be a real democracy yeah hang on hang on we're
(59:25) getting way off topic I want to redirect this initial topic I think Michael said you want to say something so go ahead Michael uh no I think again I'm I I feel
(59:33) like I'm playing uh Reginald Denny here the uh the thing that Andrew's saying is that yes before women have this have
(59:40) suffrage in the United States it was still a representative democracy here and Destiny is saying the standards have
(59:45) evolved to where any normal liberal democracy should always allow women to vote so both things can be true uh but
(59:52) but what he's saying is that the standards have changed now and so even though Iraq before we invaded in 1990 or
(59:59) in 2003 women weren't able to vote they would still consider themselves a democracy even though they weren't really a democracy
(1:00:06) why wouldn't they have been a democracy because in reality uh Saddam Hussein was was doctoring all of the votes well in
(1:00:12) that okay so in that instance yeah I agree but let's say that it was legitimate where it was just the men who
(1:00:17) were allowed to vote and not the women not be a democracy I don't know I agree with you so it's a legitimately
(1:00:23) legitimately let's say the 1700s and the 1800s the United States that would be a democracy where women were not able to
(1:00:29) vote yeah but it was a legitimate democracy correct correct what Destiny is saying is now we've evolved as a
(1:00:36) society um to where that's a standard to where you know we don't find that except it
(1:00:41) may be fun I mean I've heard you say before an alligator she's been trying to talk for like a few minutes
(1:00:48) no I I was just gonna say like not on the whole democracy topic because I quite frankly think that's dumb to argue
(1:00:54) like what constitutes as a democracy when you can just look up the definition but um I for those who like believe in
(1:01:01) that in egalitarian society can function if you think every man and every woman
(1:01:06) in the workforce today switched roles would Society be able to function as
(1:01:12) efficiently as it's functioning now and I don't think it's functioning the most efficiently now but or would you see a
(1:01:17) genuine decrease in functionality of this like our society right now you
(1:01:22) would see a genuine decrease if you did any switch like that if all black people and white people
(1:01:29) switch jobs yes you would see a decrease if all Asian people if all short people and tall people if all Democrats and
(1:01:35) Republicans switch jobs yeah you would literally see a decrease in these pictures Society yes that is true
(1:01:42) so if you took a black nurse and a white nurse or no if you took a black person and a white person right they had
(1:01:48) different jobs and you switched their jobs like forget about degrees if you gave them the same degrees the same like
(1:01:53) if you took all the nurses that lived in Detroit and swapped them with all the nurses that lived in Baltimore you'd have an inefficiency so like what any
(1:01:59) sort of change like that would cause a massive inefficiency okay I don't necessarily think so maybe maybe you're right look you're right listen if if all
(1:02:06) tank infantry commanders all of a sudden became women would that cause an inefficiency yeah I certainly agree that
(1:02:12) that was forget about like yeah but at the same time but at the same time I
(1:02:17) flew with some like a few like three or four excellent female pilots and I flew with the majority of the excellent
(1:02:22) Pilots I flew with were men that doesn't mean there aren't some women that were good Pilots there are some there's some that are outside the standards yeah I
(1:02:29) never said a woman can't do these things right but you imply that a theoretical world where everyone is equal would
(1:02:36) function just as well but Destiny's not arguing that I don't think anybody
(1:02:42) all right all right guys I kind of got off topic
(1:02:47) with the whole democracy thing I thought we were still I think we should move on to the next topic uh I'll give everyone uh closing
(1:02:54) thoughts so just go ahead and make uh you know take a minute or two make your closing thoughts and move on to the next topic I think the chat is saying that
(1:03:01) you know it's kind of becoming a little circular so uh you want to start it off Angela since you're first in the order
(1:03:06) yeah um I do believe that Society is evolving and is changing and like Malik said you can make it whatever you want
(1:03:12) it to be and everybody can do whatever job they're good at and uh yeah patriarchy sucks so that's it okay
(1:03:18) Andrew well patriarchy sucks she certainly hasn't made a case for it tonight nobody else has either they haven't even made a
(1:03:25) single argument for the dispute of the use of force whatsoever uh or the foundation Destiny made this bizarre
(1:03:32) claim it's not even that important to society I made a compelling argument it's probably one of the most important
(1:03:37) key factors of society uh not only that Angela's arguments were well really she
(1:03:43) didn't really have any arguments it was just mostly like well women but women go to school and stuff and it's like yeah
(1:03:51) it's closing statements all right it's all right and interrupt you guys but it's like sorry sorry like oh hey you
(1:03:57) know uh women go to school and stuff and you know girls are just rocking it it's like well that really doesn't tell very
(1:04:04) much of the story over the tale here and the truth is is that an egalitarian society is not possible regardless of if
(1:04:11) you think that it requires 100 participation for it to be democracy or not egalitarianism is not a possibility
(1:04:18) it's not ever going to happen pipe dream it's a fantasy and you can't move past the fact that the enforcement mechanism
(1:04:24) was required is always going to be male and it's always going to be predominantly male so your rights are always going to come from men whether
(1:04:30) you like it or not Angela so okay Michael uh yeah my the original point was as we
(1:04:37) move further and further away like if we go back to uh like say the founding More Country 1776 I think in that case men
(1:04:43) are going to have to perform laborious jobs they're going to have to provide protection and Security in that case you
(1:04:49) uh you have a necessity for a patriarchy and men are also more assertive aggressive and physically stronger as we
(1:04:55) move further and further away from that agrarian society and further and further away from a survival scenario women have
(1:05:02) the opportunity to step up in different places in the workplace but even though they have the opportunity in general men
(1:05:08) are still going to have a lot of those jobs because they are genetically more aggressive they're more assertive and
(1:05:14) they're physically stronger so even though we may live in a place where like again there's this story I've read before women in Sweden where things are
(1:05:21) very very egalitarian are still looking for more masculine men they still even though they have the ability to go and
(1:05:26) have as much free sex as they want they still are looking more and more of those women are looking to get married because our genetics could have lead us down
(1:05:32) this path and so because of that I still think men are going to live we're going to still live in a patriarchy because
(1:05:38) men are more certain okay destiny uh yeah I just nobody analyzes the
(1:05:44) society this way nobody looks at countries this way it's like so unbelievably reductionist that it's like the point is bordering on unfalsifiable
(1:05:50) I don't know if there's ever been a movement in all of human history where it was only men against only men and
(1:05:55) women or only men like generally men and women even when there is a hierarchy are working together to some extent and um
(1:06:01) yeah the claim that like men could take all the rights from women and oppress them and women can't it's like like I
(1:06:07) can't even it's not even like I can point to other societies that didn't have women or had only women it's just such a weird claim and nobody measures
(1:06:13) the success of any country well you do measure the success of country by participation of different genders and generally as women participate more
(1:06:19) especially economically and reproductively meaning more Reproductive Rights that's generally when those societies begin to thrive more but yeah
(1:06:25) I think it's a funnily reductive way to analyze Society okay last up now
(1:06:36) true Malik your time to shine yeah so um
(1:06:42) I think patriarchy is the only possible way for a society to function efficiently
(1:06:47) um yes theoretically women can do any job a man is doing but I don't see why
(1:06:53) they would want to when men can just get better and same with jobs that require nurturing and all that like women
(1:07:00) just do it better so why should we have a society where we abolish gender roles
(1:07:06) and have people doing roles that they're not the best at when we could just have
(1:07:11) a world where people do things they're good at um but yeah I guess like theoretically
(1:07:17) like women could do a man can do  but I I just think that's that's stupid and
(1:07:22) um I do like that we're getting to a more Progressive point where um men are able to choose if they want
(1:07:29) to do um a woman's job or a man's job yes I use this terms if you're offended that's a you problem
(1:07:36) um and I forgot my last Point um oh yeah but women only want women only
(1:07:43) want to be masculine and women only want to take on roles that are traditionally done by men until it's that they
(1:07:50) don't want to do like woman only want to be masculine when they have the option to woman would never want to get drafted
(1:07:58) woman would never want to be septic tank cleaners woman would never
(1:08:03) want to do the dirty grungy work that they're going to come home every day with a sore
(1:08:09) back because they've been carrying scaffolding all day up and down Hills like women aren't going to want to do
(1:08:14) that like men do that because if they don't do it no one will like women only like doing that when they have the
(1:08:19) choice I feel like all right and I personally like being in the kitchen all right anyway let's move on to the
(1:08:26) next topic this has actually got the most uploads uh by far so it seems like people really care about this so this is
(1:08:32) this is the proposition male depression is an all-time high men are committing suicide and record numbers why is this
(1:08:39) happening and what are potential Solutions and uh for this one
(1:08:45) um yeah I guess we'll we'll do opening statements again uh Angela you can go let's keep it a minute or less though
(1:08:50) let's keep it quick oh wait sorry what was it again bro I'll just repeat it uh male
(1:08:57) depression is an all-time high and then it committing suicide and record numbers why is this happening like why are men
(1:09:02) more depressed nowadays in the war and what are some potential Solutions uh I believe that the depression is at
(1:09:09) the all-time high because we're still heavily dependent on the patriarchy system for men to operate in the society
(1:09:14) where it isn't just fully functioning for them to just be back labor mammals I guess um I believe that we don't teach men how
(1:09:21) to express themselves and how to navigate through the society we live in now being that we're driven with
(1:09:26) technology AIS and all that crap not just I don't know changing the oil rigs and all that stuff
(1:09:33) um there's no space that men are creating with each other to actually have Solutions instead of just pandering
(1:09:38) to each other Andrew well that was the most absurd that
(1:09:43) I ever heard in my life but other than that other than that being completely absurd and making no sense whatsoever I
(1:09:50) think that the reason that you see the male suicide rate so high and by the way you have to break this down a little bit
(1:09:56) better because there's actually demographics of males where the suicidality is much less than other
(1:10:03) demographics of males so I think it has to be broken down uh this way but generally I think it's due to the fact
(1:10:09) that we've kind of moved more towards a gynocentric society we've started to move this way there's been kind of a
(1:10:15) great con that has been put on men's backs and that they're starting to recognize uh and but they've essentially
(1:10:21) been treated like for I don't know about 50 years or so and you can see the
(1:10:27) uh the kind of suicide numbers reflect this a bit so as you're kind of looking at this scale in this Arc which has
(1:10:34) happened you start to recognize that you know divorce is pitted against them all of these different things are pitted
(1:10:40) against them and then you have this really key fundamental factor which is that nobody gives a about men
(1:10:45) including other men now we are competitive by Nature we're always going to be competitive by nature
(1:10:50) and I would expect to see the suicidality of men be higher than it is for women I I would expect to see that
(1:10:57) uh due to that kind of ontological nature which we have so I think that
(1:11:02) also another thing which which people forget about in this conversation often is that men are just better at it so
(1:11:08) when they take the final solution they make sure it's final because they know how to use guns and things like this they make sure that it's over whereas
(1:11:15) women when they make these attempts they use pills things that won't damage the face all of these different types of
(1:11:21) things so this is uh more than just a singular answer this is more nuanced than it has complexity to it so I'm
(1:11:27) happy to get into it Michael yeah Andrew took a part of my point so men and women on average do attempt suicide at similar
(1:11:35) rates now when we're talking about 40 year old men who are divorced that's a much higher level but men tend to commit
(1:11:40) suicide more because they use guns and ropes and balconies and women tend to use uh slitting of the wrists and and
(1:11:46) pills I don't know if we can say this all the stuff on YouTube yeah that tends to be the reason why now
(1:11:52) going back to what you said before I'm going to go back to to my original statement before as we get further and further like if the majority of The
(1:11:58) Human Experience let's just say 300 000 years of human experience has been humans in survival scenarios and things
(1:12:04) that that aided in survival would lead to rewarding and things that uh that we're not aiding in survival would lead
(1:12:10) to like say depression as we get further and further away from a survival scenario and we get our gratification from things that don't cause us to uh
(1:12:16) accomplish goals or don't accomplish us to move our bodies we just sit there and like again I play a ton of video games
(1:12:22) but play video games watch pornography things like that as we get further and further away from a survival scenario
(1:12:27) we're not accomplishing goals and thus by not accomplishing those goals we get further and further into depression we
(1:12:33) get further and further away from our Natural State and that's what that's why I believe the increase in depression especially with men it's concerned and
(1:12:39) that also men being zeroed out after divorce destiny
(1:12:46) um yeah I I feel like um I feel like men have a really hard time like sorting themselves out emotionally
(1:12:52) especially later on in life I think like the highest age for suicides I think it's like the 40 to 60 demographic of I
(1:12:58) think for white men are like the highest at risk and I think a lot of the times it's because um it might be because they're divorced
(1:13:04) um it might be just because they're lonely but like kids are out of the house they don't have any friends they don't know how to reach out and talk to anybody and then men have a really hard
(1:13:09) time asking for help uh because I think like I think like 40 of them say that it's like too embarrassing to do so or
(1:13:15) that like they figured it out on their own they don't want anybody to help them so I think that um I think that men are
(1:13:20) kind of really in a rough shape when it comes to emotionally navigating the world I don't know how we can blame it on feminism or anything else but it
(1:13:27) seems like men have always been predisposed towards higher suicidality than women I believe oh and seems like
(1:13:32) uh yeah I go with that one Alec
(1:13:38) yeah so ultimately it's kind of men's fault men don't support other men men
(1:13:44) don't blend an open ear to other men when men are down if a man goes to another man
(1:13:50) and says like hey I'm depressed hey I'm going through it's week hit the gym like soy boy hit the gym
(1:13:58) like get off get off of PornHub like and they don't like men don't help other men
(1:14:03) going through issues and because it hurts a man's ego to go to a woman
(1:14:10) who and women often are supportive but men almost never turn to a woman for emotional support because men have an
(1:14:16) ego issue if men were more supportive to other men and men had less of a
(1:14:21) ego I think that men would be able to get the help they need and in addition to that
(1:14:27) um uh Andrew brought up the point that like when men commit suicide versus woman
(1:14:33) committing suicide a lot of times men just do it better like that sounds really up to say but it's true
(1:14:40) and then the final point would be why is it at record high numbers you have social media you have all these these
(1:14:47) red pilled and like all the social media where a depressed single man is at home goes on his phone is just scrolling
(1:14:54) through these billionaires with these super cards with these models and thinking I will never have that what is
(1:14:59) the point of living no girl wants me I'm miserable I'm fat I'm overweight I'm not fit I will never be attractive like that
(1:15:05) and they feel like there's no hope and they don't want to go to therapy because it's frowned upon they don't reach out to their friends because
(1:15:11) they'll get bullied for it I just think um if men were more I don't know
(1:15:17) supportive to other men I don't think we'd see that much of an issue and I don't I personally don't know what to do
(1:15:23) to change that because men have been like this for decades and decades and decades open Panel has have added guys
(1:15:30) and girls um yeah well I guess that's one thing that women can do we can emotionally
(1:15:37) express ourselves so we don't want to commit suicide first so I guess we finally figured out what women are good at so it would be
(1:15:44) wait what yeah because we sit here and say that um men commit suicide and they're say it
(1:15:50) again Malik no no this is a question for you this was yours
(1:15:56) you don't think that it's because you know women tend to like take pills and things like that that are less effective
(1:16:02) than men no I think of them today I think what men will do is they'll literally put a weapon in their mouth
(1:16:07) and pull the trigger so there's absolutely no chance that there's going to be a failure and women don't try to
(1:16:13) do that so I don't even understand this argument that you're making can you pleasure my argument is that men don't
(1:16:20) at least speak about their issues you don't talk about it so what do you do you go straight to action which is you
(1:16:25) just want to commit the actual action of suicide with women we at least talk about it we think about our kids we think about our family we think about it
(1:16:31) then why are they attempting it at the same rates and just men are more effective that's the question that's a
(1:16:36) big hole in your argument it's a cry for help it's a cry for help is it a cry for help or is it because if you if you look
(1:16:43) at what Undertakers and people like this say women don't want to damage their face there's a big thing with the fit it
(1:16:49) literally I don't know why but they don't actually want to damage their face when they they have an open casket funeral things like this so they tend to
(1:16:56) not and also because they don't usually own guns they don't tend to utilize guns
(1:17:01) for suicide don't you think that that's a better explanation I don't think I this might sound mean I don't I wish I
(1:17:07) could find research about because I would like if you're a woman and you take like eight pills I don't think you're trying to kill yourself I think
(1:17:13) if you want to kill yourself I think you'll kill yourself I feel like it's more of a personality disorder what like borderline personality disorder
(1:17:19) sure Cry for Help sure yeah I I think um yeah I I don't think that I don't think
(1:17:25) that if you try to OD using pills I don't think you're as committed to it as you could be that's
(1:17:32) yeah so going back to men not expressing their emotions they don't talk about it they don't create spaces for it Angela
(1:17:40) can I ask you a question so a lot of the times if you were to say why is it these men are actually committing suicide you
(1:17:46) were to ask them a lot of them it's financially being zeroed out so that's one of the things where if I'm in that
(1:17:51) situation and I maybe I do want to talk about my feelings it doesn't make the problem go away and 86 of the time
(1:17:57) Primary Care is given to the woman after a divorce and so now I've lost my
(1:18:02) children and I've lost a lot of money it's not saying that it's a justification for committing suicide but
(1:18:08) a lot of times feelings don't have anything to do with it and that's the reason why they would commit suicide it's not necessarily that they're not
(1:18:13) talking about their feelings enough does that make sense yeah that just might be an alternate hypothesis hold on real
(1:18:19) quick your example kind of defeated itself because you're saying that the reason why women don't commit suicide as
(1:18:25) much after divorce is because so many people console them so it seems like it literally is because of their feelings
(1:18:30) no uh well I mean women aren't committing suicide because they're getting
(1:18:36) financially zeroed out because the acquisition of resources maybe means something different to them I don't know like I think I think for a man he kind
(1:18:42) of comes with realization it's like my value and my worth throughout my entire life and by the way I'm not saying this is right it comes from how much I can
(1:18:49) produce and how productive I am and so now I've lost all that maybe a lot of suicides happened after the uh the crash
(1:18:55) of 2000 the crash of 08. you saw a an increase in the number of suicides then and then additionally with men are being
(1:19:01) awarded or women are being awarded custody one and a half standard deviations about 86 of the time then
(1:19:06) that would require that would mean that they're far likely to suffer from the depression or if they're if they're the
(1:19:11) ones with primary custody far less likely to commit suicide when they're the primary caregiver of a child
(1:19:18) let me just start just to kind of put things in perspective so men have always historically committed suicide a little
(1:19:23) bit more than women right well as you can see it was pretty close and then in the 60s 70s something started to happen
(1:19:28) where women suicide rate stayed the same and men just Skyrock right so the I mean
(1:19:34) one of the things we're discussing is what exactly happened what caused the suicide
(1:19:44) um I I was responding to something that um that was being said I don't but now we just said that I don't know what happened
(1:19:51) I was just trying to do something Michael said I don't remember what we're responding to though talking about feelings and not
(1:19:57) committing suicide oh yeah I think yeah I was gonna say like a guy a guy that gets divorced shouldn't kill himself
(1:20:02) right there's probably some level of counseling or therapy that could help there I don't think that's like an inevitability that like if you sure yeah
(1:20:07) get divorced you have to kill yourself but I think that men I think that women have an easier time asking for help versus men yeah
(1:20:14) yeah that's men's fault that's what yeah men's fault okay
(1:20:21) I'm asking for help because if a woman goes to another woman and says hey I'm depressed and suicidal whatever that
(1:20:28) woman will typically listen and offer whatever support they can or encourage their friend to get help even if it's a
(1:20:34) stranger if a man goes to another man and expresses he's mentally not okay
(1:20:39) nine out of ten times he's gonna be made fun of and bullied for it
(1:20:45) how long Alex have you done this Destiny have you guys ever talked to a friend of yours from committing suicide this is
(1:20:51) really rough and I think we're bad at this that's a really bad question for actually thank you Destiny's told his
(1:20:58) friends to kill themselves when they've told him well not actually but even um I
(1:21:03) would say Michael I think you me and Alex are probably bad for this because if I had to guess if I had to guess
(1:21:08) probably most men like over the age of 30 are going to take those conversations
(1:21:13) really seriously I don't know how seriously they're going to take those conversations in high school you know
(1:21:19) like I think that if you're a guy over 25 or 30 and you bully your friends you are legitimately a sociopathic piece of
(1:21:25) who should have your like throat cut but if you're a guy that bullies your friends and you're in high school you're probably like a normal dude you
(1:21:32) know whereas I don't know if that same like level of virtual even towards friends I feel like it's probably enforced more by Men At an earlier age I
(1:21:38) could be wrong on that but that's like just a guess my hope is that like any guy over 30. normal for men because
(1:21:43) that's how we play it exactly that's what we do with each other like even like like guys yeah
(1:21:48) that's why the depression and suicide rates are higher like like I said it's a it's a man's problem
(1:21:54) like sounds like it sounds like you're making an argument for toxic masculinity Malik true it is toxic masculinity
(1:22:03) Seven Brothers I have seven brothers and I'm very close with all of them so I
(1:22:09) barely am familiar with how men think and their their mindsets towards things
(1:22:14) and so many men are just so quick to just attack someone for being either
(1:22:20) down or lesser than Society expects and it's like I I never see men like okay
(1:22:25) sometimes you see it but like the majority of the time when a man is down other men because they're competitive by
(1:22:32) Nature they will try to get higher up and leave that man in the dirt or push them even lower to get higher up in life
(1:22:38) like men don't yeah but balance together but it isn't part of the stoic nature of
(1:22:43) men and all of that hazing that also leads to a quality that nobody talks about which is bravery could it be
(1:22:50) possible of all that some of this could be accounted for with the fact that men will actually follow through with this
(1:22:56) because they're braver than women I don't think there's anything Brave hold on
(1:23:01) anything Brave about committing suicide think that's bravery wait I I think suicide you don't well you don't think
(1:23:07) you can do it I don't think well these are nice These are nice platitudes but most people don't lean towards
(1:23:14) self-termination and there has to be some kind of aspect of follow-through to actually do that now I you can you can
(1:23:20) make the arguments mental illness or any number of different things fine but could there be an aspect that part of
(1:23:26) this hazing and part of the kind of stoic nature which is men would lead them do this just because they have the
(1:23:31) follow through to do so but I I personally will never excuse suicide
(1:23:37) or or try to make a justification for it suicide is quitting it's giving up on life it's throwing in the towel it's
(1:23:44) being a coward and it's being a person to everyone in your life it's literally one of the worst things you
(1:23:50) can do um so I think that I don't know try to justify like why the reason so Malik
(1:23:57) Malik when when samurais did sefuku and they like opened their their bow you know killed themselves
(1:24:04) don't even answer that question that's just a stupid comparison why is that a bad comparison
(1:24:12) ritual suicide killing for the honor of your Chieftain or whatever is different than somebody that's like
(1:24:17) depressed and hopeless and killed himself because they have nothing else in life going on for them yeah so if you're looking at the suicidality in
(1:24:23) Japan you're gonna chop that up to uh cultural distinction of them wanting to keep their honor intact I'm sorry you
(1:24:29) think people in Japan that commit suicide are doing it because they view it as seppuku no I'm agreeing with you that there's at least some type of
(1:24:36) um like cultural distinction which leads them to think that there's at least some kind of Honor that's kept intact by
(1:24:43) their suicide be it some shame that they brought on their family I don't agree you're literally like well what do you
(1:24:49) what do you think the distinction well what do you think the distinction is and why do you think that there's such a high suicidality rate there because they
(1:24:56) have all the things masculine it's not brave it's not anything positive yeah I don't care about the virtue signaling I
(1:25:02) just ask the biggest logic question because I'm pretty sure don't they have a whole bunch more predictors for things for why people would want to kill
(1:25:08) themselves their psychological and mental health is worse they stay together with their parents longer they don't move out as quickly their job
(1:25:14) prospects aren't as good they're lonely they don't like men don't know how to talk to women or get dates like they're very like isolated emotionally from each
(1:25:20) other they don't go and talk to each other much like aren't these all things that are big predictors of society but there's also the predictor of Honor
(1:25:26) there's an honorific which is there I'm sorry show me that show me that and a lot of times where is the honorific I
(1:25:31) actually I actually can there's left behind in suicide notes they brought shame to their family sometimes just for
(1:25:37) something as simple as not graduating high school which are endlessly shamed for in society for doing it's part of
(1:25:42) the honor culture which is there you don't think that it takes some amount of follow-through for the culture or some
(1:25:48) amount of Bravery to do this no I think that yeah well I think it does ultimately yeah I think it does now I'm
(1:25:54) not saying that it's optimal I think it should be discouraged at every turn but I think it's silly to think that men uh
(1:26:02) can outperform women on being able to you know in their own life if you didn't bring in that they had some kind of
(1:26:09) follow-through that women didn't have on this I think that it all boils down to communication and we talk about like the
(1:26:15) aftermath of what men do after divorces I think that we don't talk about how to prevent these issues as far as like the
(1:26:21) lack of communication leading up to the divorce as to why I felt like you needed to put a gun in his mouth and end his life
(1:26:27) I mean men don't communicate their emotions and Michael you said earlier as yeah so here's the distinction actually
(1:26:32) because Destiny asked and the distinction is the studies that I'm looking at show that in the west it's
(1:26:38) divorce and family court for men which is the number one kind of cited reason
(1:26:43) for uh for these deaths but not in Japan that's not the case in Japan because
(1:26:49) they're not even getting married but keep in mind that it could be the same reason right so firstly it's hard to
(1:26:55) figure out a reason for suicide because a guy that kills us can't really tell you why he did it right like a tempest but however when you say divorce or or
(1:27:03) uh marriage court or whatever are they killing themselves because they got divorced or are they killing themselves because they're alone and they have
(1:27:08) nobody to talk to or be with now well I think and so in Japan when you kill yourself because you can't even get out of the house to find a significant other
(1:27:14) or you're lonely your whole life a guy that hasn't even been married might kill himself for the exact same reason a divorce man kills himself it's I mean
(1:27:21) it's possible but the thing is is like let's look at these distinguishing factors here well you would agree with
(1:27:26) me that we have two very distinctive societies between Western society and Japanese society when you're looking at
(1:27:33) the these types of distinctions if you're looking at the studies showing divorce family court and the citations
(1:27:40) there and we also have the suicide notes left behind I think that we can make a distinction here that there are cultural
(1:27:46) distinctions for why people do this and this does seem to allude to the evidence
(1:27:51) that here the depression comes maybe from loneliness and things like that as opposed to shame where it might come in
(1:27:57) other demographic areas that's what I'm saying so it doesn't but the cultural differences don't really matter because
(1:28:03) the common denominator in men committing suicide is men feeling depressed like
(1:28:09) they have no other option they they feel too embarrassed or whatever to go and get help and at the end of the day it
(1:28:15) just comes down to men needing to wait a minute
(1:28:20) so you think that this is broadly cross-cultural then where men just refuse to do this maybe it's part of our
(1:28:26) nation I think I think I think yes it's part of our nature maybe I think it's a
(1:28:32) social conditioning like when you tell someone Angela yeah that's a great question like
(1:28:39) why we look historically men have not had the ability to communicate their feelings as well as women throughout
(1:28:45) history so it's probably not a cultural thing it's probably a genetic thing when we talked before about being stoic right
(1:28:50) not only does stoicism something that men look to other men and say Hey you know like the Clint Eastwood type of stoicism uh they look at those men as
(1:28:58) being more High status women also reward that type of behavior and because of that men are less likely to share their
(1:29:03) feelings that's just one of the reasons why and you know there are probably other reasons why but the answer is
(1:29:09) probably more it's in a man's nature it's in his genetics for him to not be as good at sharing his feelings as women
(1:29:15) are no right part of the nature that's what I'm alluding to is that there must be some part of the nature if it's
(1:29:20) cross-cultural and you still see a heightened level among men I would think this would be part of you know something
(1:29:27) which is man's nature now I think maybe it's arguable which aspects and I don't disagree with Destiny 100 that there's
(1:29:34) not social qualifiers for this obviously there are we have the reported reasons for it but I do think that there is a
(1:29:41) nature to men and a nature to women which is distinctly different and part of that nature is that yeah I think
(1:29:47) because we have this aggressive nature things like this we have the follow-through for that
(1:29:52) and I think it's also Men by Nature are leaders Men by Nature are competitive Men by Nature want to have status and
(1:30:00) and be on top and I think when men don't achieve that um they are extremely hard on themselves
(1:30:06) to the point where sometimes they just give up and end it I don't think Men by Nature are going to commit suicide more I think
(1:30:14) just Men by Nature have like take ego like way more seriously and take status
(1:30:19) and all that way more seriously that women do so when they you can't separate one from the other you can't you can't
(1:30:25) take that it's like that is the essence of male that is an essence of maleness you can't no it's okay I guess you would
(1:30:32) commit would commit suicide less because they are committing suicide more and have always that's the reason why yeah
(1:30:37) okay so I guess men and women were not in a vacuum yeah yeah you could you could make that
(1:30:43) statement um and I think the solution to that is just that
(1:30:48) men need to support men better and have a group of the ego complex where if
(1:30:54) you're not number one with with a sports car and a hot girl by age 25 or 26 or if
(1:31:02) your wife divorces you you don't have to end it like you can get help you can get support like you don't always have to be
(1:31:08) number one and I think that the competitive nature is yeah but I mean I I so I don't
(1:31:15) disagree with everything you're saying but don't you think that you know really the Outreach towards men's support is
(1:31:21) that that's a pretty recent thing where there has really been any type of Outreach towards men's issues men's
(1:31:28) rights issues second maybe the last decade where it's even become prominent at all uh in my lifetime anyway so this
(1:31:35) is kind of a new thing that we're we're dealing with isn't it well it's hard to reach out for immense issues because as
(1:31:40) soon as you start talking about it like a lot of the leaders in the mint Community like push back against it
(1:31:45) right like the quote-unquote leaders in men's communities right now for like red pill type people are going to tell you
(1:31:51) that emotions are gay and they're going to tell you that talking about your feelings is a guy makes you a loser they're gonna say if you cry in front of a girl she's gonna leave you
(1:31:57) instantly like on that fresh and fit unofficial subreddit half that subreddit spent like two weeks roasting Myron
(1:32:02) because he cried a little bit when his YouTube channel got demonetized which is probably like one of the most traumatizing things that he's probably
(1:32:07) ever experienced in his life so like I mean yeah I mean it's not it's not surprising that it's hard to talk about these issues when either women have to
(1:32:13) talk about them which let's be real as men we don't want to hear women talk about our experiences and then when we look to men to talk about them they
(1:32:18) basically say that we're weaker or losers or whatever for having a emotional wait a second wait a second let me push back a little bit on this
(1:32:24) because I think that that's an absurd statement I think that all of those things stoicism and these types of
(1:32:29) things that is good advice from these red pill leaders now you might say well wait a second when we talk about these
(1:32:36) things they're roasting these guys incessantly for crying and this kind of thing I think it's because we've been
(1:32:41) told that it's not okay for us to in uh to lean into our nature so it's not okay
(1:32:47) for us to be stoic we need to be more emotional things like this and that's where the lack of support really comes
(1:32:53) in is from society at large saying no you need to not be so masculine you need
(1:32:58) to not do these things that that that's my counter to that Destiny well but it seems like the hyper masculinity is part
(1:33:04) of the problem that your refusal to talk to somebody or open up to somebody be vulnerable to somebody with a problem seems to be a big issue really like the
(1:33:12) number one toxic masculinity you mean yes yeah like it seems like one of the biggest uh predictors for being suicidal
(1:33:18) even in Japan is being isolated and depressed or I'm sorry being isolated um
(1:33:24) there's another word of something but like being isolated yeah that if you have nobody in your life you're yeah
(1:33:29) you're and that's going to be like one of your big predictors for actually killing yourself yeah I mean yeah yeah and also a
(1:33:36) predictor but but don't you think though that as the light has been shined on
(1:33:42) these men specific issues these are these are more tailored towards men that as kind of these thread pill leaders who
(1:33:48) I don't agree with a lot of what they say I come from a Christian standpoint but I do agree with a lot of the
(1:33:53) descriptions that they make of these problems that it is actually okay for men to embrace this kind of stoicism it
(1:34:00) is okay for us to be masculine not talk about our feelings things like this isn't it really a societal pushback
(1:34:06) which is causing that saying no you need to you you know it's not okay for you to be this way it's not okay to be a man
(1:34:12) it's not okay to be a masculine man about what you're talking about is literally the things that drive a lot of
(1:34:18) guys to Suicide I can't talk about this but I gotta be a man I need a man up I shouldn't be upset about these things I
(1:34:23) should just figure it out on my own like that seems to be the problem yeah but also let Michael get a word and after
(1:34:29) you're done okay go ahead no I was just gonna say before the uh when we we think about people who live
(1:34:36) 50 000 years ago their their daily routine was basically not quite on the level of starvation but
(1:34:43) they're on a survival scenario all the time there's no there's no money there's status is basically uh based on how much
(1:34:50) they can provide for their tribe in those type of situations depression doesn't creep in because their life is
(1:34:55) either survive or die and so in though you have those situations over and over again when those people don't have time
(1:35:01) to sit there and be introspective and look at other people on social media and compare themselves to cars and other
(1:35:07) people's girlfriends etc etc every day is kill the gazelle or family wait wait
(1:35:12) hang on there's a problem here though and this is why I'm given the pushback that I'm giving why do you see the
(1:35:18) suicidality rate so low in the 30s 40s 50s things
(1:35:23) as it's accelerated and no this was not a survival Tech you know we weren't
(1:35:29) hungry from the 50s this was this was a you know not at all and yet you see
(1:35:35) those rates significantly lower don't you think that this is because it was actually okay for you to be toxic or
(1:35:43) part of this toxic masculinity that that was viewed by societies being all right instead of all this pushback against it
(1:35:50) uh I don't know I I think I think you still are closer to a survival scenario before the Advent of broad spectrum
(1:35:56) antibiotics in the 1930s so like that's why I still think I'm talking about the 50s okay in the 50s maybe things are
(1:36:03) definitely a little different but we're still in agrarian culture until like maybe after World War II uh and so I
(1:36:09) think in those situations when you're in a situation where I got to get up and work every day I don't have time to compare myself to other people uh I
(1:36:15) think as time passes on once we get to the 1950s we have the Advent of Television around 1953 and then we later
(1:36:21) on we get into uh we start comparing ourselves to other people I think that's where the depression starts to happen
(1:36:27) usually when you go back and look at dunbar's number uh dunbar's uh the Anthropologist who had this idea that
(1:36:33) human societies were always 100 yes well I I might agree with some of that but again the pushback is even if that's
(1:36:39) true if it's the Advent of Television communication isn't a pushback on your
(1:36:45) the ideas that you have and the masculinity that you hold and things like this that's bad isn't that at the
(1:36:50) pushback you're talking about sure these things that could be it too but I also think like it's not necessarily like
(1:36:57) people going around and being like I need to be more masculine and more or more feminine or talk about my feelings I think it was one of the things that
(1:37:03) I've noticed is that when I when I went to basic training all the things I cared about before
(1:37:09) Air Force Air Force uh when I went to that that's not basic training that's what the OTS when I was in OTS when I
(1:37:16) was in OTS I remember about the survival school I went to Cedar school where they beat you and they throw you in a in a
(1:37:21) jail cell and they they keep you up for a couple days when I'm in those situations one of the things I remembered was that para rescue
(1:37:28) uh no I was uh it's uh Spokane Washington at Fairchild Air Force Base it's Sears school survival evasion
(1:37:35) reconnaissance and Escape yeah I thought that that was a prerequisite for para rescue I'm sorry yeah it is it is yeah
(1:37:40) correct yeah the repair rescue guys in our troop in our club okay guys back in 2004. So anyway uh in that situation I
(1:37:47) noticed all these things that were in my mind all these weird thoughts about uh how do I look and I didn't care about
(1:37:52) how I looked I didn't care about how I smelled I didn't care about talking to women I didn't care about what TV show was on I was back because those were
(1:37:58) okay it was all okay right it was yes that you should be that way because I
(1:38:04) had three Square meals in a place to sleep so then I could go previously and then debate who owns Twitter or who the
(1:38:10) next president is but I'm in a survival scenario all I care about is surviving getting away from Pain finding a
(1:38:15) comfortable place to sleep and finding food and the majority of human existence was that yeah but wasn't it as culture
(1:38:21) based around uh embracing your masculinity and embracing what are considered broadly
(1:38:28) now to be toxic features that is part of military culture and so of course of
(1:38:33) course if that's the case you as you as you see this uh wouldn't you agree with me then that a lot of this pushback
(1:38:39) maybe comes from all this telecommunication and things like I think it's pushing back against your nature what he's saying isn't like has
(1:38:45) nothing to do with mask it has nothing to do with anything relating to this topic what he's really saying is like on a broad level that like if you're in the
(1:38:51) rat race like every day and you wake up you work you do your or whatever it feels like really depressive thoughts
(1:38:57) relating to Suicide these are things that settle in when you've got a whole lot of free time and a whole lot of
(1:39:03) other people to compare yourself to and then a whole lot of life to compare your  to so for instance like again a lot
(1:39:08) of people think that the highest Fidelity is among like teenagers it's not it's like old men it's men that are sitting at home they might not be
(1:39:14) working anymore they've got no family anymore and they're just alone and bored and want to kill themselves but that if
(1:39:19) you've got you're doing every single day it's harder for that to set in yeah well I get the the argument that
(1:39:25) hey if you're not thinking about anything except whatever the pressing needs are you're not going to be thinking about suicidality I get that I
(1:39:32) understand that what I'm talking about is even in the 50s people had plenty of free time so why was the rate so much
(1:39:40) lower I think that there must have been some kind of cultural pushback I think back then in the 50s meant could
(1:39:48) not just have free time like Society has made everything they did have free time no they had records obviously they had
(1:39:55) some free time but nowadays you don't even need to grocery shop for yourself you can get ordered to
(1:40:01) your house you don't have to drive you can Uber you can live you can do whatever like Society has made it where
(1:40:06) people can be as lazy as they possibly want to it does come at a cost but you
(1:40:12) had to do a lot more back then like you had to like leave the house if you needed to get food you you today can
(1:40:18) just sit in bed all day and run order food to your house and I think
(1:40:24) the more you are doing absolutely nothing yeah and then you could have milk more opportunity I just don't feel
(1:40:29) like this is a good argument I think there's probably a lot more markers to success I said you said people were just
(1:40:35) as lazy back then as they are today and I'm saying this yeah I broadly think that that's true that's probably true but I don't think it's about laziness
(1:40:41) because it's about I think it's one is free time and the other is like comparisons to other people I think that
(1:40:46) like if you go way back so the technology pushes that though right yes don't you think yeah the tech well the
(1:40:51) technology and like the lifestyles that we're sold like it feels like broadly speaking it like prior to jeez what I
(1:40:57) don't know prior to like what the 70s or 80s like basically like have a family have a house like you do okay maybe get
(1:41:05) like the coolest whatever the car was being made back then and like that was it but now it feels like you've got social pressures that are pushing you
(1:41:11) every single microsecond of the day comparing you to every single other person around the entire world
(1:41:17) right like my guess is probably in like the 40s and 50s the average girl wanted to be as cool as like the best flapper
(1:41:23) or whatever the they were called it their local dance school or whatever whereas now like every single woman wants to be uh what like the Kardashian
(1:41:31) or the Kylie Jenner or not even I don't even know the the slugs are because I don't feel any but like people are comparing themselves I
(1:41:36) appreciate that yeah on an international level more than they
(1:41:42) ever have at every single moment of their life like a 15 year old girl knows what the prettiest girl in the world looks like and she's on her
(1:41:47) phone in front of her every single day you know uh and it's like yeah that type of pressure and stress and same thing with men too right
(1:41:53) like the average man like who did the average man look up to he's probably  Comic Book Heroes in the 50s and
(1:41:59) 60s and now the average manatees Andrew Tate as 75 Bugattis 76 and 77 houses he's like holy I'm such a
(1:42:05) loser you know yeah
(1:42:10) that then it's like going with that then you would
(1:42:17) say then it must be this kind of push towards societal materialism which is problematic and definitely a massive
(1:42:23) contributing factor right yeah it is but that's that push kind of like how I said earlier Society is gearing itself
(1:42:28) towards higher and higher IQ it's probably gearing itself to its higher and higher EQ as well you have to be able to resist more emotionally and
(1:42:35) psychologically which men aren't equipped well to do because traditionally men are equipped to work a
(1:42:40) job uh get a woman with your paycheck uh have sex and then just that's kind of all you have to do as a guy and the
(1:42:46) society is leveled up to where you need to be able to do way more mentally and emotionally and men don't have the training for that because our fathers
(1:42:53) didn't do it so they can't teach us to do it and men don't really like to learn those things from women so you're kind of just
(1:42:58) those societies were dealing with global war and all sorts of things we don't have to deal with at all where people
(1:43:05) were coming home in body bags they were definitely dealing with significant trauma maybe significant emotional
(1:43:11) problems that we don't even have to deal with now I'm not so sure that that's the answer man I'm gonna so this is gonna
(1:43:17) sound really cold but I think in a really roundabout way I think Wars aren't the worst thing for your Society
(1:43:22) I think Wars in some ways can even be positive no no I'm saying that you've got a
(1:43:28) common enemy everybody goes out and works everybody's got like a thing to build towards like it drives you forward
(1:43:34) to have an enemy I think that being at war with somebody and even if people are dying and even if it's horrible on a
(1:43:40) descriptive level being at war with somebody I think is a lot more mentally and psychologically endurable than every
(1:43:46) single day you wake up and you look at your cell phone and you see how poor you are you see how many you don't have you see how much your job sucks you
(1:43:52) see how many student loans you have you say I think that's way more mentally graded but when you're saying no no no I mean you're seeing your buddies getting
(1:43:58) shot going I'm not talking about an actual veteran with PTSD most people in the United
(1:44:04) States did not fight in World War II yeah but a lot of almost nobody was unaffected by it no no your brother died
(1:44:11) you're you're you know most people didn't have a brother I'm saying that most Andrew I think you're your son died
(1:44:17) or your friend had sons who died things like it was definitely a hugely traumatic experience yes and for the
(1:44:22) people that it was affecting directly those people have probably had way higher suicide rates than anything today right but my guess is a military veteran
(1:44:29) that deployed into Normandy or whatever or any other theater in World War II probably is higher much higher
(1:44:34) suicidality rates than the average population today so those people were affected negatively sure sure like Audie
(1:44:39) Murphy wrote in his biography that he had nightmares about this and this type of thing so I I agree with you in this aspect however it seems again like if
(1:44:48) we're kind of focusing on this and saying War even takes your mind away from the potentiality of thinking about
(1:44:53) suicidality and this type of thing all roads seem to lead back to materialism being the primary problem here yeah but
(1:45:00) we're not getting rid of materialism so now we need to learn to mentally equip ourselves for him you can actually get
(1:45:05) rid of well you can't get rid of materialism but you can draw back and here's how you can do it religion teaches against materialism now it
(1:45:13) doesn't State emphatically that you can have no material gains but the whole point here is to have some discipline
(1:45:18) against materialism that seems like it's the answer there's no other answer except material or a religion to counter
(1:45:25) materialism what would a secularist say against materialism they have nothing okay
(1:45:32) yeah well I think that's all uh I think that people in this day and age are just spoiled people who don't know
(1:45:37) how to express their selves in their whole position in life I think that we're enjoying all the modern day perks of technology and the accessibility to
(1:45:44) each others and I think that women have always expressed themselves they've always been emotional whatever we can say I think that men have emotions they
(1:45:51) just choose not to express them and I'm not saying expressing them just to Pander to each other but I do think we need to find more solutions as to why
(1:45:57) you feel this way or maybe surround yourself with people who have some sort of discernment to how you feel and can
(1:46:02) help you go through whatever it is you're going through between it's a man in your life or a woman in your life your family um I think that possibly back in the day
(1:46:08) like I said I think that if you're too busy building America you don't really have time to sit here and think about
(1:46:14) how all the people on Instagram are like Filthy Rich and that maybe just your perception but that's not the reality
(1:46:20) and you don't know that if you're not talking to someone about that and I think that a lot of younger people are just on their phone scrolling and
(1:46:26) comparing themselves to people on social media um although they complain about it they enjoy the hell out of it so I guess it's
(1:46:31) a double-edged sword did I lose everybody
(1:46:40) the only thing I would I would push back on is when you said people are spoiled that is kind of Andrew's point right
(1:46:47) that that is like maybe the part about uh people not talking about their feelings as much you may disagree with
(1:46:53) them but I actually agree with this concept like we've lost the ability to feel gratitude because we're constantly
(1:47:00) exposed to things that are outside of our reality like the prettiest girls in the prettiest photos
(1:47:06) that have been face apps and they use facetune and people having Lamborghinis that they don't actually own that make
(1:47:11) us feel incredible amounts of fomo that we were not evolutionarily designed to feel cause us to feel massive amounts of
(1:47:17) depression and another way to say that is we're spoiled because if we were in a scenario where we had to live hand to
(1:47:22) mouth every day we would not have the luxury of even being of worrying about that does that make sense
(1:47:28) yeah but I think that all with all of that it always gears you to want to do better in society so I don't think it
(1:47:33) has to be to the extreme of you feeling like you can achieve those things but you should want to at least you know evolve so so so so there is a balance
(1:47:41) but social media does not provide that balance social media goes way far in one direction to show you incredible levels
(1:47:48) of of um what's it called um wealth and you'll never have
(1:47:55) right and that's why you have a sense of community with your friends your family
(1:48:00) your whoever is next to you you're right you're right yeah you know check yourself and your friends and family
(1:48:05) which is what men don't do you guys just go fishing and just stare at the water I think that's but you know what but hold on
(1:48:12) we go we go fishing and just stare at the water fishing and stare at the water isn't the problem fishing and Sarah at
(1:48:18) the water is probably going to keep you from committing suicide argument promotes gratitude
(1:48:24) gratitude is because like for example if you go fishing you talk about like listen my
(1:48:30) wife hasn't unloaded the dishwasher in three weeks and you're like why don't you want to go fishing let's do it let's do a live
(1:48:37) stream me Andrew Destiny yeah no fishing fishing no listen there is some relaxation to fishing it's true there is
(1:48:44) waiting right now but fishing fishing has nothing to do with fish it has to do with beer drinking and camaraderie I
(1:48:50) know everybody hates this because maybe I don't like fishing but let's say like hypothetically you have some issues in your life and you go fishing you just
(1:48:56) stand there and you're gonna stand in silence that's a little bar is for men that you sit there the issues
(1:49:02) are still there it's like drinking doing drugs having sex did some women do their makeup at two in the morning for nothing
(1:49:08) like fishing and having sex okay okay she chose the worst example
(1:49:16) but I the point that she's making is true and that like it this is what it feels like okay and I think it's been
(1:49:21) true in anything I've seen it maybe for some of you it's not but it feels like if there is a woman and she's about to
(1:49:27) do something dumb or make a bad decision it feels like every single woman in her life is about to give her a whole bunch of reasons why hey don't do this don't
(1:49:33) do that like you seem like you're in trouble like what's going on like let's talk about this and men will literally kind of like sit by and nod and smile
(1:49:39) while their other men like are the most self-destructive in the world it seems like we have a much harder time calling out I don't even
(1:49:46) call out in like a walkway I just know it's not like hey bro you need to like wake the up like you're destroying
(1:49:51) your life right now he's like man I'm more willing to let other men walk off close I'd be like yeah nobody's doing you know good luck yeah I'm sorry
(1:49:57) I didn't mean to cut you off but isn't that part of the nature of men I don't think it's part of the nature of men to
(1:50:03) sh to take risk yeah well I think it does have to be I mean the jobs these very jobs that we're talking about
(1:50:08) working working online things like this uh working as a lineman for the power
(1:50:13) infrastructure you have to take risk we don't risk versus if it's not good for me every single man can learn to have a
(1:50:20) conversation about how they feel even people that work on lines even people that are police officers every single
(1:50:26) guy can learn that it's not that but what does that have to do with what I'm saying even if they can have a conversation about how they feel that doesn't mean that they can necessarily
(1:50:32) mitigate the risk the same way women can because that's part of mitigating the risk the first step is being able to talk to somebody most men don't even
(1:50:38) want to do that yeah but when you're talking about one of the reasons one of the reasons like one of the reasons why
(1:50:43) men live longer in marriage is because they're too stubborn to even go to the  doctor and their wives make them do it they get longer life spans for it
(1:50:50) well actually I think that if a man's woman dies uh he dies shortly
(1:50:55) thereafterwears women live a much longer life yeah because men aren't the best for women all the time
(1:51:00) no that's that's not that's not the case I think that it's it's a heartbreak issue that's what they're they're like
(1:51:06) I'm just saying that men that are men you're talking about risk men have to
(1:51:12) take risks whether they talk about taking the risk or not it's no wonder that when men talk to other men they
(1:51:17) don't mitigate them from taking risk because we know we have to do so because we have to you have to take risk this is
(1:51:23) so stupidly reductive I don't know why you make this so reductive everything it's not about taking risks sometimes guys just get to the core of the
(1:51:30) argument okay it's it's reductive to the point of absurdity like how is it absurd
(1:51:35) it's absurd because when you see a guy making a bad choice or a stupid Choice like bro you need to stop or this
(1:51:40) behavior is not good you need to call it up it's not subjective if your friend is addicted to crack or something
(1:51:47) no guy is like well it's intrinsic in a man's life tires bro those are outliers when you're
(1:51:52) talking about that's exactly we're talking about things like your friends no hold on drug abuses are like one of the big things associated with like
(1:51:58) suicidality and yeah sure but if your friend comes to you on the other hand like with women who say who
(1:52:04) say look um you know I'm unhappy with my relationship and my job they might get
(1:52:09) all kinds of of uh support saying look you don't need to really take much risk stay where the safety zone is whereas if
(1:52:15) men go to their male friends and say look I'm thinking about starting a business okay and I have X amount of
(1:52:21) money saved and that's what I'm gonna do it's right it's highly risky no it's not no I am talking I'm talking it is highly
(1:52:27) risky and their friends are going to encourage them to do that whereas women often will try to retry say you
(1:52:33) shouldn't do that you can look at the trends and see this for yourself women often will gatekeep that and Shake don't
(1:52:39) take risks they're not Risk Takers men are the Risk Takers it's not just with drugs Destiny okay unless you're at 70
(1:52:47) unless you're in okay all risks are not the same game the risk of starting a
(1:52:52) business does not mean that you have to risk dating a girl with BPD who stabbed three men but a woman will go on it stop
(1:53:00) using debate bro terms just listen to what I'm saying instead of being Obsession
(1:53:08) your argument is that the same type of risk that makes a man start a business
(1:53:13) is the same type of risk that makes it make any other number of stupid decisions in his life it's not my argument
(1:53:19) nobody understands your argument I don't know I'm too stupid sorry except everybody who does but I'll repeat it
(1:53:25) anyway no can anyone else on this panel summarize argument mess it up I don't know if anybody else got it I'm sorry I
(1:53:30) bet you Sartain can okay you annoyed his voice to
(1:53:36) even listen to what he's saying nice sorry James so what it sounded to me like what he was saying and you tell
(1:53:42) me what he was actually saying it's not like he was saying you can't tell men that you can't take risks on say crazy women are crazy College decisions
(1:53:48) because men are Risk Takers naturally and if men are are going to encourage each other to do things like starting good businesses they're probably also
(1:53:55) going to watch men take other risks that might equally be bad that the risks good and bad are part of being that's what it
(1:54:01) sounds like you're saying but apparently that's not at all what you're saying so can you explain to me what we're saying please yeah I I don't want to speak for
(1:54:06) him but I think it's a spectrum right like what you said before about people over the age of 30 who are like trying to tear their friends down some people
(1:54:12) are just bad people and some people and like what he said what Andrew said also is the concept of do men need to take
(1:54:17) risks in order to provide more so that they're more attractive to the opposite sex and so that they're useful to men
(1:54:23) yes they have to be able to do both of those things but um yeah I don't want to I don't want to
(1:54:28) put a words what it feels like he sounds like he understood it fine
(1:54:34) nobody understood oh right kind of like but it's kind of it's kind of hyper horrible but what Andrew's saying is a
(1:54:39) little bit hyperbolic it's like like all the time we always have to take risks the reality situation is men can
(1:54:46) Destiny because I'm in the military because I was in the military we had this thing called 22 uh I forgot it was 22 push-ups or whatever and we did 22
(1:54:54) push-ups every day for the 22 men that committed suicide every day in the U.S military it was a serious problem for people in the U.S military and so what
(1:55:00) we did is we tried to enforce a culture where when somebody in our troop was someone in our unit was considering
(1:55:05) committing suicide we would try to get them as much help as possible what we do it like for instance my program my coaching program we turn the recording
(1:55:12) off and we let guys tell them a story it's usually a story having to do with divorce getting cheated on or losing
(1:55:18) custody or losing a lot of money or stuff like that I I think both things can be true men in their nature can be
(1:55:24) more stoic take more risks and be less encouraging of men uh spreading their
(1:55:30) feelings and at the same time that's not necessarily a good thing because I don't want my friends to die like I know
(1:55:35) exactly what you're saying I'm just I think that we can take I think that just because a guy tells me that I shouldn't
(1:55:41) risk smoking crack doesn't mean it's going to destroy my drive to be an entrepreneur right yeah because there's
(1:55:47) different types of risks yes exactly when women go on and they bring a close friend that close friend that literally
(1:55:53) The Stereotype is she's there to validate the woman's choice of man to make sure she's not making some dumb decisions a guy will see another dude go
(1:56:01) with a insanely hot chick who's 19 years old and says she wants you to  breed her tonight and she's got
(1:56:07) a double felony and the guys will be like bro I hope you pull out of time  good luck man like we too did we
(1:56:12) what are you talking about me like this I'm sitting right here it's totally the  office in the world yeah no I know I know you can probably be like a
(1:56:18) good guy friend and tell a guy to mitigate risk if somebody areas without saying you've got to be a neutered puppy that's too scared to take any risk
(1:56:25) whatsoever in life these two things don't have to be the same yeah but what we're saying is that there's a conflation which I think happens
(1:56:30) culturally where because we are the Risk Takers and the pushers of risk that when
(1:56:36) other men do risky Behavior we're less inclined to push back on it's my whole point
(1:56:42) yeah I just I think we're arguing like degrees here like I don't think I think both things can be true I think you can have a a subset of men that is highly
(1:56:50) highly competitive and does not see any weakness whatsoever and then we can have
(1:56:55) a normal reactions with like again my father uh was very stoic and then at
(1:57:00) near the end of my his life we got much closer uh because the walls had to come down for the betterment of our
(1:57:07) relationship both things can be true that's all I'm saying it's like life is a spectrum you know what I'm saying the other thing I would say I would say this
(1:57:12) is when I would deal with like uh The Seer instructors when I was going through serious schools I've gone through uh uh airspace and basic course
(1:57:18) when I was in the military upon training they treated me like they treated me like I was lower than dirt at the end
(1:57:25) they greeted me like I was one of theirs and we were able to share commonality and camaraderie as as uh service members
(1:57:33) and so that that's one thing that happens is that a lot of times men have to earn the respect of other men and then they can they can share in some of
(1:57:39) these commonalities but you know it's um you know it's a very complicated uh
(1:57:44) subject and it's not just one or the other let's let um Alex say something because I think she had her hand raised for a
(1:57:51) while go ahead oh wow I'm still in this debate that's cool that's cool um
(1:57:58) yeah I honestly my brain rotted from listening to that um but no I was gonna bring up a point
(1:58:03) that I don't think anyone's touched on and it's the fact that in today's society porn is so
(1:58:10) normalized and porn rots people's brains and especially with like only fans and fancy and all this
(1:58:17) now all these men are idolizing these women spending all their money on these women that they'll never get to
(1:58:23) be with they're depressed because they'll never be with a woman like this they watch porn all day they jack off all day they do nothing
(1:58:30) with their life and they get themselves into this massive depressive State and
(1:58:35) they're not gonna talk to their friends oh I'm addicted to like porn and I jack off all day and I spend hundreds of dollars every single day on all these
(1:58:42) only fans girls and it makes them depressed and then they just ending up offing themselves right I think
(1:58:49) um don't off themselves but yeah I understand your point yeah but no but
(1:58:55) like I think that's like part of the like drastic increase like in depression in men is is porn and like I
(1:59:02) don't know yeah so I think all of that are coping mechanisms and we need to go down to the root of it which is like the
(1:59:08) CORE family values where the fathers where are the mothers if we're still practicing this ridiculous tradition of
(1:59:14) men not speaking to their sons they're saying well you know I had to figure out how to swim you can figure out how to
(1:59:19) swim in reality they don't have to be in survival mode why are men still in survival mode and why aren't other men
(1:59:25) tapping into this part of them that they are naturally not supposed to it's not like you can't I don't understand why we
(1:59:31) don't look at the the patterns of how that's affected you as a human being as a grown-ass man to look like you know
(1:59:36) what my son doesn't have to be made but he's also not gonna be a cold  so why don't I just like speak some sense into him instead of
(1:59:43) letting the streets raise him or the internet raise him or porn raise him tell us then tell us Angela what is the
(1:59:49) sense that you would speak so that he had the diametric between the two what is the perfect balance do you think
(1:59:54) between him being a stoic man and him being in touch with his feelings and feminine side well you got to think of
(2:00:00) it like in a Workforce like you may feel like you want to punch your boss face but you don't tell her like I want to  stab you you just look early you
(2:00:06) know what not today I'm gonna figure out how to deal with this emotionally get through the day and you have to understand how to compartmentalize your
(2:00:12) feelings it's a time and a place to be stoic there's a time a place to bash someone in the face like I don't know you're just redescribing the problem
(2:00:17) though you're not giving the solution you're saying understanding how to regulate your emotions so if you feel like it's so
(2:00:24) stoicism so how much of that versus how much you're able to engage with these feelings and how you're allowed to be a
(2:00:30) man this is the problem which is fundamental Destiny can't tell you what that is Michael can't tell you what that
(2:00:35) is I can't tell you what that is it's intuitive that's the problem that's because you're asking a question you're saying can you give us
(2:00:41) the exact percentage of stoic feelings a person ought to not even saying that I'm just saying if you were questions that
(2:00:47) you ask on this panel they're literally unanswerable and then you walk away after you've made a point what would Society look like if every man decided
(2:00:53) to press everyone I don't know no one is spurging I'm trying to explain
(2:00:59) something you're asking questions you ask her what is what is the exact level of
(2:01:09) the argument was that the level of unemotional unemotionality or inability
(2:01:14) grapple with her healthily process emotions right now on men is too low that's the argument so tell me so tell
(2:01:19) me where it needs to be then destinations right now it's at 22.8 it needs to be at
(2:01:25) 47.9 Andrew troll it don't give me the answer because you don't know
(2:01:32) Andrew that's exactly the answer I just said it's a noble there's nothing I said
(2:01:37) which was wrong I'm pointing out the critique to her argument no which is very simple it's not the critique no let
(2:01:43) me finish the critique was very simple she said the problem is is that we don't
(2:01:48) know how to match the stoicism between whatever her feminine qualities are for what she thinks that a man ought to use
(2:01:54) in order to process her their emotions what is that supposed to look like I don't know you don't know Michael
(2:02:01) doesn't know it's intuitive it can't be anything but intuitive and you just basically affirm that that's true I did
(2:02:07) not affirm that that's true the problem if you want to use the debate Pro terms
(2:02:12) of what you're doing is you're engaging in a Contin genuine fallacy you're saying that since I can't tell you exactly when the individual bits of sand
(2:02:18) become a pile of sand that piles of sand don't exist if you want an exact answer exact answer if that's an exact answer
(2:02:26) on what it looks like when you engage more healthily with their emotions you could look at the speech that Mr Rogers
(2:02:32) gave in front of Congress where he says maybe some of the drama that we can show young boys on TV aren't two people
(2:02:38) fighting each other to the death like in Power Rangers or GI Joe maybe it could be two boys working out their emotions
(2:02:43) when they're trying to learn how to share toys on the playground or maybe it can be a boy talking to a teacher about
(2:02:48) how upset he is that his mom or dad said something mean to him those would be concrete examples of how to help people
(2:02:54) work through emotions because little girls get that kind of emotional training and little boys don't they're just told to go outside oh it's
(2:02:59) intuitive what I do nothing about what I just said was intuitive it is intuitive the only reason that you're young
(2:03:06) it's really giving you an encounter you know you're giving you a counter argument can you tell me what I just said
(2:03:14) you said one of the ways that you as a as a man or as a woman could give an
(2:03:20) expression for how you can reconcile both of these feelings for both stoicism and the proper amount of aggression
(2:03:26) versus the proper or non-proper amount of aggression he gave these anecdotal examples am I wrong you're wrong they're
(2:03:32) not anecdotals because giving example it's not an
(2:03:38) anecdote you what do you think that means we're anecdotal no they were examples
(2:03:44) for how to deal that's not an anecdote an anecdote is a story that's happened in the past a hypothetical example where
(2:03:50) two stories that happened in the past that's not an anecdote if I say it's describe to this being one no if I say
(2:03:56) hey how can I help how can I discipline a student in the class you go well you could give the student A detention if he misbehaves you go oh well that's an
(2:04:02) anecdote that's not an anecdote do you know what an anecdote is okay backing up try to understand that I did give you
(2:04:08) your argument back if your criticism is that you don't believe that it's anecdotal fine I'll see the criticism I
(2:04:14) don't care but moving into this you say that I'm engaging in a Continuum fallacy but she's the one who gave the argument
(2:04:21) all I did was point out is a criticism to the argument look if you are not able
(2:04:26) to give us this Precision which I don't believe anybody on the panel can then this would have to be intuitive how is
(2:04:33) that wrong because that argument that is a non-sequitur just because you can't precisely
(2:04:39) I was literally just explaining it before you so smugly repeated the question
(2:04:45) I know in between hops of your cigarettes all you can do okay just because you can be right it doesn't
(2:04:50) always be smugging I think you're right the idea right just because I know you think you're right Andrew that's typically how it works thank you yes the
(2:04:57) idea that just because you can't precisely pinpoint how to deal with a problem means that the problem must be intuitively dealt with or it can't be
(2:05:04) dealt with is a non-sequitur that's not true I didn't say only I didn't say only I said in this particular instance yes
(2:05:09) it must be intuitive unless you give me an example of how it couldn't be I just gave you two examples of how you could deal with it you call them anecdotes
(2:05:14) hang on both of those examples don't actually give us anything on the range of spectrum though
(2:05:22) you say that Destiny's intuition says that these are good things to do
(2:05:28) no I mean if you're going to be hyper pedantic we're all speaking from our into pedantic no it is pedantic because
(2:05:34) you're saying my it because Andrew just gave his intuition on what Destiny's intuition was I agree that's true no
(2:05:39) that's reductive and pedantic and pointless all of us we're subjective humans speaking about
(2:05:44) our own personal perspectives they're all right so if you make this argument and I point this out then it's fair for
(2:05:51) me to point that out no it doesn't matter like you're pointing out nothing you're not saying anything actually no I
(2:05:57) am I'm saying something you're actually here let me help you because I can help the irrelevant Factor like I
(2:06:04) can help you understand it Andrew I have a question so so if you think if you think that men are just destined to
(2:06:11) commit suicide and like is a brave thing to do right it's a brave way to go what should men do what
(2:06:17) should change in society for men to commit suicide Less in your opinion I'm sorry what was the last part
(2:06:24) that you asked what's the salute High rates of suicide I think that shingle motherhood is one
(2:06:30) of the number one issues that I would take issue with and I think a lack of masculinity and the understanding of
(2:06:36) society that men are allowed to be men is the number one core issue here so the
(2:06:42) kind of the argument what do you suggest the solution is I just I just gave you the solution we want to remove single
(2:06:48) motherhood motherhood
(2:06:54) motherhood is
(2:06:59) pushing like it it walks out or knocks up a girl and then leaves like that's what yeah and we
(2:07:06) should try to mitigate that suicide yeah we should try to mitigate that and these depressive factors yes that's
(2:07:13) right Malik that's insane it's like you caught on really quickly to what I'm saying so just curious if I put this up suicide
(2:07:20) solved if I look this up is the biggest predictor is the biggest predictor of suicidality being from a single mom why
(2:07:27) would it need to be the biggest predictor is it because you're saying because she asked you what is the thing that you would fix he said that's the
(2:07:32) solution I gave you a multi-pronged answer oh I'm sorry I only heard that problem what was
(2:07:37) the other yeah but you've been having trouble hearing all night so the multi-pronged answer excuse me your intuition as I've been having trouble
(2:07:43) here that's true but I can back this up with evidence that you can't repeat my arguments back well your intuition is
(2:07:49) the can back it up with evidence and I can intuitively
(2:07:55) and you maybe you can intuitively understand them yeah no do you think maybe we can do that my intuition is you're not
(2:08:01) understanding me is it too is it too debate bro-ish for me to point out some of these arguments or am I allowed to
(2:08:07) make them I mean that's I'm sorry
(2:08:14) we would determine what are the goals that we want to achieve so like let's say in this in this instance we want
(2:08:20) specifically for men of this certain cohort to stop uh committing suicide and so what we would do is say okay what are
(2:08:26) the key contributing factors so men over the age of 40 uh uh let's say some sort
(2:08:32) of financial detriment and say loss of child whatever we were to say to look at
(2:08:37) these individuals and say we either need to one try to do things to keep those things from happening like Andrew was
(2:08:43) saying maybe keep the family together do things to try to keep the family together or number two is if we see people in that certain risk group in the
(2:08:50) US military it would happen whenever we'd see enlisted members in very austere locations like Clovis New Mexico or Altus Oklahoma places like that where
(2:08:57) there's just no women those were those tended to be the ones who committed suicide more we would look for those people in those key groups and then we
(2:09:04) would try to figure out a way to come to that person and say hey man do you need help we want to let you know if you need
(2:09:09) to talk we're here to talk to you so Andrew in that case it wouldn't be intuitive we would have a pl we would say this is the the type of individuals
(2:09:16) that might commit suicide and then we'd come up with a plan for those I wouldn't disagree I wouldn't disagree that that
(2:09:23) would not be intuitive at that point but yeah the criticism which I had was we
(2:09:30) need to use this kind kind of like broad generalization and when I ask what does that look like you don't know what that
(2:09:36) looks like so it's just an intuitive assessment at that point it's like that's fair enough I think that
(2:09:41) parenting a lot of parenting is intuition I think that a lot of masculine traits are intuitively
(2:09:47) imparted from man to man I don't think anybody here would disagree with that and so this is the point that I'm making
(2:09:52) against the argument so when I'm looking at this Destiny says I'm engaged in a
(2:09:58) Continuum fallacy we've recognize that that's a response to an argument given to me there's no fallacy it's insane
(2:10:04) based Malik okay so Andrew I just looked up the statistics so the number one reason
(2:10:10) for suicide in men 32 percent of men commit suicide due to work pressures and
(2:10:16) then the second highest reason is financial pressure 31 of men commit suicide over Financial pressures so the
(2:10:23) two highest reasons are work pressures and financial pressure which kind of go hand in hand okay it's not divorce is
(2:10:30) high up there too but it's not about single moms it's not about having a kid somewhere that you don't
(2:10:36) know it's not about actually your staff demonstrate that so your stats no that's what you're giving me for the number one
(2:10:42) reason that is handed for for whatever this problem is that doesn't actually
(2:10:47) show whatever the correlative might be for single motherhood being raised in a single household doesn't show any of
(2:10:52) that one of the only reason they've got to work hard is because they've got to single moms there you go that would also
(2:10:58) be problematic don't you think
(2:11:07) you know what you should do you should do the head on the hands thing next what's that
(2:11:14) answer the question or ask questions if those are the top two causes for suicide
(2:11:20) suicide what is the salute solution to reduce the pressure well the first solution is send me over your data so
(2:11:26) that I can review it so that I know what you're saying to me is actually true you can put it in the private chat and then
(2:11:31) I can review it because the data that I'm looking at show different pressures so there could be conflicting data here
(2:11:37) so that's number one and then the second the second thing is is that again the response to the argument was there's not
(2:11:44) enough masculine versus feminine traits which are passed into to young men and so they don't know how to cope my
(2:11:50) response to this argument was to say well if you don't know what that spectrum is supposed to be and it's intuitive I think men should definitely
(2:11:56) be involved in that process and don't you think that that's one of the primary reasons why children who come from these
(2:12:02) households do far better when they have intact families true
(2:12:10) um okay I know Michael said that he has to go soon so let's give him a chance to uh plug his channel and give any closing
(2:12:17) thought that he has oh hey man I really appreciate it I love the fact that we have open debate on uh
(2:12:23) these channels I appreciate you guys allowing me to come on here and talk um this is a lot of fun uh thank you guys a
(2:12:29) lot um I'm about to start access Vegas on my channel if you guys want to check me out on YouTube at Michael Sartain um
(2:12:35) I also have the Michael Sartain podcast which seems to be very offensive and pissing a lot of people off so if you guys want to check that out that's also
(2:12:40) on my YouTube channel Michael Sartain and um I did a debate it wasn't really a debate uh ended up being too many people
(2:12:46) on the panel with Nick Fuentes not Nick's fault but afterwards his um his followers attacked me and mass reported
(2:12:52) my account uh my Twitter and it's gone so if you guys want to check out my new Twitter it's at uh Sartain podcast you guys are more more than welcome to do
(2:12:59) that I really appreciate it and I will see you guys uh here pretty soon take care hey man thanks thanks again Andrew thank you Angela yeah it was nice
(2:13:05) meeting you I hope we have conversations in the future for sure Hey Stephen I'll talk to you soon brother yeah fun thank
(2:13:11) you guys all right really quickly I want to mention this because yeah uh what Michael said has happened more time than
(2:13:18) it should uh Angela recently had her Discord taken down by a bunch of trolls
(2:13:23) so uh if anyone does the new pwf rule I made a community post about it if anyone he's either talking about dossing
(2:13:29) someone or uh reading their Channel getting them taking down interfering with them in any way you will be banned
(2:13:36) permanent banned from the channel even if it happens on other platforms uh you can talk about people you can say
(2:13:41) whatever you want you can disagree with you this person's a loser they're fat whatever the you want to say but if
(2:13:47) it's uh threats of doxing or threats of like basically getting their channels taken down or de-platforming that's not
(2:13:52) cool so that's just the new pwf policy all right anyway uh do you guys have any more thoughts on this topic
(2:13:58) no I'm good I actually have to get out of here pretty soon too okay let's do
(2:14:04) um I got a little bit of super chats can you guys hang in for a little bit while we go through these of course
(2:14:10) okay uh sorry I said I'm I'm good for like another
(2:14:15) hour before I have to go damn okay cool uh all right let's just quickly go through these
(2:14:21) okay EB Games okay World War II is such a
(2:14:27) cope it was unnecessary okay uh love to see Andrew write Destiny okay
(2:14:34) thank you uh which takes more trading and auto mechanic or mechanical engineer
(2:14:39) it's a nurse or brain surgeon uh do you guys have any thoughts on that um well as the mechanical engineer a
(2:14:46) master I'm sorry is the auto mechanic a Master Auto Mechanic um let's assume he is okay the Master
(2:14:53) Auto Mechanic I think that's the equivalent of I don't remember if it's brain surgery or rocket science but I'm
(2:14:58) pretty sure it's up there with one of the two okay so so hang on so Destiny's dig there was
(2:15:05) a throwback to earlier in the debate he's trying to say that because I claimed that there's a requisite
(2:15:10) training which is required between a journeyman and a master which requires even more than a college education that
(2:15:16) this is somehow a dig on me but what Destiny fails to understand is it actually does he can't dispute that it
(2:15:22) does because it's true in this case I think we probably both agree that a brain surgeon likely has more training
(2:15:27) involved in brain surgery I would assume but I don't know if that's actually I don't know if that's actually true but I
(2:15:33) would assume that it's true I don't think it's true because women can do brain surgery but women can't do construction and men are better than
(2:15:39) women at all jobs that if men can do construction and women can't then women
(2:15:44) can do brain surgery men can't that brain surgery must be easier than construction that'd be mine well then maybe you're a woman because you can't do construction I don't know maybe
(2:15:53) I was a woman who did construction and but I'm not real I'm trying to imagine Malik in the
(2:15:59) construction side all right is it is a party that is ruled by women but all
(2:16:05) manual labor is done only by men in patriarchy or matriarchy uh why all the focus on enforcement interesting
(2:16:11) question uh what do you guys think about that yeah so from my perspective I'm sorry Destiny if you want to go first you can
(2:16:17) oh no I didn't understand the question so go ahead and answer it and then I'll understand it even less gotcha gotcha I I know it's all it's all
(2:16:24) incoherent and debate broish but what he's asking is actually a good fundamental question uh the reason that
(2:16:30) I focus on enforcement is because it's a baseline so we're just looking we're looking at a baseline for egalitarianism
(2:16:35) and the question is asked why can't men and women be equal and we are looking at an enforcement differential and that's
(2:16:41) why I think that they can't be so even then even if women were doing all of the manual labor the enforcement would still
(2:16:48) even if women were the enforcement would still be male so it would still be a patriarchy I just don't think that there's a good way logically around that
(2:16:57) okay uh someone said this all construction police military logging fishing my name blah blah blah blah blah
(2:17:04) is 90 men uh any thoughts on this brave men are better at them well it is
(2:17:10) it is a it is a brave job option of not only bravery which is part of it but the
(2:17:16) fact that they're actually physically structured to be able to do jobs like that which women are not super chest is
(2:17:21) what what I said the current Super Chat is just
(2:17:27) in around 1960s women used to dress like nasty octopus they can be literally killed for taking off the head
(2:17:33) scarf things can go back um okay yeah I mean I think things can go backwards uh okay uh we made
(2:17:41) different delineations for men but now all men just allow women to do something it's crazy how these men that share
(2:17:47) ideology women will solve them making the majority and most likely win um I don't know if that's true but you know
(2:17:53) anyone have any thoughts on this we make different different uh delineations for men now but all men
(2:17:58) just allow women to do something it's crazy how things what
(2:18:04) that's written in a very I'm actually I'm I'm also I'm also confused by the
(2:18:09) Super Chat maybe poorly I think I think we're just like an opinion I think yeah
(2:18:15) it is an opinion I think what he's saying is that a lot of men will just always side with women uh because
(2:18:20) they're soy boys or PC or because they're trying to get late and therefore the female ideology will always win I
(2:18:27) think that's the point uh okay loneliness is an all-time high
(2:18:33) 60 percent of men are single most men don't have close friends men don't feel comfortable expressing vulnerability they comment that you can always get
(2:18:38) that has changed okay that's a statement and then struggle is internal patriarchal standards typically don't allow that freedom absorption things
(2:18:44) hinder men in so many ways which is which is in the is the way in what in
(2:18:51) why patriarchy harms men um yeah I mean I would say that they're okay but I don't think it's a patriarchy
(2:18:59) that's funny man uh causing them to be single and depressed but yeah the thing is saying that like
(2:19:05) men are the reason why men are being harmed um yeah Instagram well yes Mark
(2:19:11) Zuckerberg is a man he invented Facebook hey I think it's technology poor diet lack of exercise lack of purpose I mean
(2:19:19) there's a whole bunch of things you're all presume equality what if men talking about motion doesn't work the same as does a woman in talk therapy there's
(2:19:25) evidence that doesn't work as well on me and could Nails Russian just be different uh yeah it's still therapy
(2:19:31) still works on that it's just yeah I have seen that study it's like a little bit less effective for men than it is
(2:19:36) for women uh but yeah well clearly how they express themselves is different and the way that they even have to
(2:19:42) physically interact with the world is different than women there's significant differences which we just I don't know
(2:19:48) why people pretend that they're not there but they are there and to just we just kind of like turn this Blind Eye to
(2:19:54) it or many at least Progressive seem to turn a blind eye to it but the distinctions are there and there's a
(2:19:59) reason that these all these red pill influencers are going through the roof and it's not because all of them are
(2:20:05) saying things which are correct but it's because they're at least addressing this fact that they hey there's some serious
(2:20:10) distinctions and we should probably acknowledge those I disagree I think there are distinctions but I don't think
(2:20:16) there are serious distinctions and red pillars are absolutely not addressing any of these things I don't like if all
(2:20:22) you needed in Life or if you think that some guy saying like go to the gym and like do Drop Shipping is somehow
(2:20:28) like changing your life like I mean I don't know the idea that red pillars are addressing some fundamental thing in
(2:20:33) society and are providing some huge service I disagree there's a million ways why do you think they're exploding
(2:20:38) in popularity
(2:20:44) because it's a guilty pleasure yeah it's drama it's funny to watch people on women it's funny to watch somebody
(2:20:50) fantasy all of it is drum of course it is a lot of them are not drama I think it's not them being idolized who's
(2:20:57) popular that isn't a drama Channel as far as a uh red pillar goes I would
(2:21:04) say that this largely is not a drama Channel I'm not popular I'm not popular man
(2:21:10) yeah okay okay I'm so I'm talking about manosphere the top people are only in
(2:21:16) drama let me finish I'm talking about manosphere content I think that the reason it's exploded in popularity is
(2:21:22) because it is shining a limelight on some of these issues divorce rates single motherhood things like this which
(2:21:27) people definitely are gravitating towards there's no doubt that that's true just like kind of this is the
(2:21:33) pretend that I'm talking about you just kind of shrug your shoulders and say ah nobody cares they do care they significantly seem to care a lot about
(2:21:40) this issue
(2:21:45) I don't know about that either but there's a reason why fresh and big pearly things are way more popular than
(2:21:50) me what do they do I've been around longer than them what do they do they provide way more drama it's way more entertaining there's a lot of rage board
(2:21:56) I don't generally don't do that nearly as much and therefore uh well yeah I think entertainment's always a factor
(2:22:02) with everything I'm not disputing that but they're still underlying issues here that the Entertainer has to be pushing
(2:22:08) and in this particular case I think that these issues are definitely things that men are gravitating towards they feel
(2:22:13) like they've gotten a bad Shake I can't really say that descriptively a lot of the red pill things are incorrect I
(2:22:19) think a lot of their Solutions are bad I would agree with Destiny on that but descriptively I think they nail a lot of
(2:22:24) things out of the park and that's why they soar in popularity yeah I mean depends on which thing we're
(2:22:30) talking about I think they're dead wrong about some of the things uh they literally treat a relationship like a
(2:22:35) transactional encounter or some like dude is going to break into the house every week and you have to like fight them off and that's like the main value
(2:22:41) proposition the girl contributes sex and women don't even like sex I'm curious would you would you say that um all of
(2:22:48) the crazy like feminist was also like all very true and that's why it got so popular so all the crazy Nicki Minaj
(2:22:55) songs or all the crazy call me daddy podcast whatever these red pillars hate were those all factual and true and that's why they got so popular no but
(2:23:02) there's a distinction here one was pushed literally media pushed the media pushed all feminist talking points we
(2:23:09) can go over an entire overview of how they did so in this particular case this is these are counter claims to a lot of
(2:23:15) those media push talking points and I think that largely the whole red pill thing started underground as you it
(2:23:23) definitely was not pushed by Major it was still literally incredibly put by Tick Tock that's recent and that's
(2:23:30) recent and that's what happened in the system when the system fought back against Tate they've arrested his ass
(2:23:37) they threw him in prison and they're probably he's probably going to spend the rest of his life in prison so the thing is is like look you can say this
(2:23:43) all you want but there's distinctions between the two feminism has been pushed broadly for about a hundred years uh it
(2:23:51) started as kind of low-key before it really kicked off in the 60s moving into the 70s this type of thing it has a cult
(2:23:57) Roots going all the way back to even the late 1700s there's a great book written on this it's called occult feminism by
(2:24:03) Rachel Wilson you should read it you're recommending me books by your wife thank you why why shouldn't I why would I read
(2:24:10) what she has to say she's a woman you don't believe that women should even like be educated Oh you mean all you mean the thing that earlier in the
(2:24:16) debate you asked if I believed it and I said I did and we already clarified so now you're lying so now you're lying
(2:24:22) again well no actually how many times are you gonna lie well that was just my intuition that you feel that way well your intuition was wrong your intuition
(2:24:29) isn't my intuition is wrong we don't know that right well no I do have specific ways that I can make this knowledge claim that
(2:24:34) you're into it well you're intuitively earlier no it's not it's smart claim
(2:24:42) both things that I contradicted myself on so the contradiction the the first thing was you said Andrew do you believe that
(2:24:48) women should be allowed to pursue higher education I said yes now you've brought it up a second time as though I didn't
(2:24:54) when you know that I did that's not true initially I declare that it is true then my intuition believes the same things
(2:25:05) all right um can you address how office intuition is
(2:25:10) right now Andrew or I'm sorry Alex I'm a moderator I don't want to get involved in the debate uh shout out to
(2:25:17) Michael 13 day out giving his personal time to help men improve her social life okay uh yeah
(2:25:23) Michael you have a fan appreciate the Super Chat uh yeah but anyway uh those
(2:25:28) are all the super chats I mean like me personally when it comes to this debate I kind of sometimes agreed a little bit
(2:25:35) more with uh Destiny sometimes we'll read more with Angela uh on certain
(2:25:40) things I sort of agreed with uh Andrew so I'm kind of like in the middle between you guys uh okay we have uh
(2:25:51) you're like you're totally different when it comes to the base than what comes to speed Gates you're like uh hardcore like right
(2:25:57) winging Trump saluting like Malik jeez
(2:26:03) uh I heard on Trump's loot but
(2:26:09) we got okay so Katie wanted to come on and I think uh to be angel on a few
(2:26:14) things you guys mind if I let her own I have to actually get rolling um so I'll just do an outro if you want
(2:26:21) me to yeah go ahead okay so my name is Andrew Wilson I'm the host of The Crucible thank everybody on the panel
(2:26:27) for the spirited conversation I don't hold any grudges for conversations like this you never have uh and appreciate
(2:26:32) all of your guys's time you can find me uh there on YouTube and with that I'll get out of here have a great night all
(2:26:38) right take it easy buddy good meeting Andrew also my wife's book is great destiny
(2:26:47) all right uh Andrew's wife has a good book that's the takeaway all right let's bring on Katie uh yeah so you want to
(2:26:53) talk about something with who Angela Malik with you
(2:26:59) um hey Katie [Music] can we also thank God that Andrew left
(2:27:06) like let's be honest okay now no I actually I actually loved Andrew
(2:27:13) like at the start of this debate and like the more he talked like the more he pissed me off great guy though I thought
(2:27:19) he was amazing content yeah I'm I'm glad he's not here because he would have completely derailed what I
(2:27:26) want to talk to you about so here's the thing right and I I so quick question so I'll know
(2:27:32) where you stand on this you said that you think guys it's like their own fault
(2:27:37) that they're that suicidal or whatever that they have uh Rising suicide rights
(2:27:42) right um but then in the first section you talked about gender roles and how gender
(2:27:48) roles are important now whether gender roles are because of biology or nurture
(2:27:54) the only way we can affect how people are is through socialization do you
(2:28:00) agree with that because we can't change people biology yeah of course okay good so I think that you can't both support
(2:28:08) gender roles that make men is life shitty and bad and make them suicidal
(2:28:14) and then blame men that it's their fault that they're toxic and suicidal you know you it doesn't work both ways you you
(2:28:21) need to pick a sign yeah but I never said that I never said I said that I think gender roles I said that gender
(2:28:27) roles are extremely important for society ID biologically genetically men are better at doing certain things and
(2:28:33) women are better at doing certain things and I think to dismiss that is absolutely stupid and and will just
(2:28:39) inconvenience and make everything worse for everyone and it's men's fault that men are depressed and not okay because
(2:28:46) in most Societies in most households when you have a little boy his father all his friends all his peers
(2:28:53) are telling him men don't cry men go to the gym men work out if you're sad like hit the gym like work out men don't cry
(2:29:00) it's gay to cry it's gay to talk about your emotions it's gay to be depressed soy boy soy boy go kill yourself that's
(2:29:06) what men say to other men
(2:29:13) like I've never in my family with older men it's not so much but with younger
(2:29:18) men like Destiny's day before like under the age of 25 that's extremely
(2:29:24) prevalented Alex I waited so long wait sorry to say
(2:29:30) this I think maybe online that could be true in certain communities but I think in like real life like no I'm talking
(2:29:35) about in real life I have seven brothers I just okay maybe we just have a chance I'm surrounded by men in my personal
(2:29:41) life and I see this all the time one younger men are not the issue older
(2:29:47) men are the ones who are killing themselves and droves so whatever you want to talk about younger men sure it's an issue it's nothing
(2:29:54) okay but the reason why older men are killing themselves is because their whole life they're raised with
(2:30:00) this mentality that they are alone they have no one to fall back on they have no emotional support system they're a man
(2:30:06) they need to toughen up they try to their whole egg right they've made it to 40 50 years ago and it didn't
(2:30:12) work out so they kill themselves I agree with you so here's the thing because maybe I'm misunderstanding you when you
(2:30:18) say gender roles do you just mean the fact that men work at certain jobs because that's not what gender roles are
(2:30:25) the reason why men and okay so when you when we talk about gender roles there
(2:30:31) are many reasons biological and socialization wise why men end up in
(2:30:36) certain jobs or do certain roles like leading or protecting or whatever the
(2:30:42) you want to call it and the reason why the gut socialization comes hand in
(2:30:48) hand with the toxic stuff that you don't like that makes them want to kill themselves when you base an entire
(2:30:54) higher man's value on their ability to lead and protect and then they fail at
(2:31:00) their Duty they off themselves or more likely to have themselves because now they have no value but that that is the
(2:31:07) price of the gender roles that you're supporting I literally stated multiple times a lot of the issue for men's
(2:31:14) depression is their ego because they base their value on fitting into
(2:31:20) societal standards and societal norms and I think that's extremely toxic and men should not do that okay so we should
(2:31:27) have Alex okay Destiny you want to really quickly
(2:31:32) plug yourself yeah real quick Instagram uh YouTube kick Destiny love you guys be careful bye
