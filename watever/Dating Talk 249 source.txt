(19:24) question

 You've had sex with people Have you ever had sex with

(19:55) somebody more than once

 yes of course Have you had sex three times of course

(20:00) So I thought it was about relationships Now it's about sex You

 Well it can be any

 Yeah Now you confusing me because at

(20:07) first it was about relationship

 The title Spicy was originally about her but I think there could be some other

(20:13) neurodeivergent people at the table

 So you got us

 You found us

 We all

 I mean

(20:20) I'm also a little autistic so

 thank you Thank you Um

(20:26) usually when you're in it like you can tell

 So okay Yeah true

 You meet a guy I'm not saying you're in a relationship

(20:32) Are we talking about a relationship or here i have a book Uh Dr Seuss

 Oh my god

(20:37) In order to be on the book

 I need you to read three pages of Green Eggs and Ham

 I

(20:43) like that book I love that book

 I like fish

(20:48) So are we talking about Are we talking about relationship

 okay Can you read the first Look it's just a literacy test

 I

(20:54) do not like green eggs

 Literacy test Can you read the first three pages

 you can

(21:00) keep that

 of the book

 She's not going to do it Okay Well I think we're going to

(21:05) have to fail you on the whatever literacy test

 I can read it

 You No it's okay

 She is

 Since you good at educating

(21:11) educate me

 You go on

 words

 What are you talking about what are we talking about we talking about a book we talking about

(21:17) sex

 she said that with her chest You hear she said that with her chest Okay So look Um

 I'll explain it again this

(21:26) girl

 Madam Houston should I write notes find me everywhere

 Take notes

(21:32) What's the period of time the longest period of time you have seen a guy and

(21:38) I'm not talking relationship Maybe it was a casual thing Was it you saw one guy for 3 months i know you wouldn't

(21:45) [ __ ] Is she She's like looking back here Okay

 Sorry Does that make sense

 yeah it makes sense

(21:51) And I thought I answered it

 You No no no You said "Oh but I haven't been in a relationship."

 Is that you sound like

(21:58) Kermit

 yeah that's exactly how you sound like that

 Kermit the Frog

 I'm looking for a number 3 months 6 months

(22:06) I don't keep up with the time I just see people and they go about their business I go about mine

 She's a free spirit

(22:12) Literally

 one day I'm trying to be

 uh you uh

 so

(22:22) my turn already I'm shaking

(22:29) You You just don't know

 Not that I don't know I'm just saying like I've never really been in a relationship where

(22:36) somebody's asked me to be their girlfriend But I don't really move like that So I move open-mindedness So I'm

(22:43) wellrounded

 Do any of the girls want to point out her failure in understanding what I'm asking

 you know maybe it's just

(22:50) I need a female touch here I'm going to let one of the women explain it to her because I'm I'm not getting through to her

 Scientist

 I have So let's

 We might

(22:59) need scientist Wait wait Yeah we do need the PhD here because I think you know

(23:04) she's the most educated woman here at the table Let's get the PhD to explain What I think the host is trying to

(23:09) express is that yes there is a difference between being in a relationship and having sex I think we

() 

(23:15) all agree on that at this table Correct Right Okay So he is not um he is not

(23:22) expressing that those two things are simultaneous However you have expressed that you have never been in a

(23:28) relationship We understand that However he is asking what was the time period

(23:34) between when you had sex and how long you haven't had sex because he assumes

(23:39) that you as a single lady right now are not having sex You are not with somebody

(23:45) Oh god damn You're [ __ ] this [ __ ] up I feel like you're making that [ __ ] way too that statement That was really

 Have

(23:51) you had a situationship or a [ __ ] buddy or friends with benefits what is the length of the longest length of time

(23:57) that that has lasted it doesn't matter Literally like we all have sex and we

(24:03) don't keep up with the actual time I'm not paying attention to the time I started [ __ ] with somebody versus the

(24:08) time

 I don't I I'm looking for a ballpark You don't need to tell me Well it was 73 days and 23 hours

 You since

(24:16) you know everything you take your guess and then you write about it

 Is there one guy you boked longer than anybody else

(24:22) like how many minutes or

 like what no not minutes I mean like

 No no like like amount of time Like I've been banging

(24:28) this guy for six years I've been banging this guy for 10 years I've been Is there one guy in particular

 yes Is there a guy

(24:34) you banged for a year i mean no

 Okay

 Okay

 There we go

 Moving

(24:42) on

 Yeah please I'm ready

 Well

(24:47) um

 soon Soon Chad Soon Okay Um All right So you've been single never

(24:54) had a boyfriend How many guys are currently in the picture as many as I want to be As many as as

(25:01) many as I want to have

 Open your ears A little uh listening comprehension would

(25:06) do you well Are there I get that you're open I get that you're open

 to other men

 okay

(25:14) getting involved The question is are there currently men in the picture

(25:22) there's currently openings for men in the picture

 That literally doesn't answer the question I think you're

(25:27) hooked

 I take that as a

 She's obviously trolling at this point

 There's openings in that That means it's a no right or

(25:35) yes

 Whatever you take it Y'all listening right what are you here for

(25:40) i feel like there's a there's another option It's not that she doesn't understand or she does Have you ever heard of a word hustler sometimes when

(25:47) you don't want to tell somebody something you dance around it by answering in other ways What you're looking for is a direct answer What

(25:53) she's giving you is the answer she wants to

 Can you speak

 exactly I'm giving you the answer I want to So take it or leave

(25:59) it

 You know at the end of the day the day is going to end kind of thing

 If that makes sense

 There's always tomorrow

(26:05) Yep There always is

 Tomorrow is today Today is yesterday

 So you're Are you a virgin Good for you

 I mean like do you think

 If you

(28:51) use a tampon

 it's not a penis

 It doesn't break your

 I don't know what kind of tampons they got in Cuba

 I don't I don't

(28:58) believe it

 Some Some physically some tampons can break the

(29:04) highman depending on anatomy of the body But a broken highman would not

 I don't believe that a broken

 No but some

(29:10) religions do see a broken

 Okay we don't got to go that deep on it but yeah

 that

(29:16) you're

 it's your personal belief if you believe that or not It's okay So I didn't lose my virginity on a high

(29:21) school cuz nobody was like hot and like nobody was hot

 Yeah literally I was in like art school and there was like two

(29:27) hot guys and they were kind of like doing each other maybe I don't know But also my friends like them so I couldn't

(29:33) really like I don't know they were older than me too so I have no chance And then

(29:38) uh I did make up with girls and guys at parties and stuff like that So yeah Yeah

(29:46) Okay All right

 Contestant number

 and like my first boyfriend He was my best friend He

(29:52) said he liked me and after like a while I decided to date him

(29:57) That's the story

(30:26) want to respond to Metro Matt metro Matte Trump tan I've kind of thought I was a little bit more golden I've never

(30:32) been told I was orange I like to think that I'm golden Okay

(30:39) Word One sec guys I'm going to get the TTS figured out I have no idea why I wasn't working That's weird Uh huh

(30:47) Strange Well relationship status

 All right Um do you remember last time I was on I told you I was in a relationship

(30:54) with someone who was polyamorous previously uh I mean

 and you were like

(30:59) that's not going to last You're an idiot Was I right

 oh you were 100% right

 Nice

(31:04) Um yeah So that ended um last year and I have started seeing someone It's very

(31:09) new So fingers crossed

 So you're in a relationship currently

 yes And uh

 how soon how soon after your last appearance

(31:16) and I told you it wasn't going to work with polyamorous guy

 Did you guys break up

(31:22) um it was about a month after Yeah

 Yeah We'll see

 Yeah

(31:30) [ __ ] prediction Predicted that [ __ ] Okay

 Mhm

 Uh how long

(31:35) have you been seeing this new guy

 um couple of uh months now Yeah it's new Three months

 Uh about five Yes

 five

(31:43) months Longest relationship

 my longest relationship was um the previous one which was four years

(31:53) All right Who broke up with who in the four-year relationship

 um I ended it because I

(31:58) found um evidence if you know what I mean of he was doing the Polly stuff again

 So

(32:06) what is Polly stuff

 the thing you said that you do

(32:12) You said you were Polly

 You signed up to be in a relationship with a poly person Yeah Well he said he wasn't poly anymore

(32:18) and he wanted to be monogamous That's like trying that's like trying to date like a gay guy and him being like

(32:26) but

 I mean unless he was never really poly He just wanted to keep his options open

 He said that he was married

(32:32) previously and that was a monogous relationship and he wanted to go back to that type of relationship and I was like

(32:38) okay if you want to do that again I'm your girl H

 well you have to ask him why he divorced her cuz he probably was

(32:44) being Polly on their relationship I don't feel like you can just like go back and forth on like your sexuality

(32:50) either

 right like once a player always a player

 I'm not a fan of Polly I'm just not what they want that's what they're

(32:56) going to do

 That's what I'm saying Like if a guy is gay

 I don't know how you ever trust them

 I want to date you and be in a relationship with a woman like

(33:04) they don't like men anymore just by saying it

 Uh what about you

 oh um about

(33:09) me So I've been single a while now Um my longest relationship

(33:14) was probably around 7 years Uh I broke up with him I still have the wedding

(33:20) ring I've only ever had long-term relationships but I eventually get bored and I leave which is kind of shitty but

(33:26) I'm an honest person Um there's things that I want in this world that maybe they don't want the same things as me So

(33:33) once they get too comfortable I have to go I have an avoidant attachment style I think How long have you been single

 um

(33:40) it's been like three years now I think Three years Yeah

(33:45) Longest relationship

 Um I think was the seven-year one Yeah

(33:50) Seven year Who broke up with who

 i broke up with him and I kept the ring

 Oh you

(33:56) guys were engaged

 Yeah girl I did the same thing

 Is it engagement if uh he asks me to marry him and I keep the ring

(34:03) and I don't say yes No The answer is no I think legally you

(34:08) have to return the ring

 Okay So I was if I tried to return it he would probably start crying and beg me to come back and

(34:14) buy me a bigger ring I don't plan on doing that

 You can ship it to him I guess

 But I was engaged and there's different laws in every state So like I

(34:21) was I I was living in Colorado He's from Ohio We got engaged in New Jersey and we

(34:27) lived in Florida And every I had I looked into it because I was like it depends on who breaks up with who and

(34:33) every state's different though

 um

 and how it goes down

 Yeah I I don't know I guess there are different laws based on

(34:40) the state but my understanding was is generally the ring has to be returned

(34:45) has to if they choose to take it back but I I would never keep something if if

(34:50) they wanted it back Yes I suppose they could keep something like that um something that expensive uh knowing that

(34:57) I wasn't looking to pursue it But whenever I told him that I I was done with him uh he was like "No you just

(35:04) keep it."

 And he started crying and I was like "Okay thank you." And I feel bad I do feel bad but he was

(35:10) a jerk I mean

 what a jerk

 He was a real jerk Yeah that guy

 All right Uh what

(35:17) about you

 so I've been with my boyfriend Chris for almost 2 years We'll be celebrating our 2-year anniversary in

(37:12) everything Oh a bar

(37:18) playing I'm

 kidding

 Nice Awesome

 What about you i am single and I've actually

(37:24) never had a relationship before Um longest situationship probably like

(37:29) three months and I've had maybe three more serious situationships

(37:34) All right Women Sorry

 U men I'm straight Yes

(37:41) Uh and you said you're a virgin Is that correct i am And you're you're a Christian right

 yeah So I'm waiting till marriage

 So you're waiting until marriage Okay

 Are you waiting until

(37:48) marriage

 no

 No

 She lost her virginity She uses tampons

 Wait do you use tampons

(37:54) cuz you might not be a virgin anymore Apparently not though

 Not Canadian ones So

 virginity is just a concept Literally

(38:01) Yeah And concept at this point at this point because you can you can put something

(38:08) you can give somebody uh connolingus or fellatio You're not a virgin In my

(38:14) opinion you're not

 cuz you're doing something sexual It's you know virgins always try to find a loophole to uh

(38:21) avoid guilt But

 I used to have a friend She would say that she would do it back

(38:26) door Yeah She would say she would do it in the back door She's like "I'm still a virgin cuz only in the back." I'm like

() 

(38:32) "Girl

 but okay So you say that virginity is a social construct."

 I think so

 Well

(38:37) it it depends how you're framing it So you would agree though that there would be an objective basis Like for example

(38:43) if someone has not had sexual intercourse they would That's objective

(38:50) You've never been penetrated if you have never had sexual intercourse But if you've put a dick in your mouth or in

(38:56) your booty hole that doesn't make you a virgin

 Well that you're still doing something sexual

 right

 sure I mean I

(39:04) guess you would have to say okay well what constitutes virginity then

 Yeah So then

 I would agree with you if a woman

(39:11) engaged in anal sex like she had penetrative anal sex performed on her but she hasn't had vaginal intercourse I

(39:20) would she would not at least in my view be considered a virgin

 but if she engaged in oral sex that's where things

(39:27) get a little hazy I'm not sure if I'd grant if I would remove the virgin

(39:33) categorization from a woman if she engaged in oral sex with somebody

 Yeah Then

 perhaps she lost her oral sex

(39:40) virginity or something

 What if she swallowed is she you put somebody's

(39:46) semen in your throat and you

 Yeah I think it's still not like pure but it's not

 l like you're you still you're still

(39:53) a virgin if you haven't

 What is a virgin to you if that if I could ask you that What is a virgin to you

 i feel like a

(39:59) person that has never had sex with a man like a girl I would agree that there's well the

(40:06) I don't know if wi whatever the way women can have sex is if they have that

(40:12) then I guess you wouldn't be a virgin Go ahead though

 I would agree that it's not just like vaginal penis and vagina Um I

(40:20) do think like the back door you're probably not a virgin anymore

 Um I still under those definitions would be

(40:27) considered a virgin Even oral sex too have not partaken in that

 No felio

 Yes

(40:33) No fellatio So no matter your definition and those terms I still would be categorized as a virgin

 So are you

(40:40) planning to wait till marriage you mentioned the word pure earlier and I I found that kind of interesting Is there

(40:46) um is there an ultimate goal behind your virginity and are you looking for a virgin partner or just a partner to lose

(40:54) yours to i don't know So I plan on waiting till marriage because I believe that God made sex in the covenant of

(41:01) marriage one man and one woman Um I wouldn't necessarily not marry someone because they weren't a virgin either cuz

(41:07) I do think there's grace and forgiveness Um it would just depend on their heart posture towards it I would say Um what

(41:14) was your other question

 uh just that your goal would be towards having a a virgin husband or your goal in virginity

(41:20) is to save it Yeah

 Yeah I would say with why I bring up purity is because it's not like oh

(41:27) you're about a restriction of you shouldn't have sex It's not like that's not the lens in which I view it It's how

(41:33) can I glorify God with my body

 and so using sex in the the covenant of

(41:38) marriage And so when you talk about too like oral sex technically maybe some

() 

(41:44) people would say that's not

 having sex but it's still impure And so then as a

(41:49) Christian I should say is this really honoring God with my body and honoring my future potential husband too

 Now if

(41:56) you were to get married to somebody and you found out that he was impotent and incapable of having children or you

(42:01) found that out before marriage would you still marry him

 if the virtues that you hold for yourself um he couldn't keep

(42:07) those for your marriage

 So if he couldn't have children and I'm already married would I stay married to him

 mhm Yes

 Because I do believe marriage is a

(42:15) lifelong partnership or you know it's two becoming one Um now obviously that'd be devastating Like I do want to have

(42:22) children but I don't think it's something that I would I mean I know I wouldn't divorce him because of that I

(42:27) don't really believe in divorce So

 Oh okay

 In most cases I think there's like maybe two exceptions

 right oh no I get

(42:32) what you mean there

 Yeah

 What are the exceptions

 probably And so I know Catholics would say I'm reformed

(42:38) Protestant Um Catholics would say there's really no exception I think cheating or like if you're being

(42:44) physically abused then I think there's maybe some room for that I could be persuaded either way on that one but I

(42:51) do think overall like in most

 persuaded either way Persuaded that um maybe there

(42:59) should be no divorce period Like take out the exceptions

 Oh I thought you meant on the topic of abuse

 Oh no

 you

(43:06) panicked me for a moment

 Just abuse them back

 No I'm sorry Like just abuse them

(43:12) back and then it'll be okay You make it even Even Steven So going back to the virgin thing I don't really consider

(43:18) myself like a virgin because I feel like I haven't had sex but like I do other stuff

 You masturbate

 yeah Yeah Like you

(43:25) know but you know what I mean so at that point I don't really think

 Yeah I guess it depends on your definition of these

(43:30) things right So I mean I guess I would consider it to be probably anything where there's like

(43:36) penetration but I like do it myself So like Yeah I guess I don't know

 Yeah What if you stick your fingers in yourself is

(43:43) that that counts as penetration as well but like if someone else

 technically

 I would say

 I think like also like cuz I

(43:50) was born and raised Catholic

 I think it back to your point of like it's like you are honoring God with your body and like

(43:57) the sacredness of marriage I think it's like your intentions behind the actions

(44:03) also count too like and saving that like more of like your pure like keeping your

(44:08) mind pure of those like temptations so that you can save that for when you have

(44:14) your lifelong partner your husband pretty much but it's it's definitely interesting

 Yeah And I of course don't

(44:21) say that out of a place of judgment but I believe like this is the design that I think God made for everyone is to have

(44:29) this special bond Like the the reason that you know whenever you have sex oxytocin I think is the drug that bonds

(44:36) you That's really hard whenever you're doing one night stands

 We also get

(44:41) oxytocin from hugs So by hugging somebody and receiving that oxytocin you're getting the same benefit that you

(44:48) would from sexual activity I think you get more oxytocin with a penis than a hug

 I guess I can't speak to that since

(44:54) I don't really know I've never experienced it But I do think that

 the fact that that happens speaks to a

(45:01) certain purpose of it Like it's supposed to bond you to that person

 Madam H I

(45:06) think we need to hear from you on this topic I think I agree with your opinion but in

(45:15) my opinion I think that you know masturbation you know anything that has to do with

(45:21) sexual you know anything that you're doing sexual whether it be with yourself or with anybody else it's natural So it

(45:28) shouldn't be looked at as unnatural even in the eyes of religion just because that's what God put us on earth to do We

(45:36) are here to procreate and survive So if we are procreating that's natural in the

(45:42) eyes of God If you go back like obviously in time and like why there's even religion and I think like religion

(45:52) obviously has like deep roots and every culture has like different religions um based on where they are on the world in

(45:58) the world But I feel like a lot of it was like religion and those rules and

(46:03) everything on the ten commandments and everything like that was created to kind of help structure society So when you go

(46:09) back to times where there wasn't Trojan condoms on the readily available and you

(46:14) know to control like diseases and certain things like that it was probably easier for people to like to impose no

(46:23) offense but you get like the Catholic guilt like you know you have that you feel guilty about that and although it's

(46:28) natural I think just going back to like how society and civilization like

(46:33) progressed I think that that definitely helped create some structure for like

(46:38) for just maintaining people and just helping diseases not spread I don't know That's just kind of my thoughts on that

(46:44) Yeah I guess on those questions I would just ask like why do you think that because if you do believe that God made

(46:51) us to procreate like why do you believe that

 no that's natural What's in the Bible you know or

 So do you believe the

(46:58) Bible is true

 as humans we are here to procreate Like having sex is a natural

(47:03) thing It shouldn't be I feel like people put so much pressure on sex which is why

(47:08) you know people that think like you they think that oh my body is a temple Your

(47:14) body can still be a temple if you do have sex It's about the respect that you show for yourself when you when you are

(47:20) using it And it's not about you know you saving yourself for the right person cuz you could save yourself for uh somebody

(47:27) that has deceived you Now what

 that would be unfortunate

 Exactly So saving

(47:32) yourself is it for you or is it for somebody else

 i think it's for the your

(47:38) marriage and I think it's to honor God And so I guess on that like I totally agree it's natural to have sex It's we

(47:44) are called to be fruitful and multiply It's just in what context is it made to be in and I would argue from the Bible

(47:51) it's marriage And that's pretty clear in the Bible So to if you believe the Bible is true then you have to agree with

(47:58) those things Not just that it's you know it it's true whenever it's convenient but like what does it actually say about

(48:05) these things

 mhm

 Does that make sense

 it makes sense

 Wait so you're you're a virgin

 But you said uh you're not

(48:13) waiting until marriage though

 No I don't really consider myself a virgin I just said that

(48:19) You don't consider yourself

 Yeah I don't really talk about it like "Oh I'm a virgin."

 But you said you've never been with a guy right

 yeah I mean

 but are you

(48:24) So what are you waiting for the right guy are you

 yeah I guess I just feel like

 So if you did meet the right guy

(48:31) you would have sex right away

 No really cuz I feel like you could think "Oh this

(48:36) guy is right." Like I don't know how to explain it Like listening to their conversation I feel like after I get my period I'm like "Okay I wish I had a boyfriend or like I'm like looking for a

(48:43) partner or something." A week later it's gone I don't give a [ __ ] you know but like that's just like you know

 so while

(48:48) you're ovulating

 yeah Obviously

 you wait So you you're like ready to go

 when

(48:55) you're ovulating

 like mentally like I don't want it Like men are not it like Okay Oh my bad My bad

 Um I just feel

(49:02) like there's nobody good there out there There's no there's nobody

 I mean yeah I

(49:09) just haven't met them you know and I feel like if I met somebody I wouldn't like do it right away Like I want to meet them like get to know them wait a

(49:15) few months cuz they probably haven't like sleeping with other people anyways right so

 I feel like what is so like

(49:21) special about sleeping with whoever whenever

 there's nothing special about it It's natural

 So I just do whatever I

(49:28) want Usually you don't encounter OAF girls

(49:34) who uh are also virgins Like the virgin to OF

(49:40) pipeline is usually not there There are outliers

 everyone I

(49:47) think that's a big thing too though like every you get started with OAF and you get put in a box and I think that it's

(49:54) for the m like I guess that what I'm saying is like that for the majority like there are like I guess generalistic

(50:02) things that you can think about those girls like most of the time but there are outliers

 Yeah I I agree it's

(50:08) logically possible

 generalistic things logically possible that is why say that I'm a virgin So it

(50:15) is logically possible that a girl could be a virgin and do Only Fans It just seems really unlikely What seems more

(50:21) likely to me is that there is a subset of men perhaps a large amount of men

(50:27) that view virginity that characteristic as something desirable and attractive in

(50:32) a woman So it would behoove an Only Fans girl to lie about this and claim to be a

(50:37) virgin when she's not because this is going to mean that she's going to cater to a certain clientele that finds this

(50:44) attractive These men are going to be more inclined to spend money on her Maybe she can fleece more money from

(50:51) them So it does seem a bit dubious

(50:57) Again usually women who are virgins are not just jumping the gun to being

 also

(51:02) digital prostitutes

 right well I mean by that standard then you could also say that someone who says they're virgin but

(51:09) is religious could also be using it for gain

 I think I both could be true

 Yes it is It is

(51:17) true that

 a Christian woman who's not a virgin could lie about being a virgin

(51:24) We've all lied I mean we've actually we've actually had some Christian women on the show claim well claim to be

(51:30) Christian and claim to be virgins and

(51:36) you know I'm not I I would never like you know say anything about somebody who's previously been been on the show

(51:42) but I'll get messages from individuals both men and women saying "I know this person intimately Uh I know this person

(51:50) and they're not a virgin like they've had sex." I ain't never met a man who has had sex with a woman and gotten a

(51:55) receipt back So it really doesn't matter Receipt Receipt A receipt Like how can

(52:00) you physically prove you had sex with somebody

 i suppose what if I suppose it's also logically

(52:07) possible that somebody could be contacting me and lying about it But it is the case that I have received

(52:15) people messaging me saying "Hey that girl who was on on your show who claimed to be a virgin she's not a virgin I was

(52:20) [ __ ] her last weekend." Okay nobody's going to say that about me But also I don't really say that I'm a virgin Like

(52:26) this is the first time I really talk about it other than like when people are like "Oh can I get this video?" And I'm like "No you can't." Like "Sorry." You

(58:49) car with him went to the island and then we had we had fun that night And then

(58:54) literally like the next morning he just fell fell to the ground and he started

(58:59) seizing and I was like "What in the world is going on?" I thought he was joking with me So it was spit coming out

(59:04) of his mouth I had to turn him on his side and I was like "We on the island too I don't know the address of the

(59:10) place I don't know where we at I don't know who to call but I know

 can't call

(59:16) me on the island."

 I didn't know who to call So but I know how to um treat

(59:22) somebody during a seizure cuz they taught us that growing up in school So I just turned him on his side waited till

(59:28) um waited till he was done season He had a gash on his back so you know I patched it up and I was like I'm ready to go

(59:33) home Rocking Oh you have another one

 I feel like you literally brought the

 Huh

(59:39) nothing Whatever

 Wait what

 nothing

 She saw the question that came up on the screen and wants to talk about it

(59:46) Wait what

 um someone sent in a question that said um well it wasn't even a question It was like the girl in the red

(59:51) dress is lying

 Oh

 She wants to talk about it

 Wait why

 nothing I just said

(59:58) that he was typing and then it came up So like

(1:00:20) put my hands up in the air So she thinks I'm sending them in I get accused of this all the time Oh nobody's actually

(1:00:32) I'm going to have to click it though to let it come through Or I could click it on my uh iPad there Okay I got to keep

(1:00:38) my hands up

 Oh hang on She thinks that he's actually the one

 Honestly I was just joking It's not that serious But why

 now what

 nothing Whatever

 Just say

(1:00:46) it Go ahead

 Like why are you getting so defensive it feels like it's for real And also she's typing yourself

 She's

(1:00:52) typing So if we wanted to go but it was it was just a joke It was

(1:00:57) just a joke guys

 Mary should send one in I was joking It's not that serious Wait

(1:01:03) there's something I wrote down a good note on the um

 Does anybody else have

(1:01:09) like a funny story or something or

 Well I think like dating wise like I definitely have like had casual dates

(1:01:16) but one thing that really happened that was kind of funny is I was um seeing this like country singer and I was at

(1:01:23) this um like award show with him and I literally he was singing at the show and

(1:01:29) so he like went backstage to do his little singing thing and came on stage

(1:01:36) and but I was sitting there Okay What

 i have to let it come through Everyone knows you ain't a virgin red

(1:01:43) dress Hands up

 Also really quick I don't get this Like why are you so defensive it's

(1:01:49) actually when people say that it's a manipulation tactic Like I'm defensive

(1:01:54) because I'm defending myself Like do you want me like what would an innocent person do plead guilty What's an in Oh

(1:02:02) an innocent person would stop talking about it after like two minutes because I honestly dropped it

(1:02:07) So

 I think it's kind of human nature to want to defend yourself when you've been

(1:02:12) falsely accused of something like that's kind of just human nature

 But like this is your show so I really don't want to

(1:02:18) like be like what's it called coming for you or anything So I was just joking

 I'm not upset

 Okay

 I wasn't upset by it I

(1:02:26) was just

 I feel like even if I wasn't a virgin I don't really say I am But like I don't really sleep with people So

 you

(1:02:34) guys want to hug

 if you guys want to check probably wouldn't be because like I said

 is innocent

 You can check

 You can

(1:02:42) check

 You can check how

 there's like a thing you put in Okay guys why do I have to explain what Google thing

(1:02:49) thing

 There's a thing

 My mom is a doctor so I used to spend a lot of time at the hospital

 The Cuban

(1:03:01) healthare

 The doctors are good

 There you go You got the name right

 That can't stand to scrutiny and the blatant hypocrisy

 Yeah

(1:09:49) you kind of are a hypocrite What

 well let's before we get into the alleged

(1:09:55) hypocrisy What are the weak ass opinions that don't stand up to scrutiny let's start there

 Um you got to remind me of

(1:10:02) some of them I'm not keeping it

 It's your claim It's not my job to present to you Well it was your job to present it

(1:10:08) to me just now So present it again What are you talking about

 are you

 It's

(1:10:13) getting so hot over here

 Those weak ass opinions that can't stand to scrutiny That's your claim What are the weak ass

(1:10:22) opinions that can't stand to scrutiny what did you see before you sent that it's bro let her let her answer Go ahead

(1:10:28) She's a woman not a bro It's okay bro But I don't really know what you're

(1:10:34) talking about What's the context what's the topic

 it's literally the words that you wrote

 Okay

 Yeah Here's your

(1:10:39) opportunity I'm right here

 Okay You a hypocrite sometimes but

 Yeah Yeah But what are the weak ass opinions

(1:10:47) one of your opinions was about marriage and how you don't want to get married

(1:10:53) because of money this and money that and how most women they are you know

(1:11:00) always divorcing men and the men to get

(1:11:06) their money taken away I remember that opinion

(1:11:12) but I don't know Is that the weak ass opinion that don't stand to no script

 i mean if you if you gonna back yourself

(1:11:18) up do it now so we could talk about it I mean that's what we

 argument for why it's a weak ass opinion Don't just state

(1:11:24) what the opinion

 keep up with all of your opinions So if you going to bring up the opinion we could talk about it Yeah the marriage one

 What is weak ass

(1:11:30) about the opinion

 oh you taking it personal

 no

 Okay then talk about it What are you talking about

 you have to make

(1:11:36) the argument first So I

 I don't know what you're talking about lady

(1:11:42) Bro this how do you not understand you wrote

 you don't have to make it as difficult as possible You can bring up a

(1:11:48) topic

 Let me get you caught up to speed I got you I'm going to get you caught up to speed

 Perfect

 Though this is what you

(1:11:55) wrote

 You just keep rereading it though You're not seeing

 Yeah because maybe it'll jump start finally You know like we are having technical difficulties

(1:12:01) with the computer We had to restart that [ __ ] at least four times to get it going So I'm going to restart like kind of

(1:12:06) like this with you right now I'm going to restart your brain possibly

(1:12:12) So here's what's going to happen I'mma read it again and it might jumpst start something in there I don't know

 Those

(1:12:17) weak ass opinions that can't stand to scrutiny That's what you wrote

 So how

(1:12:23) does how does his like opinion just let her talk

 i don't know what topic you're talking about I mean cuz sometimes I

(1:12:28) agree with you sometimes I disagree with you So if you're going to bring up a topic we can talk about it But if you just going to keep repeating the same

(1:12:34) question let's move on

 Well I'm asking you to bring up the when you originally wrote this about a month ago be a good

(1:12:41) host or something

 This is being a good host This is great host Great hosting Fantastic hosting The best hosting One

(1:12:47) of the best

 This is the best

 What are I'm literally asking you It's your claim It's your position What are the weak ass

(1:12:55) positions

 i only know about the marriage one but I can't really get into it because I think I kind of agreed with

(1:13:00) your idea about that one So if you're going to bring up something a topic we can talk about it You keep asking the

(1:13:06) same thing I'm going to keep telling you the same thing

 What okay So then moving on to the next thing You said blatant hypocrisy

 What is blatantly hypo

(1:13:13) hypocritical of something I've said or do or whatever

 Um I really don't pay

(1:13:19) attention to what everything you say So you got to bring it up if you want to

 If you're going to call somebody a

(1:13:25) hypocrite and they say "Well okay I'm willing to listen Hear you out What is

(1:13:30) hypocritical of something I've said i'm asking for one thing."

 Okay

 throw one out there

 Those aren't even my words You

(1:13:38) show the DM So you think I'm lying Show the D You think I'm lying

 show the DM Why would I lie it's literally

 I mean if

(1:13:43) you can easily prove it then prove it I'm going to turn it to her and she can confirm it How's that sound

 yeah you can

(1:13:49) show it to everybody at the table

 Is this her Instagram madam Houston Okay correct

 23 Houston El Las Vegas LA

(1:13:58) Occupation me model socialite relationship status madam Wait isn't

(1:14:03) that like a brothel owner okay whatever Number eight Can you read that for me

(1:14:08) into your mic

 sure

 Anything you disagree with the show/host on those weak ass

(1:14:14) opinions that can't stand to scrutiny and the blatant hypocrisy I can confirm

(1:14:19) what is in the DM

 Okay Well I can't I can't talk about every topic because I

(1:14:25) don't remember

 So bring it up Refresh my memory if that's what you here to do

(1:14:31) Here's your here's your opportunity You think I have weak ass opinions that can't stand up to scrutiny i'm giving

(1:14:36) you the floor to articulate those Go ahead

 Okay Bring up a topic Let's talk about it

 It's not my duty to like prompt

(1:14:43) you on the thing that you disagree with me as a host though Now you're confusing me

 If it's a generalized conversation

(1:14:50) but I'm literally prompting you by asking you what is the thing that you disagree with

 I

 My brain hurts

 Okay So

(1:14:58) it's an open-ended question Is there anything he said in the past

 a secondhand question All I'm asking is

(1:15:05) that you explain the topic or bring up a topic cuz I'm not sure I don't keep up with every topic you talk about

 I'm just

(1:15:11) looking for one

 Okay What about body count

 no Well let's not

 body count is so stupid Like I said I ain't never met a

(1:15:17) man that has had sex with a woman and gotten a receipt back

 What does that mean what do you mean a receipt

 like you

() 

(1:15:24) know what I mean like everybody know what you mean

 Nobody knows who had sex with who I mean unless it was filmed or

(1:15:30) unless you popped the baby out your coochie and then that's the only proof of having sex So

 no there could be more

(1:15:36) proof

 And body count is stupid

 Like self admission like I

 like having sex having

(1:15:43) sex with somebody having sex with somebody

 Having sex with somebody the

(1:15:48) same person 300 times is the same difference as 300 people having sex with that one person

 Cuz it's not about the

(1:15:55) body count It's about who has that woman's mind So There's there's other ways to prove it One way to for proof

(1:16:02) would be if a woman admitted to it So if she said "Yes I did in fact sleep with this person." That would be

 correct But

(1:16:09) what does that have to do with what I just said yeah a woman can admit it but why does it matter why does a body count

(1:16:15) matter

 so now we're having a conversation about why body count matters

 No I'm saying body count doesn't

(1:16:20) matter I'm asking you if it matters to you

 What

 now you acting confused

(1:16:28) That is that the thing that So okay What about my position on body count do you think is hypocritical

 i don't know

(1:16:34) What's your position on body count that's what I just asked

 I think it's preferable when you're dating as a man

(1:16:40) to date women with as low a body count as possible That's my position on body count

 But why

(1:16:48) what do you mean why

 so you said you your job as a man is to date women with

(1:16:53) a low body count It it happens to be my preference and I

(1:16:58) prescriptively give advice to men that they should date if you can find women

(1:17:04) to date who have a low body count

 And well what about yours

 well why would that matter

 that's hypocritical right

(1:17:09) there

 That wouldn't be hypocritical

 That is hypocritical because why why should a woman's body count matter

 how much money

(1:17:15) do you make

 you can't Wow Great question Pocket watching is a sin

 Congrats on the reverse Uno Why don't you answer my

(1:17:21) question

 pocket watching is a sin Have you ever dated a man who makes more money than you

 Wow You're a [ __ ]

(1:17:26) hypocrite Except here's the thing

 So you can apply sexual standards to a woman but she can

(1:17:33) apply them to you And then the fact that it matters to you is says more about you because you worried about a woman body

(1:17:40) count And you should be worried about how you can take over her mind not her vagina cuz it ain't about the mind

(1:17:46) That's a bunch of word salad right there I appreciate the word

 Go ahead It's a bunch of word salad to you

 Thank you Appreciate that What does that mean

 bro

(1:17:53) what are you [ __ ]

 Hold on The [ __ ] lady I'm engaged with her That's a super

(1:17:59) chat Relax

 Why are you interrupting the conversation over a super chat that's

(1:18:04) not even going to get read

 cuz this is boring Honestly

 you're boring How about that

 okay

 bro How is it is it boring

() 

(1:18:10) because you're not getting the sufficient level of attention is that why it's boring to you because I think

(1:18:16) the audience thinks that this is far more interesting the conversation that me and her are having versus whatever

(1:18:22) you've talked about thus far

 Okay

 let me ask the chat Chad do you prefer the

(1:18:27) engagement that I'm having with uh Miss Waco

 Madam Madame Waco

 or do you want

(1:18:35) her to derail the conversation and you know maybe it you need you need

(1:18:42) a dose of attention is that it chat Can you give her a little bit of detention maybe give her

 This was an app by the

(1:18:47) way But I was just asking what does Sarah holds me the comment I didn't get it

 bro There's a time and place Try not

(1:18:54) to just like interrupt for like something totally Oh my god bro This

(1:19:00) panel is [ __ ] cooked boys Okay Where were we

(1:19:06) body count was it

 yeah we were talking about body count

(1:19:12) Okay Yeah And you said that you would uh recommend or your preference is dating a woman with a low body count

 Yes Correct

(1:19:18) But your body count doesn't matter That's hypocritical because why why does that woman's body count matter and yours

(1:19:23) doesn't cuz why are you worried about a woman's vagina why am I worried so like it would be

(1:19:29) let's say she has herpes Would that be wrong to me for me to worry about her vagina if it has herpes on it

 see now

(1:19:36) you smearing the conversation cuz I'm talking about having sex with somebody Now we talking about We're talking about

(1:19:42) sexual education

 That has nothing to do with sexual education Do

 if you've had more the more sexual partners you've had

(1:19:49) the greater likelihood of having an STD Statistically yes

 Yes Well yes Logically

(1:19:55) it's possible you've could you could have had sex with 100 people

 You could have had sex with one person and you could have had sex with 300 people and

(1:20:01) been clean

 I get that A girl could have sex one time and get HIV and herpes and

(1:20:06) a woman could have sex

 So you're contradicting yourself What you're saying is stop interrupting you got to stop interrupting So yes it's possible

(1:20:13) that a woman could have slept with a 100 guys and never got an STD That's true But it's more likely like if you're a

(1:20:20) betting man it's more likely that she has an STD if she slept with a bunch of men Whereas if she slept with zero or

(1:20:26) one or just a few

 I'm not familiar with the STD statistics or anything like that

(1:20:32) All I'm saying is that we were talking about body count Then you smeared it to sexual

 I'm happy to get back to that but

(1:20:38) really quick let me ask you a question ask it

 before before we get right back to that If you were a betting person do

(1:20:44) you have savings do you have a savings account Like you got some money saved right

 of

(1:20:50) course

 If you were a betting person and I put two people in front of you one of those people has slept with one person

(1:20:57) and the other individual has slept with a thousand people

(1:21:03) Who would you wager is more likely to have an STD and you're like you're wagering your life savings

 Both of these

(1:21:11) people could have had

 they could but I'm asking you to wager

 That's stupid

(1:21:17) because I like that you like so random and irrelevant

 It's so random and irrelevant because somebody that has had

(1:21:23) a thousand bodies which doesn't even matter could have been protected and it could have been a thousand bodies by 50

(1:21:30) different people

 I'll grant to you it's the dumbest [ __ ] question that's ever been asked Answer it anyways I'm not

(1:21:37) wagering that I mean it's kind of like I'm not picking

 You've got to pick one So would it be a would you rather if

(1:21:43) it's a would you rather I'd answer cuz I No it's which would you wager your life

(1:21:48) savings on well I'm going assume that the person that has a thousand a thousand bodies is

(1:21:56) you know sexually educated So I would hope that you know they are safe and

(1:22:03) clean you know Strap it up guys

 Um so I would bet on $1,000 I would bet on a

(1:22:09) thousand bodies because somebody with a one body that don't make them clean And not to say that they're dirty but that

(1:22:15) doesn't make them free of sexually transmitted diseases That's it's stupid and it's irrelevant

(1:22:24) Maybe the person that sleeps with one person

 Great line of argumentation there Uh okay So why else does body count

(1:22:30) matter is that why you're curious about it

 oh I said body count doesn't matter In my opinion

 you So what do we If you

(1:22:37) Okay body count doesn't matter Okay cool Why

 that's a childish and it's a

(1:22:43) childish question First of all how many of you are keeping up with how many people y'all slept with that's so high

(1:22:49) school to me

 So you've forgotten how many people you've slept with

 I don't keep count

 Right You don't keep count

(1:22:54) because you've forgotten Cuz there's been so many

 Are you calling

() 

(1:23:00) me a [ __ ] how's that calling you a [ __ ]

 i'm just [ __ ] with you

 But yes

(1:23:07) pretty much

 I am not a [ __ ] I am a woman who respects my body And just because a

(1:23:13) woman is you know free sexually does not mean that she is a [ __ ]

(1:23:19) How many people have you slept with can I ask that

 he's a hypocrite He will never answer that

 That wouldn't make me

(1:23:25) a hypocrite

 I'm curious I'm very curious But you expect to know a woman's body count

 Reveal that He you expect to know

(1:23:31) a woman's body count because you too worried about her vagina and not how you can control her mind not how you control her as a person You're saying control

(1:23:38) I'm saying control because it's not about control

 But what if those two are Hold on You're making actually I would

(1:23:44) make the argument it's less to do with the physic like the vagina and it's more

(1:23:49) to do actually with

 I just said the same thing

 right but you're saying that my position leans more towards I'm really

(1:23:57) concerned with her vagina Yeah cuz why are you asking about this woman's body

(1:24:02) and not her mind

 does that matter to you all you care about is a woman's vagina

(1:24:08) which is probably probably why you barely had a successful relationship Where you are you just pulling that wait

(1:24:14) that's rich coming from the woman mind you who's never had a relationship

 and I've had I'm I am a I am a psychology

(1:24:22) major I study the mind and behavior of people for a living

 Which which university are you doing that for texas

(1:24:28) Southern University

 Wow They should uh Tigers It's a good school

 Go Tigers

 They should probably get their certification

(1:24:34) or whatever it's called revoked because they've done a it's been a complete catastrophic failure in terms of uh your

(1:24:40) education I guess But um I'm actually as it relates to body

(1:24:46) count it's less to do with her body and more to do actually with her mind

 We're

(1:24:51) saying the same thing Ryan

 Right But you're saying you're saying I'm focused

(1:24:57) on her body

 You're focused on a woman's vagina because you're saying that you

(1:25:02) prefer a woman with a low body count What does that mean to you a woman with a low body count that she's barely had

(1:25:07) sex with people A bunch of

 she's had sex with fewer men Okay So you're proving my point What are you talking about

(1:25:15) how do you go about finding out how many she says something about you or how does

(1:25:22) how do men find out about her body type correct If you don't know any of the guys she knows then I mean my only

(1:25:28) assumption is the only way is to go be like "Hey my friend I just wanted to write you and see if she slept with you

(1:25:34) and your friend and this." How do you find out is it just word of mouth that you could ask you could ask but we

(1:25:41) discussed that earlier and you said that it's hard to believe that somebody who does what she does would be capable of

(1:25:47) telling the truth on that

 Well there's a differentiation when we're I mean I it

(1:25:52) still stands to reason that somebody who's engaged in sex work

 for even

(1:25:57) personal gain on a private

 uh individual level would lie about their body count

(1:26:03) to a prospective partner But that's different than coming on a podcast and

(1:26:09) lying about it for some other different sort of game I get what you're saying But yes you could ask a girl you're

(1:26:15) interested in and she's interested in you

 You could ask her what her body count is Now she could I agree with you

(1:26:21) She could lie

 and you would never know You would never know if she lied about it Let's be honest Well I mean there's

(1:26:26) there's certain other ways that you can sort of navigate that I think to arrive

(1:26:32) at a uh not an exact answer but have a sense for her past promiscuity That doesn't

(1:26:40) involve directly asking about her body count but hopefully I mean you guys say

(1:26:46) she should lie and I would just point out and say well that's a terrible basis for starting a terrible foundation for

(1:26:52) starting a relationship You've started your relationship on a lie

(1:26:57) True

 But people do lie all the time So I agree with you that women can lie about their body count I don't think they

(1:27:03) should In the same way that I don't think men should lie about certain things that uh women might care about

(1:27:08) that women find important to know about a uh

 potential future boyfriend

 Yeah

(1:27:16) True true true Uh okay So again I'd like to bring it

(1:27:22) back to you though since this is your claim that you stated You say "I have weak ass opinions that

(1:27:29) can't stand to scrutiny and the blatant hypocrisy." So what is blatantly hypocritical or what are my opinions

(1:27:37) that can't stand to scrutiny

 well as I just said you were so concerned about a woman's preference when or your

(1:27:43) preference as a woman

 I'm not really keeping up with the topic So if you want to bring something else up we could talk

(1:27:49) about It's not Bro are you

 Don't calm down Getting flustered over there

 No

(1:27:58) you're the one making the claim So if you're going to make some sort of

(1:28:06) accusation about something then the burden is on you to actually make a

(1:28:13) claim and back it up

 Okay I just made one

(1:28:20) Well I had to prompt you on it So I'm But I'm asking you is there anything else

 i mean when if uh one comes up I'll

(1:28:26) call you out on it Okay We have Lucas here It's patently

(1:28:32) obvious that chair 2 has guzzled a boatload of low low IQ spooge Is this

(1:28:37) true

 low IQ spooge

 Yep

 I'm a college

(1:28:43) educated woman Whatever the hell that is supposed to mean take that [ __ ] back to your mom accreditation I think is what I

(1:28:49) was going for They should revoke the uh accreditation to for that particular institution

 obvious

 All right Uh

 word

(1:28:58) but so you don't have anything

(1:29:04) Okay Watch Check this out

 Madam

 Madam Houston

 Madam Fort Lauderdale or I don't

(1:29:11) No that's my bad Madam

 Florida Okay Let's not bring Florida into this

(1:29:19) Um I think you abuse children

 Oh my god that's a interesting claim

 Disprove to

(1:29:26) me that you abuse children Well that should be easy

 Prove to me

() 

(1:29:31) that you don't abuse children

 I don't abuse children There's my proof

(1:29:38) But I think you abuse children Okay

 Okay

 Think all think whatever you

(1:29:44) want I tell you I don't abuse children But you would agree that it would be the burden would be on me to prove that you

(1:29:50) abuse children Like I can't just say that You'd be like "Okay what proof do you have of that?"

(1:29:58) You don't have proof So what are we talking about

 okay So you've asserted claims

(1:30:04) blatant hypocrisy weak ass weak ass opinions that don't

(1:30:09) stand up to scrutiny You forwarded those claims

(1:30:14) back them up with like one thing

 I already did your your um

 my position on

(1:30:20) body count

 Your position on your preference with women Okay You you pointed out that I have a

(1:30:27) position on that

 Cuz you said

 "Why is the weak aspect?"

 Those are your words What what are

 Why are we talking in

(1:30:34) circles what are my words let's move on already

 What are my words

 you said you prefer a woman with a lower body count

(1:30:40) Did you not say that

 yeah Why

 okay So you said that

 Yeah Okay

 Okay Ready for step two ready for step two Why does

(1:30:47) that not stand up to scrutiny scrutinize it

 You said hypocrisy It's a

(1:30:52) hypocrite You're a hypocrite

 How would that be a hypocrite

 because you're worried about a woman's body count when

(1:30:57) you can't even speak uh speak on your own

 How would that be hypocritical

(1:31:04) are you acting stupid on purpose or

 No you have to No it's because I I reject

(1:31:10) that it's hypocritical You're going to have to explain how it's hypocritical Well I just said it for everybody

(1:31:17) watching Like you said you prefer a woman and it just feels like I'm

(1:31:22) repeating myself You said you prefer women body counts correct

 So you said that

(1:31:28) You got me Yeah I did say it

 Check mark Congrats What's your body count

 how would that matter and I'm How would that

(1:31:34) check mark you aren't you aren't disclosing your body count So that's hypocritical cuz why are you worried

(1:31:40) about a woman's body count when you can't even disclose your own

 hold on That wouldn't be hypocrisy

 That's not

(1:31:45) hypocrisy to you

 What is the definition of hypocrisy since you got your doctor no no no It's my job to define hypocrisy

(1:31:52) Explain what hypocrisy is

 It's not my job to define hypocrisy You're the one who brought the claim It's your job to

(1:31:59) define hypocrisy

 Claims were made They were stated Completed

 Yeah Define hypocrisy Then

 next question to

 Is it

(1:32:06) because you don't know why don't you define hypocrisy

 next question Oh my I Oh it's your podcast Okay No no

(1:32:14) define hypocrisy I'm just telling you You are a hypocrite when it comes to a woman in her body but

(1:32:20) not yours So wait So okay hold on Let me see if I understand this logic So

(1:32:32) have you ever dated a guy who makes more money than you

 yeah Okay Does that make

(1:32:37) you a hypocrite what does that have to do with being a hypocrite

 okay So essentially you're trying to get at hey Brian I think that

(1:32:44) you've slept with X number of women Maybe you have a high body count perhaps I'm not guessing your body count and I

(1:32:50) don't care to I just asked you a simple question You didn't want to answer it but you answered my question about your

(1:32:55) preference to women but you logic is faulty Are you refusal my refusal to

(1:33:01) reveal my body count wouldn't point towards a hypocritical stance on my

(1:33:07) preference towards women who have a low body count

 So you can apply that standard to women but you're aren't

(1:33:14) disclosing it for your own sake

 Oh but you're going to have to grant this Are

(1:33:19) you a hypocrite for wanting to date a man who makes more money than you i am

(1:33:24) not a hypocrite because whatever a man wants to provide for me that's his

(1:33:30) choice

 Okay Then any virgin or low body count women who want to date me it's

(1:33:36) also their choice

 Correct It's all about choice

 But if it doesn't make you when it comes to dating it's all about choice

(1:33:42) I'm just calling you a hypocrite because that's what you are

 How would it again you can have a choice and be a hypocrite

(1:33:48) at the same time Brian

 congrats You can use a word but I don't think you really have an understanding of it You're going

(1:33:53) to have to present and articulate a definition of hypocrisy that computes

(1:33:58) with your allegation that I'm a hypocrite

 The definition of hypocrisy is when you are calling out somebody else

(1:34:05) in a wrong way and you do the same thing I didn't even do that though

 Okay

 here here's my claim I prefer to date women

(1:34:13) with low body counts So what is the thing on my end that I'm doing that

(1:34:18) would make me a hypocrite so you let's say what is your body count what type of

(1:34:25) nerd keeps up with their body count anyway okay

(1:34:31) What's your body count since that's the question

 No the question was what makes him a hypocrite

(1:34:37) No I'm asking the question count is the part where it makes him hypocritical because there's

(1:34:42) no answer there Sorry

 Exactly

 Let me ask you this Let's get to the point

 Hold on Hold on Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop Stop

(1:34:49) Stop Let's say I don't want to reveal my body count but the body count is zero for

(1:34:54) example

 Okay

 I'm not saying that's what it is but let's say it's zero

 Okay

 but I'm still refusing to answer your

(1:35:01) question How then am I a hypocrite if my body count is actually zero but I'm just

(1:35:06) by virtue of me refusing to answer your question it makes me a hypocrite to desire a woman who has a low body count

(1:35:12) Why would that be hypocritical

 so would you want a woman to disclose her body count when she as she's dating you hold

(1:35:18) on There's a difference between being on a date I

 It's a question All you have to do is answer it

 If I was privately

(1:35:24) one-on-one with a girl and she asked me my my body count I would tell it to her But now we're on a podcast So me not

(1:35:31) wanting to reveal my body count on the podcast doesn't have anything to do with me being a hypocrite for stating my

(1:35:38) preference for desiring women with a low body count

 What man keeps up with their body

 as long as you're revealing it

 Oh

(1:35:44) my god bro actually Is this the topic that was like you

(1:35:49) messaged him that

 hold on I'm going to read this

 It was like May 29th

 There's a video circling on X right now of a woman

(1:35:55) who cleaned her entire Bumble Dates house thinking she watched the pod Oh that's based Yo Tony Stark By the way I

(1:36:02) apologize guys that it's not going to read out as a TTS so I'm just going to have to um and also there were some tens

(1:36:08) that are just going to come through that are below the threshold but uh so thank you guys for these Tony Stark thank I'm

(1:36:14) just going to have to read the TTS I'm not sure why Again I apologize We had some technical difficulties before the show so the audio is kind of bugged but

(1:36:21) uh thank you Tony Stark for that Appreciate Appreciate it Uh well I'll have to maybe send it to me and I'll

(1:36:27) maybe have it ready for next show Okay Well I'm not getting anywhere with that So um

 we're not having an argument We're

(1:36:33) just having a conversation Houston we do have a problem

(1:36:38) Oh my god car over here Is that supposed to be

(1:36:45) Texas

 like the first black lady

(1:36:51) All right

(1:36:57) It's like I I don't know how to explain it to you What I was saying is I'm confused Is

(1:37:03) that why you reached out to him like your DM was that like the specific topic that you had in mind

 it's one of the things that she responded with

 Yeah when

(1:37:11) I stated my claim you keep talking in circles so we can just move on or you

(1:37:16) want to talk about it but I thought I was here to have a conversation

 I just want to probe the logic a bit here Do you think when it comes to the criminal

(1:37:22) justice system do you think that the state the the burden of proof falls on

(1:37:28) the state to prove someone guilty of a crime i'm not really familiar with the law or

(1:37:35) anything like that so I'm not going to speak on something that I don't know about

 Okay Well here I'll pro

(1:37:41) really Okay I if the state wanted to accuse you of

(1:37:47) murder they would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they've accused

(1:37:53) you of murder right like they wouldn't just be like "We accuse you of murder

(1:37:58) Now you need to prove that you're innocent." They have to prove that you're guilty of

(1:38:05) the crime beyond a reasonable doubt Okay lucas that's called an ad homonym Wrong

(1:38:16) Ah boy All right Do you want to answer the question though

 i mean you said to

(1:38:23) call you out on it I did You do You disagree

 You didn't even No you didn't even have anything I think she like

(1:38:29) offered up the body

 Yeah because I told you I'm not keeping up with every topic you're talking about

 Yeah but I'm just asking you for one

 I already brought it

(1:38:35) up and I told you brought it up I told you about the marriage one I said I I thought I agreed with your opinion on

(1:38:41) marriage but I couldn't think of anything else All right sounds good Let's move on

 We have Pelagic Chair 2 is

(1:38:47) going through all the hoops of gaslighting deflection and projection to avoid accountability and justify her

(1:38:52) promiscuity Typical loser work That's from Pelagic Thank you man for the super chat Appreciate it Pelagic chair 2

(1:38:58) student of psychology My ass thick as cold molasses Okay thank you

 Thank you guys Madam Houston everywhere

(1:39:06) love the attention

 Lucas chair 2 [ __ ] pay attention to quotequo fallacy is a

(1:39:12) logical fallacy that occurs when someone tries to discredit an argument by pointing out the speaker's hypocrisy It

(1:39:17) yep it is facious It doesn't address the actual merits of the argument but instead attacks the person making the

(1:39:24) argument appeal to hypocrisy Yep Well put Lucas Do you want to respond to Lucas

(1:39:31) lucas you're ugly Wait hold on First off

(1:39:37) first off he's a very handsome guy He's My hairline is crooked Lucas you need a

(1:39:43) new barber

 Thin lip ass

 Here why don't you pull up can you show us your hairline show us your hairline

 What

(1:39:50) about yours it's kind of receding over there You didn't lose it almost

 I got I

(1:39:55) all the stress show I got like three months left and it's all gone probably Uh thank you Lucas All right Christopher

(1:40:01) Uh sleeping with the same person 300 times would demonstrate loyalty and value valuing a stable relationship

(1:40:07) Sleeping with 300 different people would demonstrate you can't be loyal and that you don't value stable relationships

(1:40:13) which would make for a better role model for a child Do you want to respond to that one

 sleeping with the same person

(1:40:19) 300 times would demonstrate loyalty and valuing a st stable relationship It

(1:40:25) really just depends on the relationship that these two people have together Now sleeping with 300 different people would

(1:40:32) demonstrate Where did that comment go

 oh okay You need you need a little refresher course

(1:40:39) We really needed that whiteboard I was talking about earlier right we need

(1:40:46) uh looks like we no longer have it Oh wait Here it is Go ahead Yeah I would say the same thing though A

(1:40:53) woman floating around you know trying to find a you know somebody or a woman

(1:40:59) floating around with different people 300 different people at a time shows that this woman has not

(1:41:06) submitted or attached herself to one person that can you know that she can

(1:41:12) trust and that she can you know that she can trust And

(1:41:18) [Music] I know I know I know So psychologist making stuff

(1:41:24) A woman sleeping with 300 different people does show that she cannot be loyal I get it Yeah I agree with the

(1:41:30) statement

 All right that was great Okay guys if you want uh so the TTS is broken

(1:41:36) so it's going to be instant read versus batched read Uh $200 in instant read

(1:42:39) Speaking of I want to do a little brief uh I got to discuss something about the Discord in the Discord We're gonna go to

(1:42:46) the uh wall of I think it's the wall of whatever I think uh so guys last Sunday

() 

(1:42:55) I mentioned this on last Sunday's stream we had a uh a girl who was scheduled to

(1:43:01) be on today but she cancelled And her reason for cancelling

(1:43:06) is one of the top I've I've gone some crazy [ __ ] Some girl said she just got lip filler and her lips were all still

(1:43:13) [ __ ] up and so she had to cancel Some girl oh going on a date with a billionaire Fake

(1:43:19) news All fake news right this is one of the wildest cancellations I've ever dealt with Pull

(1:43:26) it up So Discord Uh okay So we're going to So okay

(1:43:32) She was scheduled to be on today guys So I'm gonna get try to get through this quickly but click the fourth one first

(1:43:38) for context Okay actually I might pull that one up

(1:43:44) So exile that Okay so do the first one So I need to

(1:43:49) give you guys a bit of context So all all the people who ever come on the show we send them a bunch of pre-show information It's like parag it's a novel

(1:43:57) We send them a novel of you know all all the details blah blah blah So we got the dress code you know don't wear uh heels

(1:44:05) boots hats no sho uh wear comfortable shoes Uh and then at the very bottom

(1:44:11) though where I want to draw your attention at the very bottom it says please no glasses if possible and if you

(1:44:18) have contacts or can go without And now the reason we do this is because when

(1:44:23) people wear glasses it hides their eyes and then it casts reflection it casts glare Uh we want to be able to for for

(1:44:30) our production quality we want to be able to see people's faces We want to be able to see their eyes when they show up

(1:44:36) Some people have tried to show up wearing sunglasses and stuff Uh we want to see their face We want to see their eyes Uh pull up the next one

(1:44:43) All right So here's the messages All right So I sent her the the previous one was just me sending her the show

(1:44:49) information This is back uh on Sunday of last week She writes "Thank the heads up I just wanted to be clear that wearing

(1:44:56) my glasses isn't a preference or an option I always need it in order to be

(1:45:02) able to see my surroundings words and the people around me I don't wear contacts because I feel more comfortable

(1:45:07) wearing my glasses To which I respond that's fine if you need them indicating

(1:45:12) that given what she wrote there we're fine with her needing glasses And if you

(1:45:18) actually go back to the original just go back one to the previous message you'll see please no glasses if possible

(1:45:25) indicating if you know if you need glasses we'll accept it So go forward

(1:45:31) All right So this is the kind of [ __ ] I'm dealing with before the show Then she writes "Yes I need them because I use my Actually we need a girl

(1:45:38) to read this Can you read this?"

 Yeah sure

 You're reading the girl parts

 Okay

(1:45:43) Starting with the Yes

 Mhm

 Okay Yes I need them because I use my glasses for everyday function I was quite caught off

(1:45:50) guard over the fact that your team doesn't want their female guests to wear glasses Is there a reason for that

 to

(1:45:56) which I respond as stated if you need them that's fine You can wear them And then the the framing of her statement

(1:46:04) there was don't want their female guests I was like okay that's kind of weird So I say "We prefer any of our guests

(1:46:11) regardless of whether they are male male or female if they can to not wear glasses." And I explain to her why They

(1:46:17) cast glare and block hide the eyes face but if it's a necessity then of course we are fine with it

(1:46:25) So the first message like when I'm responding that should have been like problem solved I'm like it's fine if you

(1:46:30) wear glasses but she wants to be a Karen No offense to the multiple Karens at the table

 Oh no No and then uh read this

(1:46:38) next part

 Respectfully I've worked in the creative space long enough to know that I can wear glasses when film

(1:46:44) filming on set I always make it known when I apply for a project in gigs that

(1:46:50) I wear prescription glasses I'm pretty sure she wears glasses Most of the production teams well she did that wrong

(1:46:57) Team that I've collaborated with I've never had a problem with or have never had a problem with me wearing glasses If

(1:47:03) anything they'd ask me how to best accommodate me So due to this new information that was just brought to my

(1:47:10) attention last minute I would like to decline on this opportunity

 All right So

(1:47:16) a couple things there I sent this show information to I think it was either

(1:47:22) Saturday or Sunday of last week So I don't know if this is exactly last minute because that gave her you know a

(1:47:29) week before the show And then she said that she always makes it known when she

(1:47:35) applies for a project gig that she wears prescription glasses Skip forward two Nick

(1:47:40) Yeah Yeah So this is her messages to us So she was going to show up with this friend whatever Uh nowhere in her

(1:47:48) messages anywhere And there any other messages does she ever say anything about her like her wearing glasses are a

(1:47:56) necessity She doesn't disclose So go back to no disclosure about the glasses thing

(1:48:02) but uh and you're going to have to move me over to the other side

(1:48:08) So she's So I respond "Please point out when you applied for this gig that you

(1:48:14) wear prescription glasses because she makes a claim." She always makes it known She didn't make it known Uh and if

(1:48:21) she had made it known we would have been fine with it as evidenced by the

(1:48:26) original message that says it's if possible That means it's hey if you need it it's okay And then I repeat it

(1:48:33) multiple times here So I say you're fighting a phantom We said we are fine with you wearing your glasses Even in

(1:48:39) the pre-show notes we sent you it states "Please no glasses Emphasis if possible." In this case you need your

(1:48:45) glasses and we've repeatedly stated we are fine with you wearing your glasses

(1:48:50) and then bring me back over to the other side and then

(1:48:56) tab over for the rest of the conversation and then read this

 Oh my gosh

 And then

(1:49:03) every casting process your team takes a look at each person's application and pictures before choosing who they decide

(1:49:10) to let on their show It's clear that I wear glasses in almost every picture Your team never initially stated during

(1:49:17) the casting process please no glasses if possible I reread the message from the

(1:49:25) very beginning you just started this today All right

 Started this today

 So then I

(1:49:31) you know I'm I'm not going to read all that but you're welcome to read it But basically I just then I just start

(1:49:36) arguing with her and and just uh I think I called her a Karen Did I Where is it

(1:49:44) trying to be a Karen Yeah

 Oh yeah Yeah Yeah Uh put And then um there's no need

(1:49:49) to be then she responds

 here I'll [ __ ] it I'll just read it Oh the goalposter shifting It went from I always make it

(1:49:56) known when I apply for projects gigs that I wear prescription glasses to well you should have known because my

(1:50:02) Instagram profile and in our initial messages with you we also didn't state the other numerous pre-show instructions

(1:50:08) either and when you show up in person we also go over best practices during the shoot So what I'm pointing out there is

(1:50:14) uh even if we don't disclose in initial messages that doesn't preclude us from stating like in studio like all of you

(1:50:21) were here We stated like additional rules that we didn't previously like feel the need to disclose to you like

(1:50:27) prior to you coming into studio And then I'm like what are you even arguing about lady i call her Karen You're painting

(1:50:34) yourself as a victim And I repeat again we're fine with you wearing glasses You're blowing this out of proportion Yo

(1:50:40) Chad what's it called when somebody wants to to like you've made it good like you've

(1:50:48) you've cleared the air and they're like "No I want to argue more

 beating a dead horse

 because I made it clear that we

(1:50:55) were fine with her wearing glasses." Right so this is just like the [ __ ] and dumbassery that I'm dealing with Uh

(1:51:01) read that last part There's no need to be disrespectful and rude towards me when I'm just trying to be clear about

(1:51:07) the importance of why I need to wear my glasses I wanted to make sure that we

(1:51:12) came from a mutual place of understanding There is no need to come across hostile and mean Your team is

(1:51:18) always looking for someone who has a difference of opinion and who challenges your points of views Yet when someone

(1:51:24) tries to bring up a point you seem to deflect and pin it against them I wish you all the best And then move me to the

(1:51:31) other side real quick

 Oh and then I just say "I wear glasses by

(1:51:36) the way I bet my prescription is worse than yours guys I wear contacts."

(1:51:42) And when I'm not uh doing the show I'm pretty much in glasses 24/7 My

(1:51:47) prescription is worse than hers So I don't know if she's trying to do some like woke victim

(1:51:53) like she's a marginalized because she wears prescription glasses or something

(1:51:59) Can I just say

 well one thing one thing we'll get to it pull it back up though really quick

(1:52:06) uh tab over back one

(1:52:11) So again she brings it to my attention honestly even in our initial messages

(1:52:16) where I say if possible it shouldn't have even been an issue I say that's fine if you need them I repeat it

(1:52:23) multiple times What chat what is the name for when someone does this where

(1:52:28) it's like you've solved the problem like the problem has been solved and they're

(1:52:34) like I mean they're being a caring I I don't know I want to speak to your manager I don't know I am the manager

(1:52:39) [ __ ] Um I don't know That shit's weird But and then um exile that And then but

(1:52:47) then she blocked me and then she she started leaking uh the DMs and losing her [ __ ] Um

(1:52:55) she yeah she overlooked the practical resolution that I offered Um so click on

(1:53:02) that first one Nick in the new batch Uh when they asked me last minute I mean

(1:53:09) you it wasn't last minute lady It wasn't like the day of uh she wears prescription glasses She made that clear

(1:53:15) She didn't make it clear Uh they questioned it Where did I I don't know you guys saw that When did I question it

(1:53:21) when did I question her wearing glasses this is female gaslighting bro This is

(1:53:26) important in dating because a girl like this let me relate it to dating bro She'll falsely accuse you of some [ __ ]

(1:53:32) bro Those type of women do avoid accountability of course So you got to

(1:53:38) be careful because those type of women look for problems and you can't chase that problem as a man You got to let that [ __ ] be

 That's true Shit's true

(1:53:45) man Pull that [ __ ] back up Pull it back up uh shifted blame and got dis

(1:53:52) disrespectful when I stood my ground Look here's what I don't understand Um and maybe one of cuz I'm not you know

(1:53:58) maybe this is how like y'all are women so you can explain to me what she was trying to do Maybe I don't know

 No

 But

(1:54:06) wasn't the problem solved when I was like "It's fine if you wear your glasses."

 You said it was okay

 The

(1:54:12) problem was solved after you sent that first message all that extra stuff after that It was just her being a woman and

(1:54:18) an emotional creature

 is that she wasn't wearing her glasses when she was reading your messages

(1:54:23) She all my name is Karen and you asked me to take my glasses off and I sat him down and you keep saying her name is

(1:54:30) Karen You keep calling her Karen Karen took her glasses off

 She's a cop She could arrest us all and call her Karen

(1:54:37) Okay

 This girl sounds like a a liberal Well we're about to get into that Yeah

(1:54:43) we're about to get into that cuz I'm going to show you I'll say it

 how crazy this woman is Uh pull it back up though

(1:54:49) Isn't it funny

 this wasn't Wait

 So by the way I mean this is totally a mis

(1:54:54) like that second sentence Total mischaracterization Uh she didn't make it clear There was no

(1:55:00) communications that it was anyways whatever She then they questioned it

(1:55:07) There was no questioning of her wearing the glasses I said she could wear the glasses

(1:55:13) shifted the blame There was no blame shift She was just being obnoxious And then finally I was just like started

(1:55:20) arguing with her just because it was fun And then I was like "Okay." Cuz she said she's not going to do the show

 What are the time stamps on the messages like

(1:55:26) when was that going back and forth was it like at night time

 it was No it was Sunday like right before last Sunday's

(1:55:32) show Oh wow So a week ago

 And then she says it wasn't about glasses [ __ ] Yes

(1:55:38) it was It was about control What

 we literally said she could

(1:55:44) literally said she could wear the glasses I wasn't trying to control her I don't shrink myself for anyone's brand

(1:55:50) If advocating for yourself makes people uncomfortable let them be Okay Next This is a huge red flag

 After being

(1:55:57) asked last minute by the whatever podcast to avoid wearing my prescription glasses if possible and that they'd

(1:56:03) prefer if I'd wear some contacts I respectfully declined Blah blah blah More comfortable wearing glasses I

(1:56:08) explained I told them "Yeah okay." That wear glasses for Yeah of course bro It's

(1:56:14) cuz your vision's bad No [ __ ] Oh my Which was evident from the start No it wasn't lady Yeah you had glasses on in

(1:56:22) your [ __ ] profile But oh my Okay When I stood when I stood by that I was met

(1:56:28) with push back and unprofessional behavior

 Oh my god

 Hold on Pull Brush

(1:56:35) back Exile that Pull up pull up the uh the the Yeah that one That's fine if you

(1:56:41) need them [ __ ] What is the [ __ ] Hello What is And then she she

 she could

(1:56:48) have just

 This is a woman No I I know this is like not really a dating thing but trust me

(1:56:56) dudes have you dated a girl like this where it's like

 you fixing the problem isn't good enough So like a girl like

(1:57:03) this gentleman will and this applies to women too If you're dealing with a dude that that's

(1:57:10) just wants to like find conflict it's a major red flag Um pull it back up though

(1:57:18) Or the original one I think or the the number two there That's fine if you need

(1:57:23) them As stated if you need them that's fine

(1:57:29) Uh and then below there's Okay bring it back to the other one

(1:57:34) Where are we yeah Push back Uh respect goes both ways And

(1:57:40) I felt a little disrespected with the female guest thing Like it was like a sexist thing Like oh we let the men wear

(1:57:47) whatever If setting a boundary makes someone uncomfortable bro we were Oh my god bro This girl is going to falsely

(1:57:55) accuse somebody This is dangerous [ __ ] She's going to Okay What next

(1:58:02) Oh and then she shows the whole she shows the whole uh back and forth Next

(1:58:08) Yeah just next That's We already showed it Uh this is from her point of view Uh

(1:58:14) next she So she blocked after she sent that Uh and then a friend of mine reached out

(1:58:20) to me out of the blue because once she heard the blah blah blah she wanted to give me a heads up about the type of

(1:58:26) environment that I would be walking into This is why it's so important to speak up about what happens behind the scenes

(1:58:32) This is what women supporting women supporting women She [ __ ] the woman thing up

 It should be This is what women

(1:58:40) me supporting women looks like Oh my god Wait can I play some [ __ ] hold on

 Wait Brian can you rate us anybody

(2:08:22) maybe We'll see

 Maybe not actually I don't know Take a zero That's okay You don't have

(2:08:27) to

 I could do it

 Only if only if you guys want me to rate you though

 I think I want it

 You want it oh yeah She Oh

(2:08:34) calm down there

 Calm down Uh what about you give us a 10 A female 10

(2:08:41) that you think is a 10

 Um okay So I would say well like

(2:08:48) let me think Oh Natalie um Portman Salahek uh Angelina Jolie

 I mean there's

(2:08:56) so many Marilyn Monroe But um the reason they're tens is because of their facial

(2:09:01) symmetry So that's what defines a 10 is your facial symmetry is even throughout

(2:09:07) So that's how I know that we both

 I think there's other components besides just face facial symmetry

 Um what kind

(2:09:15) of beauty are you defining a physical body or um because everybody

 well there's face and then there's body

 right

(2:09:22) those would be different I guess

 Yeah they would be

 like somebody could have a tent face but like a bad body or like a

(2:09:27) 10 body but a bad face

 Yeah Oh you see it a lot

 Yep I mean but you know hey a

(2:09:33) great body is a great body

 right can't say that about me either

 And tell us uh what waste

(2:09:42) Don't get ahead of yourself huh

 i'm already there

 What's What's a a male 10 for you

 a male 10

 A guy who you think is

(2:09:48) a 10

 Oh I said Kiana Reeves

 K Reeves That's right Yeah

 Do you think you could land Jordan yes I definitely could

(2:09:56) You're pretty confident that

 I'm very confident Why if that's uh you haven't slid into his DMs though or

 No I haven't

(2:10:02) because I have no need to

 So if you saw Kiana Ree interested in doing that right now but

(2:10:08) you're giving me ideas I think I should maybe

 Okay And you think you could get

(2:10:13) Chestnut

 i think so

 Uh who was the other guy channing Tatum

 Channing Tatum Yeah I

(2:10:19) hope he like Black Girls

 Mhm If you saw our DMs you would know that all of us

(2:10:24) could probably do that with a lot of your celebrity uh like

 top people

(2:10:29) Definitely

 Well you have some It looks like you're looking at me like you have something to say

 No

 You have something on this

 no

 Tell us how you really feel

(2:10:37) I don't know if like we're just going off looks and personality because I find that just looks

 cuz I feel like

(2:10:44) personality would would be a big thing Like if I got to know Keano Reeves and he was a [ __ ] I'd be like "Oh you're

(2:10:49) not that attractive." Women can be a flawless 10 but if

(2:10:55) they're not very intelligent for me like I I wouldn't find them that attractive Right

 Yeah I agree with you that there's

(2:11:02) more to attraction than just looks Correct They're a terrible person

 Beauty quality function But I definitely am not

(2:11:09) settling for ugly You can also have like an uglyish guy that has like like a very confident attitude and that makes him

(2:11:14) like look hotter

 Yeah

 Well it's like initial attraction like just looking at someone walking down the street like you

(2:11:20) know what I mean like that's But Keanu has a reputation for having a

(2:11:26) sterling

 Yeah

 uh personality

 Yes Yes That's why he's a 10 also I mean part of

(2:11:32) why he's a 10 I also just like tall pale long-haired guys I don't know why

(2:17:41) whole smile on my face We all ugly to somebody but not me though

(2:17:49) disagree with that Uh do we have Are you pulling up the

(2:17:54) Discord no I got rid of it What do you want

 the

(2:17:59) Discord the

 four

 age advancements

 Can we

(2:18:04) get those going the age advance and the gender swaps going around the table Do you think you'll be better looking in 10

() 

(2:18:10) years time hopefully like my mama and my dad I hope

(2:18:16) so I think I'll be better looking Okay Uh so better look You'll be better

(2:18:23) looking at 46

 Yeah I mean I look better now than I did when I was 26 so

(2:18:30) I think it will I'll just keep trending hopefully

 Okay

 What about 20 years time

(2:18:36) will you be better looking at 56

 well okay Like are you talking about on the scale of like generally like general

(2:18:41) beauty scale or are you talking about like you put myself when I'm like 66

(2:18:47) next to myself today when I'm 36 and like you're asking who's prettier

(2:18:53) yeah Oh me to like today Yeah cuz like I think like I feel like I'm in my prime

(2:19:00) like

 Okay So

 so not better looking at 46 than you are now

 If you're judging it

(2:19:06) against like a previous age then yes Like I think or sorry if you're judging

(2:19:11) like my 46-year-old self against my 36-year-old self I would think the

(2:19:17) 36-year-old self was like met more beauty standards than I might care about when I'm 46

(2:19:25) Wait so hold on

 I know this is going to get confusing

 Will you be better looking at 46 than you are now yes or no

 no

(2:19:31) probably not

 Okay realistically but you're uh if we go back 10 years 26 versus 36

 I'm definitely better looking

(2:19:37) now than I was when I was 26 Like okay better looking now You're 23 Will

(2:19:43) you be better looking in 10 years time at 33

 i know I'm aging like one

(2:19:48) You are

 Okay Okay 20 years time at 43 Better looking at 43

 You still talking

(2:19:54) to me

 yeah I am I'm a age like fine mine I take care of my body I don't put trash in my body So I expect to look fine all

(2:20:02) my for the rest of my life And even when I do get a little ugly that's what plastic surgery is for

 Okay Uh 30 years

(2:20:08) time at 53 will you be better looking than you are now

 uh yep

 40 years time 63

(2:20:14) better looking

 i don't have a problem I'm continuously evolving and getting finer and finer

(2:20:20) When's your peak going to be

 i won't have a peak because I'mma always be sexy

(2:20:25) I want this attitude Okay

 So 73 Better looking

 Well then

(2:20:32) that's going to start to you know naturally I'm going start to sag but that's what plastic surgery is for You know lift it up a little bit pull his

(2:20:37) face back a little bit Okay 83

(2:20:43) Uh I'mma probably be old and saggy by then Hopefully that plastic

 You're 19 better looking in 10 years time at 29

(2:20:50) Yes 20 years time 39

 Uh yeah

 40 year or 30

(2:20:56) years time 49

 Uh yeah

 So better looking

(2:21:02) 49 than 19

 No Okay So in 10 years time you'll be

(2:21:10) better looking

 Yes

 20 years time better looking

 yes

 30 years time better looking i hope so But I don't know But compared

(2:21:17) to now at 19 um I mean to be honest I don't think so

(2:21:22) Better looking but I'll still feel good Like you know what I mean it's just like looking at like a young person and like

(2:21:28) an older person you know what I mean okay What about you

 according Oh me um

(2:21:33) no I think I'm probably at my peak right now Um but I'm going to make sure I stay attractive for my partner you know given

(2:21:41) the age range Okay So you're 27 Uh you're not going to

(2:21:46) be better looking at 37 is what you're saying

 don't think so

 Okay And are you better looking now or were you better

(2:21:51) looking at 18

 given that I had just left the UK with British teeth um definitely

(2:21:57) was not as good as now I fixed them Assuming you had your teeth fixed at 18

(2:22:02) would you have been better looking at 18 um probably Yeah cuz my teeth were horrendous

 Okay You're 29 better looking

(2:22:10) in 10 years time at 39

 um I don't know I don't really love the question Um it's a

(2:22:15) lot of agism but uh I do believe that for 39 or 49 or 59 I'm going to look as

(2:22:21) good as I possibly can at that age Will I look better than now i'm going to guess

 Wait how is it how is it agism

 to

(2:22:29) compare an older person to a younger person and suggest that being young is the ideal beauty That's agism

(2:22:36) How are you not familiar with the term explain it to me

 I just did but I can do it again

 Yeah do it again Agism is the

(2:22:43) idea that beauty is rooted in youth And so when somebody is being agist for

(2:22:49) example they'll say "Oh this person's too old That makes them ugly." Being um

() 

(2:22:54) older doesn't make someone ugly or less than So it's called uh agism You haven't

(2:23:00) heard this term i'm familiar with the term agism although the way you present it to me

(2:23:06) was not particular particularly convincing in terms of it that being a

(2:23:11) reflection of what agism is

 Oh there's no need to convince when I'm literally giving you a fact So

 so you think it's

(2:23:20) agist To think that younger people are more

(2:23:25) attractive What if

 No that's that is the that is the definition of agism is to

(2:23:30) suggest that youth is what makes someone beautiful

 Sure Do you think um when it

(2:23:36) comes to physical aesthetics do you think men or or women I'm not saying a sexual or romantic attraction I'm just

(2:23:43) talking about assessment of physical beauty Do you think men or women are more beautiful

(2:23:51) you're beautiful I promise

 Yeah Answer the question

 What's the question what is where with the question is the are men

(2:24:00) how is that not [ __ ] simple so it's like a um it's so

 do you think men or

(2:24:05) women are more beautiful

 oh so a facious argument Gotcha

 How is that facious

 what

(2:24:10) um what I'm saying is stop Wow Do you even know what that Do you know what

 yes I know exactly what it is

 Yeah How is it

(2:24:16) facious because you we were discussing a topic and instead of um debating me

(2:24:21) properly with that topic you chose a cherry-picking is what you did You chose a different

 Oh you mean a red herring

(2:24:28) it's not even a

 red herring No it's not I mean you could say it's a straw man but

 how is that a

 Explain what a straw

(2:24:35) man is

 oh my goodness So do you want the answer

 no Why don't you explain what a straw man is

 i don't feel like doing

 you don't know what a straw man is

 Because

(2:24:41) you're mad because you don't

 Because it's not a straw man It's not a straw man You don't know what aism is

 It would

(2:24:48) be prejudice towards someone ba on the basis of their age But now answer my question

 Prejudice is

(2:24:54) a I mean it could be that Yeah Um what was your question who's more beautiful

(2:25:00) women or men

 yeah Do you think men yeah Who do you think is more beautiful men or women

 i believe women are more beautiful

 Wow Congrats You're sexist

(2:25:06) towards men

 Yeah Well no I could have told you that What

 huh what okay You don't understand

(2:25:13) I said I'm sexist So you agree you agree with the logic then

 no I have which which logic of what sorry

 Well the logic

(2:25:19) would be you said that you think women are more beautiful than men Using your logical framework that would mean that

(2:25:26) because of your determination there that you're a sexist because because of you

(2:25:32) thinking women are more beautiful than men

 The discussion was agism So this

 but I'm I'm exploring the logic

 other

(2:25:39) questions that aren't the same as

 it Absolutely pertains to your logic

 Okay So if I believe that women are more

(2:25:45) beautiful than men then

 I wouldn't think that that makes you sexist

 I think

 I wouldn't think that that makes you a

(2:25:50) sexist

 You just said that that was sexist

 No under her Do you know what then okay

 You'd be smearing the

(2:25:57) conversation moving the goalpost a lot You got to keep up with what you talking about

 No you just don't understand

 You

(2:26:02) got to keep up with what you're talking about

 I'm sorry Go on

 Under your worldview it would be sexist using your

(2:26:08) sexist Um but those are your words It would Okay You're saying "Okay I'll

(2:26:14) explain it then."

 Calm down first Calm down

 Totally calm So

 I'm getting a

(2:26:19) little flustered Bunch your words

 Breathe

 So this is how

(2:26:25) I'd break it down You said "Well if you thought that say people who are between the age range of 20 or 30

 Mhm

 are more

(2:26:34) beautiful or more attractive than say people between the age range of 90 and 100."

 That's called preference

 No that's

(2:26:40) literally your argument No that's called preference Agism is the assumption that beauty is based on youth What I'm saying

(2:26:47) is that if I say "Oh I really think that 19 to 25 are the most attractive." That

(2:26:53) is preference There's a difference maker You understand

 beauty Hold on Beauty is based on many different things not just

(2:27:01) solely you

 Exactly So when you ask

 but there are traits that people possess in their youth that correspond with

(2:27:08) assessments of beauty

 based on society or based on your personal opinion

 Well

(2:27:13) so beauty is subjective

 Yes

 But it's there are partially objective

(2:27:20) measurements to beauty

 Right So partially objective measurements to beauty Beauty is subjective But what

(2:27:27) you're purely subjective

 it's not purely subjective Let's go with that What you're asking of us is to tell um tell

(2:27:33) you whether we were more beautiful when we were younger more beautiful now or more beautiful when we're older That is

(2:27:40) the idea Your question demands that we be agist

(2:27:46) How would that be agist to make an assessment of one's own attractiveness

(2:27:53) in contrast to how you looked when you were younger how you look now and how you think you'll look when you're older

(2:27:59) That wouldn't be agist

 Yes it is agist to say "Oh oh

 what if my position Wait

(2:28:05) question If my position is is that all of you will look more attractive when you're 90 does that still make me

(2:28:11) agist?"

 Preference What

 that's preference So what you're saying is preference but what I'm saying

(2:28:17) is that your question is geared towards asking us "Do you think you were

(2:28:22) prettier when you were younger?" leading up to possibly another ridiculous um question afterwards But answer question

(2:28:29) Yeah Let me let me test the logic here Okay

 Do you think it would be agist for me to say that 30 year olds are more

(2:28:36) intelligent than one-year-olds

 no

 Is that ages

 that's called opinion

 How is

(2:28:42) that no

 Unless you can site your sources Go for it Do you have the sources here

(2:28:47) on your computer

 wait hold on Do I do I need to site a study to look up to the

(2:28:53) sky and make a determination that the sky is blue

 if uh Yeah Yeah you probably

(2:28:58) do That's how we decided that the color was blue is by other people coming together and agreeing on a term It's

(2:29:04) called

 Okay Yeah You're trying to weasle something in there that wasn't even the actual claim M

 so you're talking about

(2:29:10) like language

 but you you agree that there's like wavelengths and these

(2:29:16) wavelengths manifest themselves in a certain way and that's color and like

(2:29:21) for example like uh in certain languages it's not the word blue it's a different

(2:29:26) word for blue I don't know do you how do you say blue in Spanish

 but I was going to say something else I was going to say

(2:29:32) that there's a field of science where you have to explain everything so what she's saying is just kind of like that like if there's like a thing where They

(2:29:39) have to say why this the sky is blue and all stuff You know what I mean like everything has a reason and an

(2:29:44) explanation

 Mhm Oh yeah The girl with glasses she probably needs somebody to explain it to her that it's blue She

(2:29:50) can't see it

 and you can't either Okay So just to be clear

(2:29:55) seven

 So is that the level of conversation that we're going to have though like every all the claims that I make I need to have a study for But

(2:30:02) you're able to forward claims without any studies You're the only one with a computer

 Or

 I'm just going off my off

(2:30:08) the dome

 Me too

 We're freestyling

 Yeah you were asking questions about how we

(2:30:13) would look as younger and as older That's where we was going with the conversation

 Do we need a study hold on Do we need a study to determine if Do

() 

(2:30:21) you think men are stronger than women hell yeah

 I mean that's an opinion Unless I know and have evidence to back

(2:30:26) it up

 Well there is there is evidence It is citing your sources But do you think me personally what is my opinion on

(2:30:33) whether men are stronger than you think yeah Do you think men are stronger than women

 yes I do I believe that men um

(2:30:39) generally uh size Yeah I think that men can be strong

 Are you sexist for thinking that

 i already told you I'm

(2:30:44) sexist against men sometimes

 Is that one of your sexist viewpoints

 no Why would that be one oh

 wait So are you are you

(2:30:51) actually sexist towards men

 a little bit sometimes Um how am I not you know I'm sorry What do

(2:30:58) you want to hear from me

 do you have a study on that

 trying to switch it up Yeah I have a study right here

 So do you consider yourself a misandress

 huh no I

(2:31:05) do not I do not consider myself a misandress but I mean

 Okay So why do you call yourself a sexist

 oh

(2:31:13) because I'm an honest person Sometimes you look at women I mean I've heard you say that um women are [ __ ] a million

(2:31:19) times When did I say that you You said this [ __ ] ditch this [ __ ] that [ __ ] throughout the Why would it be sexist to

(2:31:25) call a particular person who's acting [ __ ] why would that be sexist to call

(2:31:30) someone a [ __ ]

 i don't know But I think that call is in

 Huh

 i think it's in poor

(2:31:36) taste for how is it sexist to call a singular woman who is Have I called any of the women here at at the panel a

(2:31:43) [ __ ]

 i think you said it to her once earlier

 Yeah you did You're like this [ __ ]

 Yeah it was it was in conversation

(2:31:50) though It wasn't She said it and then you said it It wasn't a big deal

 Yeah she did Ryan

 did I it's possible I

(2:31:57) called you [ __ ]

 Yeah you said like wrong [ __ ] or something

 Maybe you're a little Hold on But we would have to

(2:32:02) rewind the tape Hold on Just throwing Do you think insulting somebody

(2:32:09) suggests that they're a sexist because you insulted them

(2:32:15) uh do I personally believe that that's what defines sexism uh no I think it can

(2:32:20) be

 So I like that you flipped it on me How are you a sexist

 how am I a Oh you saw that You caught that Okay keep up

(2:32:26) now Um so how am I a sexist well for example and let's keep it crude keep it simple Um if I see a man fall I'm going

(2:32:34) to laugh and I'm going to be like "Wow they're so stupid They do stupid things." Look at that one

 When people

(2:32:39) being dumb

 get hurt I think that that's funny

 Yeah It's called Shaden Freud

 It's

(2:32:44) called

 Yes

 Do you do that for women too or just for men

 uh just for men When a girl falls I'm like "Oh my god no." When

(2:32:50) men get cancer do you laugh at that

 no No not at all My father died of cancer and was a cancer researcher So no I

(2:32:56) don't find that funny I don't find actual threat to life funny I do find like little like if you tripped I would

(2:33:03) laugh I'm sorry I would laugh I would find it funny But that's

 But only men trip

 Yeah If a woman tripped I'd be like

(2:33:09) "Oh my gosh girl are you okay?"

 So women couldn't trip

 I laugh at anyone I I mean I don't know if it's

(2:33:16) objectionable Like sometimes people laugh when somebody like does a a gaff

(2:33:21) like they trip I

 Yeah it's a shame

 But if it's strictly towards men when they do it

 is that is

(2:33:29) that the best example of you being a sexist

 that's not the best example I don't think we have enough time for that

(2:33:34) We've got sexist I just I I don't know There's a lot of ways that I can feel

(2:33:40) sexist thoughts in my head and I don't have to share them with you now because

(2:33:45) I can't think of any right off the bat but as soon as I think of one I'll let you know Oh for example um you might say

(2:33:51) that calling a man an incel is uh sexist against men I would not I would say that there are lots of incelss You know you

(2:33:59) know what I mean

 wait but that doesn't make you sexist

 doesn't it that's what sexist men would I mean that's what men

(2:34:04) would say is sexist

 No that don't sound sexist It just sound like you hate men Mm- I don't There's a lot of men I like

(2:34:10) and respect I mean I And it's not

 What makes like a man sexist like

 what makes a man sexist um

 hide this

 Yeah

 Yeah

(2:34:20) Thank you

 I don't know Uh I can't think of any off top I don't feel I'm sorry

(2:34:25) I'm tired Um what makes a man sexist against women uh expectations that them

(2:34:31) being um an Only Fans model at 19 or 20 means that they're promiscuous and that

(2:34:36) they're not actually a virgin Assuming that while assuming another woman is actually a virgin based on her religion

(2:34:42) when you don't know the religion of the first one Calling a woman um basically uh sled shaming or scarlet lettering

(2:34:48) essentially I think that's sexist Yeah So like

 why why would it be sexist to assume that somebody who's involved in

(2:34:55) sex work and there's massive amounts of evidence pointing towards only Hold on

(2:35:01) You got to stop Stop I let you talk

 I'm sorry

 Wait hold on Can Can we get the cameras going please um

 what is that

(2:35:09) okay So sorry

(2:35:15) How would pointing out that a woman who's involved in Only Fans and having

(2:35:21) questions as to the validity of her being a virgin why would that point towards sexism and

(2:35:27) not just their relation to an industry which is built on like deception fraud

(2:35:33) and lying

 there's many facets to that industry and that what you're saying I understand those parts of your point but

(2:35:40) I do feel like assuming someone's promiscuity based on them being a woman and you know being in an industry that

(2:35:47) you maybe don't agree with but assuming anything without proof or evidence you're saying that you think this person

(2:35:54) is a liar I don't feel I feel like that's sexist I think that a lot of men do it They do it very often They'll be

(2:36:00) like "Oh she does this She must be this kind of a woman She must be you know or oh look at the way she dresses that

(2:36:06) means she's sleeping around or look at the way she's flirt flirting with people that means she's this that's a that's

(2:36:13) men are men do a lot

 I think those terms get thrown around too loosely now if a

(2:36:18) woman is showing her ass and titties it's only right for a man to think that she got peaches for sale I was always

(2:36:25) told if you don't got peaches for sale take that sign out but if you do got that sign up you cannot be offended when

(2:36:30) you get the attention that your body gets you

 going to have to bridge how

(2:36:36) thinking someone is a liar equates to that being sexism because the individual

(2:36:42) who you think is a liar is a woman

 Just because you accuse a particular woman of

(2:36:48) potentially lying that doesn't you're going to have to gap the bridge to how that becomes sexism

(2:36:55) Um I I'm gapping the bridge between how women being Okay Yeah So yeah it's just

(2:37:02) sexist to assume Assumptions are like [ __ ] We all know the saying Um making

 the assumption is based on her

(2:37:08) being a sex worker not her being a woman No it's still she's still a woman Yes

(2:37:15) Wait so if a bad woman also but you assume that she's not doing she's lying

(2:37:20) but she's not That's that's confusing for me

 If a bad thing if a bad thing happens to a woman it must be sexism

 No

(2:37:27) I don't think a bad thing happening to a woman is always sexism But I do think that if you

(2:37:34) if you treat women that way and you believe that they're less than because of the industry that they work in then I

(2:37:40) do feel like

 why would that be wrong

 i feel like it's a bit sexist I mean you're consuming it are you

 what if what

(2:37:46) if I were to say it's actually not about gender and I h I hold these same criticisms towards men

(2:37:53) in that exact same field

 That's interesting How many of those men have you had on your show how would that be

(2:38:00) evidence of me holding a different position

 i just It's interesting

 Okay

(2:38:05) cool Well wait hold on So because I've never had Actually wait We have Hold on

(2:38:10) We have had if I recall correctly Hold on

(2:38:15) Sure I But I'll grant that Yeah we have more women only fans creators than we've had like men

 How would that point

(2:38:21) towards anything

 i don't know I'm just asking

(2:38:27) But um did you want a red question about the so it's just a red herring then sorry I got bored with this conversation

(2:38:32) I'm so sorry Um the age question though yes it is it is asking us to be agist

(2:38:38) against our younger or against our older self So that's just my perspective

 Okay Going back to my other question going

(2:38:43) back to my other question Why would it be agist to say that 30

() 

(2:38:50) year olds are more intelligent than one-year-olds no That would be why why that

(2:38:58) 30-year-olds are more intelligent than one-year-olds no it would not be

 You're saying something positive about somebody

(2:39:04) of a certain age in contrast to somebody of a different age

 You can look up the definition

 But so why why would it be

(2:39:12) not agist to say I think this age group is more intelligent but then it is agist

(2:39:18) to say I think this age group is more beautiful or does your has your logic just

(2:39:23) completely crumbled under my scrutiny

 no So by that merit what you're suggesting is that saying a 30-year-old is more

(2:39:30) intelligent than a one-year-old So yes your question was geared at asking us to establish like to estimate ourselves as

(2:39:37) more beautiful at a young age and uglier at an older age Your question I mean that literally is the point of the

(2:39:43) question was it not like it is I mean you're asking me oh is it ages to do this this and this but yes your question

(2:39:50) was geared towards having us say that we're when we're older we're not attractive

(2:39:55) Hold on You can respond to the question in any way you want I'm just again trying to explore the logic on this

(2:40:01) You're saying

 you're saying you think it's agist for somebody to say that people say between the age of 20 and 40

(2:40:09) are more physically attractive than people between the ages of 80 and 100 And you think that that's agist But then

(2:40:15) when I ask you well do you think that 30 year olds are more intelligent than one-year-olds

(2:40:22) that's not agist

 I think one is one is based on your own opinion and one is

(2:40:27) based on scientific facts No it's all like beauty I mean there like for beauty

(2:40:33) you have different things like science like I think beauty is defined in many different ways and across cultures and

(2:40:40) then so you can't just fit like I don't know you just I think that's more

(2:40:45) opinion but like if you're asking if like a one-year-old is smarter than a 30-year-old no that's like brain

(2:40:50) development

 and it also depends on the person I don't know

 well but then there would be we could okay so you're talking

(2:40:57) about there's the the actual structure of the brain like you know like

 okay but then what about the structure of the

(2:41:02) skin

 right so structurally but what makes what makes what is beauty and like

(2:41:08) structurally if you go to different you know cultures you know there's different

(2:41:14) standards for beauty you know

 well I mean even across cultures there are

(2:41:20) there are certain things across cultures that are um

 similar

(2:41:28) that are preferred Right

 Uh so I mean yeah there's like different beauty

(2:41:33) standards in Asia or in Africa or in the West Europe whatever

 Yeah

 But I'm pretty

(2:41:41) confident to say that I could show like I could show anybody in the world

 Uh is

(2:41:46) it logically possible that the following could be true you have a really beautiful person like

(2:41:52) someone you think is really beautiful and then you have a photo of like a really really ugly person really ugly

(2:41:58) person And we showed these two photos to every single person in the world

(2:42:04) And I think it if people were being honest I think with 99.99%

(2:42:10) certainty most people would pick if we were asking them to assess the beauty

(2:42:16) they would pick the one that's how we would deem as beautiful

 Right

 so the

(2:42:21) idea that there's while it's not objective it would be universal that

(2:42:26) does point to there being some objective components to beauty I think beauty is

(2:42:32) subjective

 but it's not purely subjective

 But like brain development isn't subjective That's not

 well like

(2:42:39) you could argue that IQ tests are a social uh what's it called social

 whatever it's

(2:42:47) called construct Social construct There's facts and there's opinions A 30-year-old is smarter than a

(2:42:52) one-year-old That's simple

 Mhm Okay But if like but if I were to show a picture

(2:42:58) of 20-year-old Megan Fox and then 100year-old

(2:43:04) George Washington I don't know [ __ ] George Washington's pretty hot

 Yeah he is pretty hot That is fair

(2:43:11) I I like him

 [ __ ] up by picking George Washington here

 Just stay with Megan Fox

(2:43:16) I You know maybe I should pick a woman Uh [ __ ]

 Madonna Pick Madonna She

(2:43:21) Jennifer Anderson Deborah Burke she's hot too

 Betty White

(2:43:27) was really hot when she was young

 Helen what she did

 i mean she [ __ ]

(2:43:34) Wait do you remember that i don't know if you were

 about Nancy Reagan photo It's like a white girl with

 you know

(2:43:42) that photo Never mind

 I don't know

 Draw it for us

 I gota I'm gonna try to find it I'm gonna try to find it

 You're

(2:43:49) talking about like a hot girl

 Yeah but we're I'm gonna move it on but I'm gonna try to find it Um will you be better looking in 10 years time your 20

 I think

(2:43:56) I'm going to look exactly the same

 in 10 years time

 Probably

 20 years time at 49

(2:44:01) Probably still better looking Still the same Okay Still the same

 30 years time 59

 I will still look like this until I'm

(2:44:08) 79 And then I will just look like a rotten avocado and you'll have to throw

(2:44:14) me away

 Oh okay Hold on I found it Uh hold on Ah [ __ ] What did I do god damn

(2:44:19) it

 No no no no no Ah [ __ ] I opened up in [ __ ] paint What the [ __ ] uh and then

(2:44:25) you're 29 Were you better looking at 19 um

 or better looking now or the same

 ooh

(2:44:31) I think I peaked out at like 31

(2:44:37) So

 31 was the peak

 yeah And then now it's just kind of settling in the dust

(2:44:43) and I'm just riding the wave I'm all right with it

(2:44:50) All right Uh and wait so do we just keep going up do we just keep going up like 59 69

 i'm gonna look like this till like

(2:44:57) I'm almost maybe like 70s 80s and then Yeah and then I'll look dead

(2:45:04) I like I said I'll be a shrunken avocado It's like an avocado you know you put them on the on the counter and you're like "Oh it's not ready yet It's not

(2:45:10) ready It's not ready." And then like you go the next morning and then it's all shriveled up and wrinkled and you're like "I got to throw it away now."

(2:45:17) That's me basically I'm just going to be dead one day Okay Um what about you

 i'm circling the drain Asking me if I'm

(2:45:23) going to be better

 But will you be 10 years time better looking or the same worst worse looking

 And then 57 Let's go back

(2:45:29) in time Better looking at 47

 Uh no I was not better looking at 47

 Better looking

(2:45:35) now

 I'm better looking now than I was at 47

 37

 I was way better looking at

 Better 37 I peaked That was my peak

 And then 27

(2:45:43) Were you better looking at 27 or

 better looking at 37 than 27 but better looking at 27 than 57

(2:45:52) you know Well yeah because of the young factor

(2:45:58) The young factor

 Yeah As opposed to the old factor

 And then 27 versus 47

 Uh 47

(2:46:06) was not good Yeah 27

 37 better than 27 37 was good Yeah

 All right And then

(2:46:12) you're 24 better looking in 10 years time at 34

 no

 Okay Makes it simple Uh so

(2:46:17) here's the Do you have the photo

 it's not in like the weird Oh wait wait wait Get it out of that

 Can you try to like

(2:46:24) drag it like

 You can probably save it Do you know what I'm talking about

 get out

(2:46:29) of the Dropbox ecosystem

 You got it

 Yeah All right So

(2:46:37) I'm fairly confident that I could show this image

(2:46:43) to the entire world And I think they picked the girl on the

() 

(2:46:50) left as more attractive really

(2:46:57) And so I this would point to again beauty is subjective but not purely

(2:47:04) subjective

 because there would be universality in people picking the woman on the left

(2:47:11) versus the woman on the right It's possible some somebody might pick

(2:47:16) the you know the woman on the right I'm not going to say it's 100% everybody in the world would pick the woman on the

(2:47:23) left but

(2:47:28) I don't know Is does anybody disagree

 i I I don't see the problem with the woman

(2:47:34) on the right

 I

 Is the woman Is the person on the right a woman

 okay she was

(2:47:39) ugly as [ __ ] That girl on the left was way better Her body was nicer and her face and she was younger looking so we

(2:47:45) could be honest

 Oh younger looking

 But she's somebody's type

 She was younger Like the other lady is somebody's type

(2:47:50) Somebody's going to find her like a 10 out of 10

 Yeah

 Well

 the other woman I I

(2:47:55) don't know Maybe

 statistically they're going to pick the one on the left

 right but we're not scientists

 All it is

(2:48:02) beauty in the beauty eyes of the beholder [ __ ] That should be wrong as [ __ ] That [ __ ] was bad The one on the

(2:48:08) right was ugly Can

 pull it up again maybe real quick Yeah she cute

 Yeah By the way like we

(2:48:14) were talking about like cultural differences and I agree there are cultural differences like in Asia or in

(2:48:19) Europe or in Latin America whatever it is But like certain traits like symmetry

(2:48:26) health indicators proportionality they're consistently preferred

 Yeah Cuz even in Latin America the lighter you

(2:48:32) are the more better looking you are So that woman across cultures uh larger

(2:48:38) lips

 like full full lips

 across cultures is deemed as more

 in Asia in in No you

(2:48:47) disagree

 Is deemed as what

 korea No

 in Korea

 I mean I don't speak for them but apparently no

 big lips Yeah like

 in

(2:48:54) Korea you want in you want small thin well But I'm pretty sure even lips

(2:49:01) in Korea

 Okay let's say the the black girl she dressed up with like the same outfit as the other one and she did her

(2:49:08) hair like the lighting really didn't hit her face Can you even see like half of her face and she has a nice smile She's not ugly Like I feel like we're judging

(2:49:14) her

 based of like what other people I don't know

 Yo get this girl some glasses

(2:49:20) prescription or something Bro you got to get linked up with Seven You got

 I'm I also think like we were

(2:49:27) kind of

 Wait hold that Pull it Wait

 hold on Wait Hold on The outfit is the problem

 a

(2:49:34) little bit Like I feel like

 I think that outfit looks good on her That That's more flattering than what if she was

(2:49:40) going to wear on the lighting

 You can even see half of her face

 Can we zoom in like look at it

 Yeah we can zoom in

 Well

(2:49:47) the sun is angled on the left so it is shadowing

 You know what yeah let's be charitable The the the lighting is way

(2:49:53) The way you're judging this person is the way you judge yourself So

 exactly the same I agree

(2:50:00) She's beautiful

 Do you think there's anything we can know with common sense not having to just prove it like you

(2:50:06) don't have to go and everyone knows like the sky is blue You don't have to check someone's parts to know for the most

(2:50:13) part that they're a woman when you see them Like that's just common sense There are things we should just be able to look at that picture and not to degrade

(2:50:20) the woman on the right but just objectively yes she is less attractive I don't understand why we have to like

(2:50:25) prove all these things with science and statistics Like you can still come to knowledge with just common sense that

(2:50:31) things we all just know to be true

 But common sense isn't common anymore That's the problem

 She might be attractive to

(2:50:38) people where she lives because if she wasn't then there wouldn't be a million other people who look like her So beauty

(2:50:44) is subjective We're looking at it through a western lens We are seeing a Caucasian woman and a dark-kinned

(2:50:51) Aboriginal woman and we're judging them based on that Um I

 think if you go back if you go back to like kind of what I

(2:50:57) was

 Felicity I'm I'm just saying that like what I wanted to say is that I

(2:51:03) think like ideally across cultures like what you what defines beauty and what makes that it's like attraction of a man

(2:51:10) to a woman

 and for what for mating

 and when is a woman in her prime she's young

(2:51:17) she you know is probably in her 20s 30s whatever right like that there's certain

(2:51:23) features that can make that attractive

(2:51:33) overall in culture across the board in the world Yes there are outliers and she

(2:51:40) could be like the best mom or whatever and that could make her 10 out of 10 or to her husband Um so I just am saying

(2:51:47) that there's differences but I at the end of the day it's also goes back to what is the physical attraction for and

(2:51:55) I think it is just like basically saying that like you like women in their prime

(2:52:00) which is like their time to have babies is like what I think beauty kind of was built around

 Well and also like think

(2:52:06) about art like compare the Notream Cathedral to like a hut on the side of the road What which one is more

(2:52:13) beautiful like objectively there is an answer We all know it to be true Don't

(2:52:18) you don't have to have a scientific study to say that a Gothic cathedral is more beautiful than like a mood

 Okay I

(2:52:24) get your point But there's a Gothic cathedral versus like minimalist uh architecture You you're

(2:52:32) comparing apples to oranges If you want to compare two things of beauty let's take the Sistine Chapel and then take

(2:52:38) the other one That is a comparison of two art two pieces of art Well you just

(2:52:43) picked two beautiful things like each other

 But they're differently beautiful are they not i mean you're saying they

(2:52:48) look exactly the same

 No they don't But those can both be beautiful

 right so mud

() 

(2:52:55) That's our point Um we try too hard to be woke It's either ugly or pretty That's just Yeah that's simple Because

(2:53:02) you can't base somebody looks off of because of the lighting and this and that bro It's in your face

(2:53:09) You just become more less

 Exactly And that's that's normal for women You know we age We age out So that's why take

(2:53:17) care of yourself while you can

 I mean look at Salah for example She's beautiful

 But she's still age so it's

(2:53:22) obvious She looked good for her age but she don't look like no 20-year-old no more And that's okay That is okay If

(2:53:28) she's a old woman who still looks good that's what matters But that lady was old and she was not attractive We don't

(2:53:34) got to you know break it down The lighting and this and that Like it's simple She was not attractive The one on

(2:53:40) the left was It don't got to be this woke pra whatever the hell Luke is talking about

 Oh it's that Lucas guy

(2:53:46) again It's a Lucas guy that you like his face

 Woke pra

 Yeah

 The one where you said he's ugly

 Let's dispense the woke

(2:53:52) paddle Correct Oh my gosh

 Okay guys Can I speak architecture yes

 Yeah please do

 I was

(2:53:58) going to say that like imagine looking more like the the one on the right and then now you're saying "Oh that lady is

(2:54:04) ugly." Like you know what I mean so many people look more like her Like a lot of us don't look like the beauty center and we are constantly chasing something that

(2:54:10) is not even real People are getting like things done to look more attractive But like who cares like everybody's pretty

(2:54:17) Like you guys are all pretty and the two girls are pretty by like their own thing You know what I mean it's not about being bold It's about like why are you

(2:54:23) judging them and you're also judging yourself because you guys give yourself like your own rating right

 i believe

(2:54:29) that everybody is you know how they look It's pretty people and it's ugly people But it's all about your confidence

(2:54:34) That's what matters the most because when you're confident can't nobody tell you nothing So rock that [ __ ]

 Well and there's it's not saying that they're not

(2:54:40) valuable as humans to point out that they're less objectively attractive And that's okay And like I think one of the

(2:54:46) comments too about like beauty being objective like there's this not to get too like philosophical but like Greek

(2:54:52) thought of truth goodness and beauty are these transcendental truths that they just are They're objective Truth

(2:54:58) goodness and beauty For most of human history that was an understanding And only in the past couple I don't know

(2:55:04) decades hundred years are we like okay now you have to prove everything that this is less beautiful Everyone knows

(2:55:10) like the Mona Lisa is more beautiful than like what a 2-year-old draws It can

(2:55:15) be you can still find it to be like cute and beautiful in a certain way but one is clearly objectively less beautiful

 I

(2:55:23) agree Cuz if we boil it down to basic human nature you know let's take away

(2:55:28) modern all this modern [ __ ] People in the wilderness you wanted to procreate with the finest piece of specimen to

(2:55:34) create another fine piece of specimen That's just natural That's just human nature because you wouldn't want to

(2:55:40) recreate with somebody that is you know mentally [ __ ] You don't want to do that because what does that mean for

(2:55:46) your own you know line or your own jeans correct You want to create something

(2:55:51) that is beautiful and you're not going to go for something that is ugly if you want to create something that is beautiful That's just humans

 Okay First

(2:55:57) of all the beauty center has changed so much over time Like if you look up like I don't know a thousand years ago what was the beauty center like I don't want

(2:56:03) to speak like factually cuz I don't know [ __ ] But like I'm saying like it used to be like people that were ugly and big

(2:56:09) used to be considered more attractive because it meant that they have food at home or whatever you know like they were healthier I don't even know But you know

(2:56:14) what I'm saying

 yeah Mhm

 There's certainly like levels of culture that change niches or like specific parts of

(2:56:21) preferences

 but in general I think most of us can look at something and just say which one is objectively prettier more

(2:56:26) beautiful

 Correct You don't got to get into deep semantics about it

 I don't think it's woke to say I don't I don't

(2:56:32) think that it's woke for a person to say "Hey there's two women I don't I'm not going to compare two women to each

(2:56:38) other." I don't feel like it's um I think it's in bad taste to compare people especially other women for me to

(2:56:44) sit here and say that one's prettier than that one What if either one of them was watching it right now and they were hurt by this i'm not going to compare

(2:56:50) women to one another But if you want to I understand that I just feel like it might go against your um religious

(2:56:56) statements that you've made

 Like my beauty listen

 no need to go for her religious statements because she's backing up her claims If somebody is

() 

(2:57:04) less attractive what do you what do you think woke

 two individuals there I'm speaking just in general about beauty

(2:57:09) being an objective thing And this is not about judging someone's worth Everyone is made in the image of God And your

(2:57:15) beauty doesn't define your value

 We all just sat here and said that we were going to decide who the entire world

(2:57:22) would deem more

 Correct And that's all we talked about It was the most basic question Who looked better that was simple It was

(2:57:28) a simple question And you being woke by you know lengthening the conversation by explaining beauty is in the eye of the

(2:57:35) beholder [ __ ] that lady was unattractive It's that simple You don't got to complicate it

 Yeah Okay Now there we go

(2:57:43) with the semantics Like she was unattractive

 You actually think pretty Megan Fox

 huh

 you actually think you're

(2:57:49) a pretty ass Megan Fox

 Oh yeah You believe that and that's you I trust you Like I was saying yeah like I put my

(2:57:54) hand up I feel like I was one of the two people that did

 Okay

 But that's your opinion And I like

 it's not an opinion

(2:58:00) when it's right in your face You know y'all got to stop trying to confuse or misconrue opinion with facts That lady

(2:58:06) was unattractive It's that simple You don't got to be so you know uh heartfelt

(2:58:11) with it or you know what do you call it um apologetic Stop the apologetic [ __ ]

(2:58:17) that you don't

 I think it's fair to say that I won't compare two women to each other And I don't think it's my place to

(2:58:22) decide what the world thinks is beautiful Maybe I think differently than other people do Yes we discussed um

(2:58:28) agism and we've discussed like older people being less attractive Then there wouldn't be granny porn would there okay

(2:58:34) So there's people out there who like different strokes for different folks Some like Pepsi and some like Coke Hey

(2:58:39) now

 Yeah Exactly So I mean there's it's just a difference a difference of opinion Not Not truly a fact No

 it's But

(2:58:45) that's not opinion though It's just a fact Like when you're less attractive you're ugly That's simple But it's funny

(2:58:51) that you're having this opinion and I'm thinking back to the beginning of the show when he Brian asks us our ages and

(2:58:57) then it's you know there's opinions and facts and it's like if you don't want to say

(2:59:02) your age that's

 Oh that's smearing the conversation because I told him a fact My age

 right

 i'm just saying it's just

(2:59:09) funny hearing these opinions coming from you

(2:59:14) But I'm not talking about opinions I'm talking about

 them coming from Brian

 But I told him a fact What what does

(2:59:20) anything have to do with my opinion that was a fact So what are we talking

(2:59:25) about

 nothing

 Cuz we can't misconrue the conversation

 No I'm not mis

 I didn't say my age but that's not an opinion That

(2:59:33) was a fact And I told him my age which was a fact

 right

(2:59:40) keep going

 I don't know

 It's okay So are we smearing the conversation or

(2:59:46) are we staying on point cuz we was talking about basic [ __ ]

 Hey keep keep going

 It's just

(2:59:55) I know it's confusing with all of us sitting here I'm just I just it's just it's just it

(3:00:00) just come don't take this wrong way but uh cuz we all friends before this I guess but um I I just it's ironic

(3:00:08) sitting here and like hearing like Brian talking to you about simple questions

(3:00:15) that are facts and then and then hearing you run around the circle with it and

(3:00:20) then now we're talking about something and you're saying it was just a fact

(3:00:26) It's just and so it's just interesting that we heard from Brian earlier about like it was literally just like whatever

(3:00:32) he was telling you earlier was like what you're saying now

 and about and so it's like I just am confused why it was

(3:00:39) confusing for you earlier

 Okay So when I told Brian my actual age was that an opinion or was it a fact

(3:00:46) i'm hoping it was a fact

 You're hoping it was a fact or do you want to know that it was a fact or it was an opinion

(3:00:51) or you just not trying to admit that it was an actual fact when I said it

(3:00:56) i'm just I I am just saying I'm not

 All you got to do is answer the question It's a simple question Was it a fact or

(3:01:01) was it opinion when I told him my age i'm assuming you told him the truth So it's a fact

 Thank you

 I don't need a

(3:01:08) driver's license

 That's it I'm talking about facts I'm not talking about opinions

 So if you're right so it's just

(3:01:13) No I'm with you That makes sense what you're saying I get you

 No women Y'all are smearing the conversation We not

(3:01:19) staying on point What we were talking about was the basic level of

(3:01:24) attractiveness or not All of this well if the lighting was good if she did lose

(3:01:29) weight if her hair was tied up if she had on a different top No nobody asked all that It was a simple question

(3:01:38) What's the question

 i mean we all everyone every single one of us when we walked in we all judged each other

(3:01:44) whether it was good or bad It isn't Like y'all didn't mind calling me pretty but y'all mind calling somebody ugly why is

(3:01:50) that

 because it makes them feel bad

 Okay It makes it makes ourselves feel bad Does it make them feel bad or is it just

(3:01:56) the truth and you know sometimes people can't handle the truth about things that I say I know what I feel and I say what

(3:02:02) I feel So me saying that I won't compare those two women is simply based on my

(3:02:07) character That's a thing

 It has nothing to do with your character If you call somebody unattractive

 that's part of how

(3:02:12) I view this world And I don't want to compare two women Yes I'll judge myself all day long But I'm not about to judge

(3:02:18) other women for what what does it get me i gain nothing out of it I think it just

(3:02:24) I don't know I think we were just objectively talking about beauty and that's why it came up I don't think any of us would be sitting here judging

(3:02:31) that picture if we weren't if it wasn't brought up in conversation

 right yeah

 So

(3:02:37) well did you observe anyone's features when you walked in like anyone's outfits or whatever that's judgment

 That's

(3:02:44) natural for girls We always sizing each other up and looking each other and looking for

 We don't dress for men We

(3:02:49) dress for other women

 I dress for men I don't know about y'all but I dress for men and women

 Yeah

(3:02:56) Right

 Okay Um

 Well I think the point you're making is probably like we all

(3:03:01) make judgments

 correct

 everyone does Like you can't escape You can't have a world in which we don't make judgments

(3:03:07) And so yes you can be charitable in those and try to treat everyone with respect but it doesn't mean that we're

(3:03:13) not judging them And that's not inherently bad

 How I judge them is important though

(3:03:19) So I could judge somebody in my head but I don't say it out loud because it would be hurtful to them and not because I

(3:03:25) want to you know be gentle or easy just because I choose not to emotionally

(3:03:30) devastate someone else

 I also feel like we can see who is really beauty like sorry beautiful inside and outside from

(3:03:36) the way they speak about other people Yeah that's a judgment

 Yeah

 that's an

(3:03:42) opinion But is it a fact my

(3:03:48) We're never going to know what a fact is We're never going to know

 Is there Is there um proof on that can you pull it

(3:03:54) up there's a case study we can read about Yeah

(3:04:00) Yeah I mean I'm sure we all have thought different things about each other based on our looks and what we've all said

 I

(3:04:05) don't think there's anything wrong with that

 I don't I don't think that somebody telling the truth it makes them ugly on

(3:04:11) the inside In fact it makes them a bold person because what people do is lie You sit here and say "You don't judge

(3:04:17) women." But you know if I was ugly you wouldn't have called me pretty And that would have been you judging me in the

(3:04:23) first place If I didn't look like a certain way you would have been judging me in your head So just because you don't say it out loud doesn't make it

(3:04:29) not true Doesn't make it not real I'm just saying what needs to be said

 Not said out loud

 But that's not that's not

(3:04:35) what I'm saying

 I I don't think it makes you more bold to be honest I mean brashness never makes it

 Yeah it does

(3:04:41) Cuz people people often overlook the truth And what y'all sitting here doing is talking about some Well she would be

(3:04:47) pretty if this if that if this if that So nobody's saying nothing now

 I never said that I said I wouldn't get How do

(3:04:53) you really feel Jade

 Tell us how you really feel Jade

 how it is talking to women and they don't give you a specific answer They like to talk in

(3:05:10) circles and smear the conversation and move the goalpost I think she's very specific

 Yeah she was

(3:05:17) I agreed with her

 Libby Right

 Yes

 Yeah Thanks

 Well we got Lucas here Let's dispense with the woke paddle Beauty is

(3:05:24) mostly objective with some variability across cultures It is determined by symmetry and ratio For example the

(3:05:36) fertility Well put Lucas Well put Thank you Lucas Thank you for the super chat

 Uh Jade

(3:12:52) Okay you have a business degree Uh relig You got a in religious studies and philosophy

 Yeah

 Uh we did the British

(3:13:00) memes for No plastic surgery

 No

 Okay Oh you did a

(3:13:06) video We're not going to pull it up but you did a video You called that Bonnie Blue the woman who slept with like a I

(3:13:11) don't even know I think it's

 57

 I don't think she actually did it

 in one day

 I I

(3:13:17) don't think she actually did this [ __ ] though

 She said she did it in 12 hours and they had like about what was it 20

(3:13:22) seconds each

 Mathematically maybe

 But I think they just claim [ __ ]

 right

(3:13:29) marketing strategy

 And then they don't even have to do the thing that's bad They can just say they did it and it'll

(3:13:36) still get the traction

 Like they play the tip

 She pretend one of these girls I don't know if it was Bonnie Blue or it

(3:13:42) was uh we had her on the show Lily Phillips who did the same kind of stunt She pretended to be pregnant

 Yeah

 She

(3:13:49) like had a little fake baby bump

 and she's like "I got pregnant but" And it's like a lot of them a lot of these OF

() 

(3:13:55) girls they're just lying about some of this stuff

 like cuz it to to get

(3:14:00) traction It's a It's a

 That's a terrible example for young women but Okay

 Yeah Um

(3:14:07) but uh you you said something that deeply offended me

 Okay

 You

(3:14:13) said that her vagina looks like Arby's

 I googled it though It kind of does

 Wait

(3:14:18) You've seen that

 i did

 You looked Wait hold on

 Like Arby's

 Jade you looked at

(3:14:23) her vagina

 It's on Twitter

 I did I had to

 Oh

 you had to show what type of time

(3:14:30) you had Well I was looking for the video to see if she had slept with that many people and I found a lot of the like can

(3:14:36) I say gang bangs bangs

 Sure

 And um yeah I mean you see the guys pulling out and

(3:14:42) it's like you know it's coming out You know what I mean

 i don't know what you mean cuz I haven't seen her vagina But

(3:14:48) would you like to

 but I don't think her her vagina is not like that because

(3:14:53) she's allegedly [ __ ]

 Correct If you actually educated yourself on sex the size of a woman's labia does not mean

(3:15:00) she has had a ton of bodies

 A woman who's a virgin

 minor around the entrance though it was very much like coming Yeah

(3:15:06) that doesn't mean that she has been sexually active all the time Every time

(3:15:12) sex education

 a woman who's a virgin

 why you even checking for a woman's vagina count anyway you had that much time to

(3:15:19) pull up her picture

 penis count

 Well penis count Yes I wanted to see what was going on down there because if you sleep

(3:15:25) with that many people in one day you're probably going to get sore Things are going to be swollen

 Well most sexual

(3:15:32) people educate themselves So I'm pretty sure if she's sexually active like that she's not just doing it raw or anything

(3:15:38) like that So that just shows what type of time you had as a woman looking up another one

 I'm not educated Got it I

(3:15:44) think

 I said educated on the sexual matter

 I went to Cambridge and Oxford Um

(3:15:52) but I mean she's being a little sassy towards you but but a woman could be a virgin and

(3:15:59) she could have like

 Mhm

 large labia She could have as you as you characterized it some Arby's right

 and a woman could

(3:16:06) have slept with a thousand dudes and have just like a little slit

 Oh for sure You know

(3:16:13) there's a you know big labia matter Big labas matter Big Leia Mater

(3:16:20) Maiders supporter I find this offensive

 Okay

 I

(3:16:25) find it offensive that you're referring to women's vaginas at RB sandwiches

 Okay Now you sound like Waco Texas

 Would like

(3:16:32) an apology immediately on behalf I'm the representative of women with large

(3:16:38) vagina ladies Excuse me Not the vaginas Mhm

 Sorry I offended you but that's on

(3:16:44) you I was just

 No excuse me I want

 Okay A proper British apology

 A proper one

(3:16:53) Okay Like how Bonnie Blue apologizes to people

 Looks like you're in a bit of a pickle

 In a pickle

 Bit of a pickle Love

(3:17:01) No I mean if people want to get offended that's fine If you have the labia minora or majora further up around your [ __ ]

(3:17:07) and all that area that's fine That's natural You're born with it But if you're going to sleep around with that many men you're probably going to get a

(3:17:14) lot looser down there There is no such thing as a vagina That is the childish

(3:17:20) [ __ ] I've ever heard Cheddar

(3:17:26) looks like cheddar down there Can't have that And some toast

(3:17:33) There it is There it is

 Keep going Keep going That's it That's all you got

(3:17:40) She's so good I need that like on my like Halloween

(3:17:47) like a good cackle I love it

 You won't get any trick-or-treaters

(3:17:52) I'm just saying you know look if the woman she's got an Audi she's got a large labia We shouldn't shame people We

(3:17:58) shouldn't genitalia shame people you know for how they're born

 I was just making fun of Bonnie in particular

(3:18:03) Bonnie

 Bonnie in particular

 because I feel like she's very dangerous for young women

 Well if you can make fun of Bonnie

(3:18:09) you can make fun of women like her So there are a lot of women like her

 I'm just saying there's maybe you know as a

(3:18:15) representative of uh I'm an ally of women with large labas

 Mhm

 We don't

(3:18:21) appreciate that kind of language

 Okay

 In our community

 Okay

 Yeah

 Well I'm sorry

(3:18:27) that offends you

 Well that's a typical narcissistic apology I'm sorry you were offended

 Okay I want you to take

(3:18:34) responsibility for the deeply hurtful words that you directed at the women I advocate for

 You know

(3:18:41) everyone should get offended over something

 I'm deeply offended

 I'm hurt

(3:18:47) I'm hurt

 You've just by you saying that there was some woman who was following

(3:18:52) you who loved your based political takes but she had a giant labia and now

(3:18:58) because of that she just went and got a labia plasty There's 10,000 by the way in the United States every year It's a

(3:19:03) very sad thing Very tragedy I'm If I became president

 ban it

 It's banned

 It

(3:19:10) can't happen See she approves of my advocacy

(3:19:15) Matter Well here's the thing All labia matter but all labia can't matter until big

(3:19:22) labia matter

 Correct

 See what's up

 Okay See see we on the same page now She's my

(3:19:29) girl She's my home girl now I thought you were my Caucasian but now I got to

(3:19:35) switch it up Now she's the homie

 Now she's the

 You did say your wives was black so you should have been on my side

(3:19:41) from the jump Anyways

 Mhm

 Okay

 I'm just saying you

(3:19:47) know show Put a little respect Put a little respect

 I can't respect Bonnie Blue and what she

 No not Bonnie Blue

(3:19:52) Yeah that she's a degen She's a degenerate

 But there's way more other ways to uh attack her You know what I

(3:19:58) mean

 it's just a common thing people have said and it's

 funny

 Yeah But you know in the same way like the small dick

(3:20:04) energy thing we got to get rid of that Small dick energy

 Small dick energy We can't be shaming We can't be shaming men

(3:20:10) or women for their genitalia cuz men can't change their penis size Women can't change their labia size

 So I

(3:20:16) should sense it myself

 No you just I'm saying you shouldn't be you know non

(3:20:23) immutable characteristics should be off limits

 Okay I was making a very specific

(3:20:28) joke about Bonnie because I don't like what she's doing especially to young women

 Anyways moving on

 Are you a model

(3:20:37) or a supermodel

 sorry

 Sorry Can you repeat that i didn't hear you Absolutely Are you a s a model okay

(3:20:45) never mind Are you a model or a supermodel

 i'm not a supermodel

 What's the difference between a model and a

(3:20:52) supermodel um I think a supermodel is um a model who who's got lots of covers and

(3:20:58) she's worked in multiple different countries um has a very high day rate

(3:21:05) Day rate

 Yeah Like if she's booked for a photo shoot it's probably going to be in the six figures

 Six figures

 probably

(3:21:10) Whereas like a regular model like

 for ecom probably getting 500 to a couple

(3:21:15) thousand a day Correct

 Okay

 Yeah Yeah Where do you are you like in the five figure

 area or it it depends on the

(3:21:22) project but um yeah ecom it's like couple thousand a day

 Okay Rock and roll

(3:21:28) Aren't you worried though with like AI and [ __ ]

 like

 about what

 like being a model

 no cuz I'm aging out That's for

(3:21:34) the next generation to worry about

 They do You think there's there's got to be a worry there like the AI stuff is close

(3:21:42) to being

 they almost got the fingers down

 but

 they're Yeah the fingers are good now Anyways

 but it is cheaper to

(3:21:48) use for companies and as someone who you know understands business I understand

(3:21:54) why they're using AI models

 Mhm

 Got it Yeah

 You said I don't know if we need to

(3:22:00) get into this You're friends with Emily Saves America and I guess me and that was in your original messages though Me

 Uh okay We have Karen Going

(3:22:39) to Karen Wait Karen Oh this Karen Hold on I need to I need to go this Karen first then I'll go the Karen

 Karen

(3:22:45) You're never going to get it right I need to just call me car

 Okay Uh you said you started playing golf The

(3:22:51) revenge story

 Oh yeah That was pretty funny I think I just I So basically when

(3:22:58) I started playing golf I kind of did it because I the guy broke up with me cuz

() 

(3:23:05) it was very complicated But basically one guy said that he was that I dated

(3:23:11) before said that he was still talking to me but I wasn't And so he thought I like was cheating on him and I wasn't And so

(3:23:19) he broke up with me So I was like "Fuck this guy." Like he likes golf I started playing golf because like his family

(3:23:26) plays golf and I was like if he's not going to like talk to me I'm just going

(3:23:32) to like become this like hot golf babe and like blow up my Instagram to like

(3:23:37) you know be like haha And it blinked didn't happen But we did get back

(3:23:43) together and then it just didn't like we aren't friends anymore or anything like that But yeah it was a very interesting

(3:23:51) way to get into the world of golf which I don't know Do you guys play golf Yeah

 Nope

 What's your handicap

 oh I'm

(3:23:58) not very good I just go to the driving range

 Okay

 And we go to Tory Pines every now and then And

 you wrote uh prior to

(3:24:07) your social media career you were you were an alpha female

 or you still are an

(3:24:12) alpha female

 I feel like Well I feel like I was I think the concept of what

(3:24:17) Oh sorry I think where I was going with that is like in relationships I feel like I always kind of am have been an

(3:24:24) independent woman and like took care of myself I've been like financially independent since I was like 18 and just

(3:24:31) like always worked Um and I think I was really working hard before my social

(3:24:36) media career I uh ran my I worked in marketing and did marketing for a

(3:24:42) software company and then an oil and gas company Then I started my own marketing agency and I had like 12 clients and it

(3:24:48) was very difficult cuz I was like working like 13our days and stuff and it was like 7 days a week and it was way

(3:24:56) too much work for me So I felt more of like an alpha female when I was like almost the provider in like the

(3:25:02) relationship that I was in And then like now I think with social media and just like kind of I don't know I I definitely

(3:25:10) have become like less alpha and just more like laid-back and relaxed the last like 5 years I don't know if they go

(3:25:16) hand in hand but yeah it's true I don't know

 Okay

 So

 but you said you want the guy to be the alpha in the relationship

(3:25:22) Take care of their Yeah

 They have it both ways I think in order like I don't

(3:25:28) know if any of you girls can relate but I think that like when you are like an independent woman who's like taking care

(3:25:33) of yourself like the man needs to step up for you so that you can kind of just

(3:25:39) let your guard down and just like not have to feel like you have to be the protector or like the bread winner

 True

(3:25:45) Shouldn't no woman feel like that in the first place cuz you're a woman You're not you can't do what a man can do So to think that you're an alpha female is

(3:25:52) like it's silly because you're not a alpha Alpha is a man's position

 I know it was for lack of better terms but I

(3:25:58) think independent is probably better Like independent woman

 And why would you want to be an independent woman if you want a man

 i don't I don't want to be

(3:26:04) one I just I've just like had to be one I've been on my own since I was like 18 Not on my own I have family of course

(3:26:10) but you know financially independent and doing my own thing Like it's not like I

(3:26:16) can depend on someone else you know You is it was you you couldn't get anybody

(3:26:22) to depend on you or you couldn't get anybody to depend on or is that you chose not to

 you said it right the first

(3:26:28) time I could get people who could depend on me

 So why didn't you use that

 why didn't you have people Why didn't you

(3:26:34) depend on people if you could get that if you could get that to happen for you no I was saying the first time you said it wrong was the right though because

(3:26:40) people were depending on me Like I was hustling so hard and it was almost like I was the bread winner in my

(3:26:45) relationships for multiple reasons like they would be like um you know starting

(3:26:50) a career or whatever it was like oh I'm going to be like making more money later So then I was like the main one that was

(3:26:57) making the money when I had like all my marketing clients and stuff like that

 So you want a man to depend on you or you

(3:27:04) want a man to depend on but you also didn't mind providing

 it can't be both

(3:27:09) ways You either you know want a man and you depend on him

 And then it's not just

(3:27:14) even financially or you be an independent woman and not depend on a man But you cannot have it both ways You

(3:27:21) can't say you're an alpha woman and ask a man to do all of this for you because

(3:27:26) that what that sound like to him is that you don't need him And what a man wants to do is be needed

 right but I' and I

(3:27:32) I've never asked a guy I've never depended on a man financially like for like in a relationship You know what I

(3:27:38) mean i'm not but I I'm I'm also like I'm not

 I don't know My take on it is like I

(3:27:43) do want to be like I want like a traditional like relationship I think

(3:27:49) where the man kind of just goes to work Of course I'm going to have my own money Of course I'm still going to have like

(3:27:54) my own like world and job and life but I I

(3:28:00) I'm not getting at it like from a financial standpoint I'm just saying like he just needs to step up and be the provider And in the relationships that

(3:28:07) I've been in I don't feel like I can let my guard down around them until he does that

 So you saying that you would be in

(3:28:14) a relationship but you would still have your own what's the point of being in a relationship

(3:28:19) well I mean you're still you're still with that person you want I

(3:28:26) mean I'm a monog Oh my gosh

 What do you mean your your own cuz like you mean

(3:28:31) financially

 no she said that Yeah She'd be in a relationship with somebody but she still have her own her own life her

(3:28:37) own this But if you're in a relationship with somebody you share a life with them So why is it exclusion if you're in a

(3:28:43) relationship with that person

 i don't think it is in a relationship I'm just saying that I'm still going to have my own life and like bank account probably

(3:28:50) And

 like my my husband and I have completely separate bank accounts You have anything no we don't We don't We

(3:28:58) just work it out And I say to him "Give me money." And he gives me money And it's just like there's certain things I

(3:29:04) take care of and certain things he takes care of And if I need money for something he gives it to me But we have

(3:29:09) completely separate bank accounts We didn't meld them at all

 And what's the point of being married if you can't share an account with your husband

 you

() 

(3:29:15) know I can share an account with him but it's just a pain in the ass It was just easy

 It ain't that much of a pain in the ass All you got to do is put all that

(3:29:21) money in one pot

 But then I we got to we got to transfer from his and then from mine Now it just sounds like excuses

(3:29:27) because you in a relationship and you whole married

 and you saying that you got a separate account

 I think a lot of

(3:29:34) married people have separate bank accounts Yeah

 You know

 and that's what's wrong with marriages nowadays I think we

(3:29:39) need to change the traditional route of marriage

(3:29:46) By the way Jade I don't know Your your boyfriend sent me a DM

(3:33:08) athletes celebrities Uh you said that you struggle finding quality men

(3:33:15) They're not quality men Um

 well I think for me it's harder too because they play golf And so there's a lot of really good

(3:33:22) guys in golf but it makes your dating pool in that like most women they can

(3:33:28) just go on Tinder and like you know they have a 100% dating pool but how many guys like play golf so it's like it cuts

(3:33:34) it down

 Tiger Woods you

 Tiger Woods

 I I'm not going to say you gave him Just

(3:33:40) kidding No I wish Not

 you wish

 No but I mean

 I can I can link you up if you want I I mean he's definitely like one of my

(3:33:47) idols

 Yeah but he's just looking for something casual right now Are you like DTF

(3:33:52) like he's not trying to like do wifey like you know he just wants like a quick I think he has a he has a girlfriend right now

 Yeah but that didn't stop him

(3:33:58) in the past

 He's really nice though I wouldn't do that But like let's say he was single Like could I link you guys up

(3:34:04) or

 if he was single

 but just for like a quickie

 No I mean can I play his golf

(3:34:10) course before or

 just kidding anyways uh you said struggles You struggle finding

(3:34:16) quality men and dating while being an independent and conservative woman with traditional outlooks But

 those are big

(3:34:23) words

 Hold on Rewind the tape

(3:34:29) Yeah conservative and tra traditional

 Are you you're traditional

 i mean compared to

 the OAF

 I

() 

(3:34:37) mean again going back to what I said originally is like you can once you like start an OF you get kind of put in this

(3:34:44) box and there is always going to be outliers

 Do you show your vagine

 no

 you

(3:34:49) don't show your vagine

 No

 Really girl you could have you could have had a

(3:34:56) bunch of subscribers by saying maybe I do maybe I don't

(3:35:02) I don't know I've seen your Instagram and that's public

(3:35:07) There's cameltoe on there bro That's not traditional You can't That's not traditional

 I think I think a lot of it

(3:35:13) is just like that is

 you pull those [ __ ] things up

 My shorts up more

 I

(3:35:19) know Yeah Girls got to breathe Yeah You don't got to hold on to that traditional idea If you if you like showing your

(3:35:26) body and showing it off that's okay

 Yeah but she can't claim traditional though You can't traditional or conservative

(3:35:32) Yes I

 agree with that But I

 I mean she could want to deport all the immigrants and still be a trumpet

 Like that's okay

(3:35:40) Like you can be you can be the biggest hoe ever and be like I don't want any

(3:35:47) illegal immigrants I want uh I don't know Uh you could be against abortion I

(3:35:52) guess you could um not be a woke and still show your butthole on the internet

(3:35:58) Like it it's possible you can be both So I guess conservative what are you really conserving though maybe you

 I guess like

(3:36:06) in Republican I think

 you're a Republican I think who I am as a person

(3:36:11) am like I am very conservative and traditional as a person but when you look at my online identity it's like way

(3:36:18) different than like who I am and I think that's what's interesting and like why I consider myself like an outlier

(3:36:25) conservative that could be debatable because maybe like your actual politics if we're speaking specifically about

(3:36:31) politics like yeah you agree with like the Republican uh you know just across

(3:36:36) the board all the positions traditional Not willing to grant that you're traditional while you're showing

(3:36:42) your butthole on the internet

 I wouldn't really necessarily like butthole I think that's

 not necessarily butthole

(3:36:49) Half a butthole You show a portion of the butthole

 I'm telling you like like there what what is your like idea of an

(3:36:56) Only Fans girl like what is she doing on there

 well we've had we've had Only Fans girls who come on the show and then they

(3:37:01) lie about their content Oh I don't do that And then it's like literally I don't know if like somebody in the

(3:37:07) discord or in on Instagram can be like actually Brian I I found her she's doing

(3:37:13) hardcore corn she's doing XYZ

 cuz these hoes don't be proud they don't be proud

(3:37:19) they be ashamed of what they do cuz they look at their only fans as just a job and not like you know something to be

(3:37:25) proud of If you showing your body off show your body off But if you going to do something

 do it

 Do it

 Do that [ __ ] 10

(3:37:32) toes down Do that [ __ ]

 Be proud All these only fat hoes always talk about I don't do this I don't do that It's okay

(3:37:38) if you do but just be proud of it

 Be proud of it

 Where are you running away from the coop why you running be proud

(3:37:44) of your body

 If you put your [ __ ] lips on live put your [ __ ] lips on live Like I

 sweat those [ __ ] lips

 When I first we

(3:37:51) bleach our asses for a reason

 What the [ __ ] when I first started my OF I didn't even

(3:37:57) show my boobs Like I literally was like I'm very like I don't you know I think

(3:38:03) I just think that it was like very I think that you just get placed into this and I think I've made a lot of money of

(3:38:10) from people assuming I am doing these things

 You go wrong by letting people place you in that box Don't let nobody

(3:38:16) put you in a box

 And that's why I say like

 okay then if you want to show your titties you show your titties That's why

(3:38:22) you got to Only Fans We already know what's going down on only showing her ass She's showing titties Ain't nothing

(3:38:27) wrong with that

 Is she Is she posting wait Nick you don't don't look for it

(3:38:33) Nick

 Wait are you What are you doing she's already subscribed

 No don't don't worry about it Nick Close Don't Don't

(3:38:39) look it up Don't look it up cuz switch I'm just saying like I it took me a lot

(3:38:44) because I mean it was really hard for me to start my only fans because golf I knew I was going to be falling on that knife because golf is such a

(3:38:51) conservative world and

 have you ever put golf balls in your hoo-ha

(3:38:56) i don't know about you but I know them golf men

 Have you performed fellatio on

(3:39:02) a golf club

 what is like like what do you mean like with

 what do you mean what

(3:39:08) do I mean what do you mean like

 what like

 fellatio

 The oral singing the dwa

(3:39:17) Noing

 I think I've done a couple cute like things where I'm like like posing

(3:39:22) with it or like something and I have like my tongue out like on the the grip but it's not I would never I don't do a

(3:39:29) lot of

 I know

 I love that for you

 Um

 but I don't think Look you do Only Fans Your

(3:39:36) camel toe is all over the place on your Instagram I don't think I don't know if you can

(3:39:42) even claim conservative I mean

 I don't know if you can claim conservative

 online I don't look

(3:39:47) conservative or

 what are your thoughts on immigration you want to do you want to deport them

(3:39:53) all

 i am I am 100% for immigration

 Do you want to deport this Canadian

 do it right No

 Do you want to deport this poor

(3:39:59) Canadian Cuban woman

 i I I want I have a lot of friends who are immigrants My friends from Greece I had one from

(3:40:06) Hungary

 I have a lot of white friends from Cypress

 Wait so you don't want to deport the illegal immigrants

(3:40:12) no I I I think that it should be done legally I 100%

 we should legally deport

(3:40:19) the illegal immigrants I agree with you I agree with you

 Let's legally deport them

 Yes

 No but I'm saying if they're

(3:40:27) illegal like I'm saying if I'm I'm all for immigration if they do it legally Yeah I'm talking about illegal

(3:40:32) immigration

 Illegal immigrants And if in the country Yeah I mean

 I think if

(3:40:38) there's

 I'm trying to understand your conservative

 That's what I I do agree with that

 Yes I think that I if this is

(3:40:44) our country

 are you pro-choice or pro-life

 i'm pro-life

 Okay Are you

(3:40:52) I just think there's a lot of like most of the time I'm going to be on the right side of things right down straight

(3:40:58) across the board And I think that there's also I mean for pro-choice and

(3:41:04) pro-life I think the only exceptions are like if there's like health thing but okay

 I don't

 Yeah Okay Or like Yeah But

(3:41:12) yeah Well okay Moving off the politics though I think it's going to be very difficult to claim traditional

(3:41:18) but BTW link bio

 I know it is hard and I think it reflects on the dating for me

(3:41:24) too It's hard cuz I think well whoever you think whoever you know they didn't

(3:41:29) able to accept you That's simple So y'all y'all finding men who don't accept y'all for what y'all do And that's why

(3:41:35) all these Only Fan hoes they ashamed to say what they do on camera because they got these men that like it at first and

(3:41:41) then they get these men and these men trying to change them But y'all don't need to find those men that try to

(3:41:46) change y'all Find the men that accept y'all for who y'all are Holl at me if you really want that madam

 Do you think

(3:41:52) that these OF girls are hoes yeah

 How we got two We got three OF girls here

 She's

(3:41:58) She's call

 Leah right that's her name She's calling you a hoe

 Are you going to

() 

(3:42:04) let her Are you going to let her talk to you like that

 i honestly don't really care about her opinion Like that's her

(3:42:09) opinion She

 You're fine with her

 She wants to argue So

 Be proud of that [ __ ] How do you feel

(3:44:38) stuff

 Um

 I think she's argumentative

 I'm not arguing I'm just having a conversation Now you getting offended is

(3:44:45) not me being offended I just uh know an argument Well you were and you're not proving your point If you not I'm from

() 

(3:44:52) Houston Texas

 Well all I'm saying is if you going to have an opinion back it up That's all I'm here to do

 You just had

(3:44:58) so you can't say I'm argumentative If all I'm trying to do is have a conversation if you can't prove your point that's your fault not mine

 That

(3:45:05) was the point we needed to prove

 He asked us "Do we agree with her that we are host?" We don't agree That's what we

(3:45:10) were saying I wasn't arguing with you when you

 little more Kubana but you but you push your ass on my own

(3:45:17) I do and I'm proud

 Okay then say it Stop saying it

 [ __ ] I said it like I never said I wasn't

 Okay then you don't got to

(3:45:23) get offended All I'm saying is you're offended by how you act She's not

(3:45:28) hoarding your opinion

(3:45:35) I never said I was a brow How do you think I'd pay for the trip here

 no that's good for you baby girl But all I'm saying is if you going to be on Only

(3:45:41) Fans be proud to do it Don't be ashamed Instagram

(3:45:47) All I'm saying is y'all not acting like it

 I was never like

 "Yeah that energy don't lie

 Why are we acting like we're

(3:45:53) we're

 Energy don't lie?" Because at first it's okay Only Oh yeah I'm a hoe

(3:45:58) baby

 I'm the best hoe I'm the classiest one too

(3:46:04) I'm a valuable woman That's what I am She's calling you a hoe She wasn't saying me cuz I'm not a hoe She said she

(3:46:10) says you got O though You got Oo But she thinks that makes you a hoe

 But that's her opinion I think she's a hoe

(3:46:17) Doesn't she don't even remember how many people she slept with

 but the thing is if you Now we going back to the

(3:46:22) conversation Now you a virgin but you stick fingers up So now we all over the place If you going to go that route

 if

(3:46:28) you going to go that route then we can be all over the place But what we going to do is stick to the topic

 Then that I mean why didn't you get paid for it it's

(3:46:35) crazy You know what I mean all I'm saying is you said you don't do this you don't do that on Only Fans Like it's

(3:46:40) something wrong with it

 But now it's nothing wrong with it There's nothing wrong with it

 There's nothing wrong with

(3:46:46) it I just choose not to do it But if you're going to be having sex with all these people polyamorous people and you

(3:46:51) think that there's nothing wrong with sleeping with multiple people but you're really gaining nothing out of it Who's the real hoe

 who's not who's not gaining

(3:46:58) nothing out of it because I know if I set a standard and I say if I if I ask somebody to do something am I going to

(3:47:04) talk is getting something out of [ __ ] somebody because I literally don't do that

 It just sound like y'all taking it personal baby girls And I'm not trying

(3:47:10) to offend y'all All I'm doing You want to prove it you love to argue You love

(3:47:15) to go back to the facts and to what's other words that she said i don't

 both of y'all talking at the same time I

(3:47:21) don't hear I don't hear nobody with y'all talking at the same time So if both of y'all want to talk

(3:47:26) you ain't saying nothing all week You ain't saying nothing

 You ain't saying nothing all day And I'm going to be that

(3:47:32) [ __ ] I don't give

 Keep saying it You do give a [ __ ] cuz you over here in this little ass red dress talking about

(3:47:37) nothing

 [ __ ] you told me to wear red Like what's wrong with her

 what are we talking about

 you see what I'm saying

(3:47:42) what are we talking about

 because all all it does is sound like all of y'all are taking offense Are you okay y'all

(3:47:49) can't accept

 Are you okay that she called you a hoe i said I'm not a hoe Not accept

(3:47:56) We don't have an issue I'm not a hoe But if you want to say I'm a hoe [ __ ] it's not your opinion I don't give a [ __ ] Yeah I can have an opinion right i never

(3:48:02) said that The only reason I got irritated Let's get back Did I say that you're not proud You're not proud You're

(3:48:08) the one bragging about all the people you slept with Have you seen us trying to like push our business on to these

(3:48:13) you know people although y'all can go subscribe to my page But have you seen us doing that you don't even work for

(3:48:19) that industry So why are you bragging about sleeping with all of these men as a way to get what kind of attention and

(3:48:25) it's for free I mean

 who was bragging about people I slept with who Who did that

 you You were

 So I did that Yeah you

(3:48:32) facte

 I felt that you were bragging

 Now you're wrong

 That's my perspective

 And now you're saying that I'm proud Now

(3:48:39) you're shaming me for being proud because now it just sounds like you're upset that I'm proud to be who I am You

(3:48:46) are not And I'm calling that into question

 Y'all aren't proud of yourselves Y'all aren't proud of yourselves Just because we're not

(3:48:51) boastful about the things that we do sexually with other people We haven't talked about it You have But if you want

(3:48:57) to talk about it and then call us hoes when you're like boasting and bragging and for what where's the link you're

(3:49:03) just telling us stories No they can just picture it as you know

 Free marketing for what why would we waste our time

(3:49:10) like that

 she's promoting already

 Okay Okay She's going to do something then do

(3:49:16) it That's all I'm saying

 Uh we are doing all I said was energy doesn't lie You

(3:49:23) over here whispering Yeah I do Only Fans I don't even know I have one question Energy don't lie If you do it you do it

(3:49:29) Now you mad cuz I'm proud You mad cuz I'm confident That's all it sound like to me

 Nobody's mad or worried

 That's all

(3:49:35) it sound like to me Because I ain't say if y'all really heard me I didn't say nothing wrong I'm on y'all's side But

(3:49:41) y'all can't see that because all you hear is what you feel being in your [ __ ] emotions You being all you hear

(3:49:47) is what you feeling You in your emotions like a little [ __ ] That's what you So you started that's what you acting like messy messy [ __ ] said trying to call us

(3:49:55) out

 I didn't take your [ __ ] personal We asked

 you taking it personal by not having a conversation about it cuz what

(3:50:00) it sounds like is y'all are arguing a little [ __ ] I took personal

 Sorry

(3:50:05) took personal

 supposedly

 Who's the new leader of Cuba

 his like um like his brother's son

 That's all

 It's all in the family though always But I feel like if uh if

(3:50:56) you to jail Straight to jail

 Straight to jail Right

(3:59:12) that that fulfill their

 their name legacy of being a Karen How many Karens have you known that act like that

(3:59:20) thousands

 Lies

 Thousands I know Too many None

 Moving through the uh pre-show

(3:59:26) notes we have Ki Carrie Ki

 Ki

 Ki

 Uh you say you have autism

 Yes

 You uh in the

(3:59:34) the thingy that this thing although even before the show I don't know if you changed it

(3:59:40) Oh wait No that's the wrong one Uh you say that minimum annual income that you

(3:59:46) will accept for a partner is $480,000 a year Yeah Very

 Is that how much your

(3:59:51) boyfriend makes or whatever

 quite possibly

 What's he do for work

 uh he

(3:59:57) does uh organ and tissue transplant and recovery

 Oh nice

 Whoa

 Nice

 Nice Is that

(4:00:03) uh is he

 makes half million research

 uh no He does um basically Well now he's moved to the tissue side Oh no

 So he's

() 

(4:00:10) into tissues like bones

 But if you were to break up selling a realistic estimate

(4:00:15) of his earnings did you say this because like this is what your current partner's income is

 uh

(4:00:22) no Um I I believe that in a relationship it should be about for me it's about

(4:00:28) alignment and I want uh somebody in my life that

(4:00:34) is on the same levels as uh goals and ambitions and education and um I'm not

(4:00:43) necessarily saying that you have to make this amount of money but if you are making those types of figures you're

(4:00:50) well uh likely well educated ated probably uh disciplined probably honest

(4:00:57) hopefully although there are rich people that are not honest so maybe I take that

(4:01:02) back and um I would hope that they would be able to kind of have a center a

(4:01:10) streamlined focus of goals for their life and not just be a big crazy like

(4:01:17) spender with all sorts of just willy-nilly not no motivation

(4:01:23) And um you know I I I respect the process So if someone is working towards

(4:01:29) that to make that a goal then that's totally acceptable as well you know and

(4:01:35) that is the goal that my current boyfriend has for a position that he's looking for So um I support him fully

(4:01:44) and that's where I stand Well if you if you broke up with your current boyfriend would this be your standard annual

(4:01:50) income

 i think so

 I think I should always uh go bigger and better than

(4:01:56) what's previous

 How much do you make just curious

 Uh I make well above that You You Wait you make well above

(4:02:01) $480,000 didn't recognize

 Uh

(4:02:06) wait what and what's your Do you have a singular job title

 uh so I'm a I was a

(4:02:11) field epidemiologist Now I'm a research scientist but I also teach special ed

(4:02:16) Well they don't pay very well

 No that's just that's just for fun

 How Wait question Uh are you doing that full-time

(4:02:23) uh I I special education

 Yeah I start in August and then um I do research sign

(4:02:29) projects on the side

 Wait so side hustle is the thing that makes you the most

(4:02:36) money

 correct Why wouldn't you dedicate more of your time to the thing that earns you more

(4:02:42) money

 because I enjoy teaching special ed I enjoy kids How much hours uh per week or per month do you spend on this

(4:02:49) side hustle that

 maybe about 20 hours a month

 are you a consultant

 no

(4:02:57) This sounds a little fishy

 Yeah Sound like somebody lying

 My boyfriend need I think he needs to do wellness

 But okay

(4:03:02) As a special education Hold on hold on Hold on As a special education teacher

(4:03:07) you probably get paid what $50 $60,000 a year

 Oh I don't even know I It's like 35

(4:03:14) an hour 45 an hour or something like that

 I don't think teachers period

 It's not that much Make much

 It's not that

(4:03:20) much No

 And that's your full-time job

 it Yeah I guess so Then how do you say

 well I just started

(4:03:28) She starts in August

 Yeah I start in August

 So is your income going to go down

 no

 Or is it going to stay the same

(4:03:33) i hope it doesn't go down It depends on my work ethic and my project making well over half a million a year doing 20

(4:03:42) hours a month

 I'm in the realm of Okay Like consulting work

 no Research I work

(4:03:48) for Cedar Sinai

 Oh

 but you only do 20 hours a month

 I'm PDM

 What do you mean

(4:03:54) PDM

 do you know what PDM is

 yeah I know what PDM is

 Yeah So

 so you get

 So I I

(4:03:59) get paid when I work but um then there's projects you you say you work on

(4:04:05) something that's like um like there's a grant and I say I make

(4:04:12) a study and I get grant funding for that study Yeah

 Then I can take some of that

(4:04:18) grant I can pay research associates I can pay grad students I can pay other scientists and

(4:04:26) I can pay myself So

 So you get what what you pay

 depends on what depends on

 you talking about

(4:04:32) your Okay So are you factoring in the entire grant before expenses

 no

 So after

(4:04:39) expenses you make how much per year

 um anywhere from 300 to 600,000 depending

(4:04:46) on the year

 And you work full-time as a special education teacher and then you do 20 hours a month anywhere from 20

(4:04:53) hours to sometimes I'll have 300 hours It really def that's pdeium And then

(4:04:58) there's some months that I don't do anything and I'm flat broke that whole month because I'm not doing anything So

(4:05:04) right But I'm I'm looking at it annually Right

(4:05:09) So you do you have do you have a company no

 you don't have a company

 I have a dog walking company

 Wait hold on

(4:05:17) typically don't the grants and six businesses right now

 but grants look I'm

(4:05:24) not an expert in this field

 but grants typically don't flow directly to individuals

 no you have to work on a

(4:05:30) team

 they flow to an organization or a business organization funds it to people

(4:05:36) like my dad used to do it when I was a kid we he did a bunch of grants and they they pay a lot of money they make a lot

(4:05:42) of money doctors scientists they make a ton

 and then there's public speaking speaking there's uh symposiums there's

(4:05:49) events there's all sorts of There is consulting not as a consultant but there

(4:05:54) is consulting There is also um

 how much wait how much could you make if this was your full-time thing though

 uh probably

(4:06:02) 700 to 1.2 if I really put effort into it If I didn't have me being the way I

(4:06:11) am as a person What the [ __ ] seems dubious

 What the

(4:06:17) hell does that mean you saw all over the place But I'm not wellversed enough in

(4:06:24) grant research and to be able to say anything definitive But it when somebody

(4:06:30) tells me their full-time job is a spe special education teacher and then they like moonlight as a like grant

(4:06:38) researcher and you're making anywhere from 300,000 to $600,000 a year only And the bulk of

(4:06:45) that is coming from 20 hours of work a month

(4:06:51) I don't know It sounds a little sounds a little suspicious I don't know

 And then

(4:06:56) you said that you

 you be broke sometimes throughout the month

 Yeah I mean sometimes I don't work It'll be like a

(4:07:01) whole month where I'm not doing anything Got you And you want a man to match being broke cuz that's what you said You will m you can match

 I mean if if that's

(4:07:08) what it is it can be

 So it can't be both You got to pick a side baby girl

 He can be

 You can't have it both ways You can't

(4:07:14) say you want a man to make this and then be broke sometimes and then say that you can make this

 You sound all over the

(4:07:21) place

 That's fair Let me let me rephrase that I am not broke I am not in uh

(4:07:26) receiving income for that time

 but I have plenty of savings

 So you'd be okay

(4:07:32) with your partner not receiving income at the same time as you

 correct

 At the same time as you saying you could only

(4:07:39) want somebody that makes what $400,000 a year That's would that would be ideal How can both be true

 i don't think Hold

(4:07:47) on I Okay

 to in her defense

 you would agree that like let's say somebody does

(4:07:53) one gig a year on one day and they make a million versus somebody who works five

(4:07:59) days a week and they get paid $20 an hour You would agree that while it's

(4:08:04) true that that person who works that gig one day of the year and he's broke I

(4:08:11) guess according to you would be broke the other 364 days of the year They're still annualized making more money

(4:08:19) They're making a million dollars a year but they only work one day So I wouldn't look at it as they're

(4:08:25) broke those other days of the year They just only had to work one day to make more money than that person who works

(4:08:34) five days a week and gets paid $20 an hour

 Yeah I'm not calling into question the pockets I'm calling into question

(4:08:40) your principles and your truth and your honesty

 That's it

 What okay

 Cuz if you

(4:08:47) say you want this but you want that but you want this but you want that you just sound all over the place

 I actually

(4:08:52) think she makes sense

 If that's your truth Brian

 it is my truth

(4:08:58) Thank you I want you to affirm my truth Can you affirm my identity

 you've done that already

 Can you affirm my identity

(4:09:06) you're good

 Huh

 i said you did that already So good for you

 I Everything we've spoken on tonight I identify as

(4:09:13) the correct person on everything I've talked about tonight Please affirm my

(4:09:18) identity as the correct person

 Live in your truth baby No

(4:09:25) but I want you to affirm my identity I guess we'll wait I would but you

(4:09:32) called me a four so I'm not going to support it

 Okay

(4:09:37) What are you talking about

 you know what fine You're 4.5 Does that change anything

 thank you Yes it does It changes

 All right Now we're friends

(4:09:43) again I guess Now we're friends

 Cool

 Uh okay Moving through the rest of the notes here Uh let's see

(4:09:50) Uh you wanted to talk about dating while being on the autism spectrum

 I can talk about that for ages Uh what it's like

(4:09:57) also dating someone in the autism spectrum and what that's like as well and how our communication is different

() 

(4:10:03) in neurotypical relationships

 Sure

 Yeah It's uh it's very interesting Um I think

(4:10:10) I I don't know if anyone here is in like a differently aabled relationship

(4:10:16) um is that or no or has been in at all Uh it's different because you have to

(4:10:22) navigate things differently and I just wanted to hear what you guys would think of if you guys would be open to dating

(4:10:29) someone with disabilities and how would that affect your relationship How would

(4:10:34) you if you were the capable one or non-disabled person and dating somebody

(4:10:40) with a disability how would how would you how would things change for you and

(4:10:47) how would that change in your relationship and um for cuz for me both of us are um on the spectrum and then I

(4:10:56) actually have other disabilities and at 6 months into our relationship uh I had

(4:11:02) a massctomy and my boyfriend like knew this going into the relationship and he

(4:11:09) dropped everything and took care of me after six months and he could have ran you know he did everything took care of

(4:11:15) me and he's been a really great person there for me and but that's that part

(4:11:20) where one partner is disabled and one person is essentially the caregiver in

(4:11:26) that aspect And so I want to hear from other people that are not quote unquote

(4:11:32) disabled right um what what what you would think

(4:11:38) I have a lot of stuff but I think I

 Well I just I guess I guess I just want to

(4:11:43) hear what would you feel how would you feel dating someone that was disabled and what what would you do differently

(4:11:48) and what would you do the same and how would it affect your personal life so 100% for me I think autistic people the

(4:11:55) ones I've met are like the funniest coolest people I know and so smart and you're like a testament to that You have the best laugh and you're like you're

(4:12:01) the smartest one on the table like I said originally Um but I think when it comes to like people with disabilities

(4:12:09) like I don't really I mean if it affected my life like would I be able to

(4:12:14) handle that like for example I know this is like really bad example but I'm going to say anyways I adopted a senior cat

(4:12:21) last year and I knew what I was getting into with her and I knew it was g

(4:12:28) I knew she had a lot of health issues and it was a lot and it it took a lot and I had to have like when I travel and

(4:12:35) stuff like I know my lifestyle and I it was like I had to I I don't know if that

(4:12:40) fits with my lifestyle So when I'm with someone I it's going to fit I'm going to be with someone who fits my lifestyle

(4:12:46) Yeah But if it's someone's like like paralyzed or something like I don't

(4:12:52) really I don't really see a problem with that But I mean I don't think it's a problem It just it just depends

 Talk

(4:12:58) about autism

 Autism

 No not you Why are you asking about disable

 i'm just

(4:13:04) talking She said disabilities or a caregiver

 And she's like "Oh man I had

(4:13:09) my tit removed." I Oh well

 well we're just talking about disabilities now but

 just the tism

 just

(4:13:17) the tism okay now just dating people with autism

 100% I actually want boyfriend

(4:13:25) about you know dating as somebody with autism

 and then also dating people with autism

 so well communication is

(4:13:32) definitely difficult because for us we don't communicate like normal people uh

(4:13:38) first of all to get really nitty-gritty without sharing like all the details We're very professional

(4:13:45) all the time

 Do you guys send like thank you cards after you like have sex and stuff or like

 we basically

 email

(4:13:52) schedule do you schedule it

 we schedule Yes

 Oh

 yes

 I think I have autism

(4:13:58) We we schedule everything Everything has to be done on a schedule and it has to be done on the schedule at the exact

(4:14:04) time And if it's not done at that time everything falls apart Like if you get horny you're like "Oh it's not time

(4:14:10) yet."

 We don't

 like put the boner away That doesn't happen We don't We don't Wow

 get

(4:14:17) up until it's time You're like "Bring it on baby Come on."

 Is that like all people that are in the spectrum or just

(4:14:24) yourselves

 uh this is my experience with us Um for me I don't get quote unquote

(4:14:29) like turned on I have to mentally think like "Oh it's time to have you know

(4:14:34) intercourse." And now it's time to do the thing And okay I associate the bed

(4:14:43) and a naked guy with that Okay So I

(4:14:48) don't associate I I of course I've done all the wild things I've done you know on a laundry machine and on a balcony

(4:14:54) and in the back of a car Done it all I'm the right height for the laundry

(4:15:00) machine But but I I also feel like it we are very

(4:15:08) much very professional We respect each other's space We respect each other's boundaries No means no Yes means yes

(4:15:14) Like and we are able to communicate things very um simplistically though

(4:15:21) like we don't talk in depth We don't have in-depth discussions We don't really get on more like we we talk about

(4:15:29) beaver facts and orfish and space and what happens when you guys need to have

(4:15:35) a conversation that's like deeper

 right like

 um

 like if if it's something comes up and it's like

 usually he blows up and

(4:15:42) then I cry

 I wanted to go back to your thing Um have you ever thought like maybe you're asexual like

 I I've I've

(4:15:50) wondered that I someone told me about that but I I don't know if that's really a thing that would be for me I don't I

(4:15:59) enjoy it I like it when it's happening

 I feel like if someone is if someone is asexual like they probably don't like to

(4:16:06) cuddle or like you you and your boyfriend probably like cuddle and in bed or like on the couch or something or

(4:16:12) do you guys like

 We like we're we're professionally cuddle

 Yeah Okay

 You you

(4:16:17) enjoy you like being together Yeah

 I don't think that I think that maybe like asexual I feel like

 I don't know I'm not

(4:16:24) asexual I don't know the chat

 I'm just saying because of the thing that she said she doesn't get horny or she doesn't get turned on I think right i

(4:16:30) don't know if like you do get turned on after you start doing like it you know doing it But I have a friend and she

(4:16:35) really didn't get an idea of sex Like she would be like I don't know what you guys are doing She wouldn't masturbate or anything And like to her sex is like

(4:16:42) something that she knows she wants to do with her partner so that's why she's doing it But it's not like she's horny She wants that you know type of It feels

(4:16:48) like a chore

 It feels like something I just I have to do

 Wait till you get old

(4:16:53) But then when I do it I I like it I enjoy it for that short time and then

(4:16:59) I'm like when it's done I'm like "Okay I'm I'm done I'm done." Like afterwards I don't want to I want to go eat a pizza

(4:17:05) you know like I want to eat a pizza and find something to smoke So

(4:17:12) the more I listen to you the more I'm like I need to talk to a doctor I think that these are the requirements

 So it's

(4:17:18) just interesting kind of like navigating that and communicating and we definitely have a lot of things to work on with our

(4:17:26) communication because I think like you asked those in-depth conversations you

(4:17:31) know we kind of when it comes to like marriage and kids and stuff like the future stuff we don't really have those

(4:17:36) discussions We've kind of been you know in the beginning I asked him "What are you looking for?" You know yes

 How was

(4:17:42) your marriage as an autistic person uh

 was he autistic

 no he was not He He

(4:17:50) was not He might have probably likely had very bad ADHD

 Yeah

 Um and he had

 Was

(4:17:55) that difficult for you being in a relationship with someone who I guess doesn't have autism cuz like maybe your

(4:18:01) boyfriend now can like relate to you more cuz he also is in

 I masked for that

(4:18:06) entire relationship

 Really yes

 And I heard like females mask

 Yeah we mask the

(4:18:11) uh I'm very good at it Um and it's I did it for most of my life and I don't

(4:18:21) suggest it

 How do you mask autism

 it's uh what I'm doing right now I'm masking

(4:18:28) right now I'm acting completely normal and being uh respectful and taking my

(4:18:33) turn and see

 No No Like unhinged party

(4:18:39) Come on Come out Come out

 No You don't want that But I you know sitting politely and and

(4:18:47) you know they said don't touch the table Don't tap on the tables Don't fidget So I just got up I went outside for a

(4:18:52) little bit I got up a couple times But you know it's just um masking The same

(4:18:57) thing with behavior You can mask a behavior too So if I like I facial

(4:19:03) twitch a lot and so I have to constantly think not to scrunch my face And that's part of masking So in my whole

(4:19:09) relationship I didn't scrunch my face and I just had to sit and just have a

(4:19:14) normal face for 6 years and that takes a really emotional and

(4:19:21) um stressful toll on your body because you're being someone you're not exhausting

 Yeah it's exhausting You're

(4:19:27) being someone you're not

 Why do you choose to be somebody you're not

 well I think

 um it was a defense defense

(4:19:32) mechanism

 I see the face

 I heard like Yeah I want to see the face like what

(4:19:38) what face were you

 i just kind of like I do like

 Oh no this and I adorable and I It's actually cute It goes with the

(4:19:44) laugh

 I was going to say I heard that like females like start children especially like um

 they they learn to

(4:19:52) imitate better like females just in general like imitate like just take on like whatever more socially EQ probably

(4:19:59) aware and little boys running around But um I think that maybe maybe that played a role like being a female obviously and

(4:20:05) then just like taking that on and trying to just be normal

 you know act normal

(4:20:11) versus like just being yourself So is it more comfortable being in this relationship

 because you can be yourself

(4:20:17) around

 100% I mean our first Christmas he got me a body sock and it was like

(4:20:22) the best present ever

 A body sock is literally exactly what it sounds like It's just a giant rectangle that you are

(4:20:28) in sleeping bag

 It's like a rect like but the hole is in the middle like in the center and it goes around the top of

(4:20:34) your head And so the hole ends up being here

 And so you're basically like in a sack and it compress It's like soft

(4:20:41) silky compression and it compresses you and it it's like a

(4:20:47) hug

 Yeah And then he got me noise cancelling headphones and stuff So he's thoughtful with his gifts of like things

(4:20:53) that are helpful tools for me you know and so it's that's what you have to look

(4:20:59) at is that it's not a typical relationship of like like he's never bought me a diamond He's never bought me

(4:21:05) a necklace or a purse or shoes But thoughtful gift

 Yeah But fidgets you

() 

(4:21:10) know i have so many fidgets

 What's up

 i feel like I wanted to say that I think I'm a little bit autistic cuz I'm really

(4:21:15) bad at like lying or like my facial expressions

 You're bad at lying

 Is there anything you've lied about tonight

(4:21:21) Like what

 uh like my name

 Your name

 yeah I don't want to share

 Um

 autism is a

(4:21:28) real disorder I don't think it's okay to self diagnose So don't self diagnose

(4:21:33) I'm from Cuba I have ADHD I found out I have ADHD when I was 18 And honestly I

(4:21:38) think I'm autistic because since I was little I was like figuring out how am I supposed to act am I like what do I do you know what I mean and like eye

(4:21:43) contact I don't know if you noticed but anytime anybody moves I like make eye contact with them and stuff like that or like masking or like

 No Well what's it

(4:21:51) called noises Stuff like that Like it's a bit of ADHD I said I think I'm autistic I'm just saying that like when

(4:21:56) somebody asked me "Oh do you like this do you like that?" I like would make a face Like I always make faces It's just

(4:22:02) like Well

 I'm just saying like Did you lie about your age

() 

(4:25:41) pass should not matter Karen you agree with that statement

 wait Ken or Karen or

(4:25:46) Oh my god I'm just going to call you Special K

 Call me K Yeah Special K you

(4:25:52) agree that a woman's passion not matter madame Corpus Christi

 Madam Houston put

(4:25:58) some respect on my name

 Ryan whatever the hell your name is

 You want to talk about respect

 You

(4:26:04) want to talk about respect what

(4:26:12) that's what I thought

 That's what Damn Okay chill

 It's getting really

(4:26:18) tight in here He's not even blinking [ __ ] Uh

(4:26:24) Matt Okay you agree Leah you agree

 Jade

(4:26:29) does not agree I can't even read your penman and [ __ ]

 Sorry

 It's just like

(4:26:35) what is that can you read that

 that says Anna

 I mean

 that's just

(4:26:40) I know it's so I can see it But

 any of you need me to to write up something for you

 pretty right

(4:26:48) it's like a It's really

 focusing Okay whatever

 Because it was so pretty it

(4:26:53) couldn't focus

 Uh you seem to be fine I guess you don't dis you don't agree

 What

(4:27:00) was the question

 ki you think a woman's past should not matter oh

 okay

 Okay Uh so those of you

(4:27:08) who agree with that statement why should a woman's past not matter

(4:27:15) starting with you Wait a woman's past should not matter

(4:27:23) Yeah you circled Okay the statement is a woman's past should not matter You circle it indicating you agree with the

(4:27:29) statement Why

 oh I think I read it wrong So woman's past should matter

 I think

(4:27:36) that everyone's past should matter because

 um I think that those that was the first one So I didn't really

(4:27:42) understand Remember I asked you about the confused but I think I think it should

 I think it

(4:27:48) I know there's directions at the top I didn't even see the directions I know I'm really bad at like

 test It's okay

(4:27:56) Okay So I think I think everyone's pass matters

 300 IQ question whatever podcast

(4:28:02) questionnaire take

 I know

 Was it was in parenthesis the body count

 huh

 in that first question was in parenthesis body

(4:28:08) count

 Yes Body count in parenthesis

 I think everyone's past matters I think it

(4:28:14) makes them who they are And so that's why I agreed or I don't even know if I

(4:28:19) whatever

 But you agreed that a woman's past should not matter

 I know I did that

(4:28:25) wrong I did that backwards The first one I did backwards Everything else I got right

 Um

(4:28:30) you you

 Yeah

 Do I think a woman's past

(4:28:36) shouldn't matter i don't think a woman's past shouldn't matter because a man entering a relationship with a woman

(4:28:42) worried about her past is worried about the wrong damn thing He worried about her body count when he need to be worried about taking over her mind and

(4:28:49) you know controlling her in a way that she's never been able to with other men because those body counts don't matter

(4:28:54) if none of these men have ever dominated her in the way she needs to be dominated Joking me

 So you Okay

(4:29:03) Act like you understand so we can move on What what's with the attitude

 ain't no

(4:29:09) attitude I'm just talking

 So now now now that I got a little energy behind it it's an attitude Correct

 I need more

 A

(4:29:16) little attitude

 Can we get an attitude any Anybody else detect a bit of an attitude from uh from Miss Madam

 all I'm

(4:29:24) saying is what you asked me I answered your question That simple

(4:29:30) What oh Oh thank you

 Oh

 Oh thank you Is it okay with context a

 little bit of an

(4:29:36) attitude A little little uppidity A little uppidity

 I think we can all see it right

 what's that

 we can see it right

(4:29:44) i can see it

 Yeah

 It's like what she say What was that

(4:29:49) yes Say it in Spanish so we can all understand

 Impacto

(4:29:54) Leah A woman's past should not matter Why is that

 because um

 someone said

(4:29:59) "Brian why is your future wife upset at you?"

 I see that

 I don't know about that one Oh man I would never marry a bad

(4:30:06) bill man Um I think the woman's passion matter

(4:30:12) like a man's passion shouldn't matter either Like

 if a man is asking you how many people you slept with that should

(4:30:17) be a red flag I mean I get it If you have like a reputation or something like I guess me

(4:30:23) for example I do O and he's asking me I see that a little bit valid I guess But

(4:30:28) like let's say I don't know her her like you know she doesn't do O I think it would be a little bit offensive that

(4:30:34) you're like asking Wait

 it's my opinion

 Okay

 All right And

(4:30:40) then uh

 you ask these questions like the same question everybody

 You uh

 a woman's

(4:30:47) passion not matter Why is that

 i mean I would be a hypocrite if I said it did matter cuz I've been with quite a few

(4:30:53) people So

 Oh

 we love an honest woman Honesty is the best policy

(4:30:59) Oh

 what

 whose line is that

 such a concept Uh okay

(4:31:07) I'm uh I kind of want to wait until we have everybody back at the table before I get into the next thing So I'm going

(4:31:13) to come back to the that a woman should not be rejected because of her weight

(4:31:18) Leah you disagree And I'm trying to see if anybody else disagrees No that's it Leah why should

(4:31:26) uh or why do you do I guess uh agree with that why should a woman not

() 

(4:31:33) be rejected because of her weight because um

(4:31:38) I mean she could be I guess that's like the guy's like opinion

 Yeah but you you

(4:31:43) would say it's wrong right a little bit But

 why

 cuz I feel like

(4:31:49) it's a little bit rude But if a girl is asking a guy out she should know like

(4:31:54) kind of like if like she would be his type You know what I mean i hope

 Right

(4:31:59) Would you would you date a guy who's shorter than you

 depends

 on what

 the

(4:32:05) personality and all stuff other stuff Whatever the bare minimum personality is

(4:32:13) for you to date a guy who's 6 feet tall It's that personality but he's 4 foot 11

(4:32:21) Does he have other qualities that make him like better wait

 whatever the

 411

(4:32:26) Whatever the bare minimum Hold on Whatever the bare minimum personality or whatever metrics are for you to date a

(4:32:33) guy who's 6 feet That's what the guy who's 411 has

 No

 No

 No

 So the 411 guy

(4:32:40) has to make up for it in other ways

 Yeah I feel like 411 like what are we doing

(4:32:45) here like I'm kind of short That kid gets like But what that would You're saying your kids would be short

 Yeah But a tall guy

(4:32:53) is going to have to think that dealing with you

 But that's his like whatever Like

(4:33:01) I don't know Isn't that normal though like isn't there a lot of like tall guys with short girls

 yeah But I guess what

(4:33:06) I'm trying to explore here is you said a woman should not be rejected because of her weight

 but you would reject a guy

(4:33:11) because of his height But that is a very like big case 411 like okay you said four um 5'9 5'6 I would date that

(4:33:23) if you see like a big like super huge girl compared to like a skinny guy I feel like I see that like you know maybe

(4:33:30) but that's

 option

 Okay Uh let's see Well all right I think it's fine if a guy

(4:33:37) wants to reject a woman if she's overweight or underweight I suppose Uh

(4:33:42) wrong for a man to dump his girlfriend if she regularly turns him down for sex

(4:33:47) You agree that that's wrong madame you agree that's wrong uh

(4:33:54) oh Jade you wrote Wait Damn bro Jade you didn't follow the instructions What the [ __ ]

 i didn't

 You like wrote your answer

(4:34:02) next to it No you didn't even circle

 Oh well she got here a little bit

 I was I was filling it out as we were about

(4:34:08) Reading is essential Oh

 Oh So woman's passion

 So okay You think a woman's

(4:34:14) passion not matter uh no I do think it should matter

 Okay Yeah

 Wrong for a man to dump his Okay Uh

(4:34:21) wrong for a man to dump his girlfriend if she regularly turns him down for sex Ki you also think that that's wrong And

(4:34:30) Libby you think that that's wrong Uh so those of you who think that that's wrong you agree with the statement Why is that

(4:34:37) i mean it's a mutual thing It's an act between two people And if both people

(4:34:43) like aren't in agreement of that then at that time I don't know I think that

(4:34:49) it's not it shouldn't be something that's like forced upon

 Yeah I agree So consent is crucial but what I'm trying

(4:34:56) to get at here in in the question is it wrong for a man to dump his girlfriend

(4:35:02) if she regularly turns him down for sex we both agree that consent is absolutely

(4:35:07) necessary

 unequivocally

 Okay

 However if she's not having sex with him you're

(4:35:13) saying it's then wrong for him to dump her because of that

 Yeah I mean well if she doesn't want to have sex with him

(4:35:19) like then like I think it's something that you like need to get into the mood

(4:35:25) for And it's like if if they're her partner if she's like saying that she doesn't want to have sex with him like maybe there's the reason And if he dumps

(4:35:32) her because of strictly just not wanting to have like she doesn't want to have sex with her well and that's his

(4:35:37) priority then yeah I mean

 but the key word is like regularly Like it continuously happens

 Regularly turns him

(4:35:43) down for sex

 I would think something is going on there Like she doesn't like you or something

 Yeah that's kind of what I

(4:35:49) Yeah But then why is she in the relationship

(4:35:54) exactly

 Why are they in the relationship yeah that's true But like what if something happened like she got depressed or something happened in her

(4:35:59) life that now she doesn't really feel like having sex or something

 Maybe she's depressed because she's not having sex

(4:36:06) The chicken or the egg

 I don't know If you ain't getting laid you know it's uh

(4:36:12) Hey sex is like uh

 sex is natural People put so much pressure on sex And I get it

(4:36:19) if it means something I get it if it means something to you But it doesn't have to mean something to everybody just

(4:36:25) because it means something to you Sex is a natural thing So if you get into a relationship sex should be the bare

(4:36:30) minimum Like you you get into a relationship with somebody cuz I assume you like [ __ ] them because that's

(4:36:35) just something that you shouldn't settle for as a man or a woman So when you get into a relationship with somebody if

(4:36:40) they're withholding sex which is like the whole you know one of the main reasons for being in a relationship is

(4:36:46) to have somebody that you can have fun with If somebody is somebody that you can you know have fun sexually with I think it's okay to dump somebody for

(4:36:53) that because you you basically are miss incompatible

 Yeah You you deceiving

(4:36:59) somebody especially if it was about you know if you got the sex in the beginning and you're not getting it now Now you're

(4:37:05) just deceiving your partner

 You said it was wrong for a man to dump his girlfriend

 No I agree I agreed that it

(4:37:12) was right You agree no but the statement is wrong for a man to dump his girlfriend if she regularly turns him

(4:37:18) down for sex You circled it indicating you agree that it's wrong

 Oh well I disagree then I disagree with that

(4:37:25) Reading is important guys Reading is essential

 right

 uh I think that I think

(4:37:30) that they should talk about it and figure it out first

 Yeah sure

 And then if they can't come to if there's

(4:37:36) underlying issues that can't be fixed and the relationship is busted then the relationship is busted But if it's just

(4:37:42) solely based on sex alone then there's a communication

 Let's assume that's the

(4:37:48) only problem

 right

 then I

 So he goes to her is like "Babe is something wrong?" She's just like "No I just don't want to

(4:37:54) We have a different sex drive or whatever it is."

 And then he wants to have more sex That's the only problem

(4:38:01) And she regularly refuses him

 And he says "Babe I want to have more sex." And she says "No." I think that the

 under

(4:38:08) those circumstances would it be wrong for him to end the relationship

 i feel like it's right at the point

 It says not

(4:38:15) wrong

 If you're in a relationship and you have different preferences and it's going to come down to one person being

(4:38:20) unhappy and the other person being happy like you're not with the right person So I think it is like fair at that point

(4:38:27) But the way that it was stated it made it sound like the guy like

 she was rejecting him versus they had different

(4:38:34) sex drives Well because it did say

 well I mean I added that I guess But um but

(4:38:39) wouldn't wouldn't that make sense though that Well there could be multiple reasons why

(4:38:44) she's rejecting him for sex but uh I mean

(4:38:51) I don't want to paint it like there's some other nefarious issues going on in the relationship She's regularly turning

(4:38:58) him down for sex It's just kind of that simple seems like they're just like

 I I guess my question is what is the

(4:39:04) appropriate compromise in this situation he wants more sex she wants less sex

(4:39:10) Does he defer to her does she defer to him do they meet in the middle what's appropriate

 there is a possibility of

(4:39:17) both people getting what they want out of a relationship If you're not getting what you want out of the relationship then you don't need to be in it It's

(4:39:23) that simple

 There's compromise too

 Yeah there is compromise If you are sacrificing your principles

(4:39:28) or your morals or your beliefs or just anything as a basic natural right of having sex then you don't need to be in

(4:39:35) that relationship because you're lying to yourself and you lying to your partner thinking that that's going to be okay for the rest of your relationship

(4:39:41) cuz that's why the relationship ended in any anyway

 I feel like that happens a lot with like when you date like bisexual people like they think oh

(4:39:48) they're okay with like just one person like a woman or a man Correct

 But at the end of the day they're not It's all fun and games and hot when you know you hear

(4:39:55) that a woman likes women until you realize this woman is devoting her time to another woman She's giving her body

(4:40:01) to another woman and that intimidates you And if you think that's going to intimidate you then maybe you should

(4:40:06) rethink you know your dating choices in your lifestyle

 I feel like I was going to say the the best thing to do is to

(4:40:13) have a conversation with your partner and to see what's up after like a while like they say no and no and honestly at

(4:40:18) a point you can just like like walk away because that's not what you want Like you have to be happy too

 Correct

 I feel

(4:40:23) like when you're with the person for like many years you should try to work as much as you can but you shouldn't put your own like happiness at risk cuz a

(4:40:30) lot of people like you said get like dopamine or like ex I don't know what the word was out of like sex right

 yeah

(4:40:35) They get deceased

 You say dopamine

 no I was trying to say I don't know Yeah

 Oh

(4:40:40) yeah Anyways I'm just going to say that they should break up if they're not compatible

 What do you think on it

 well

(4:40:47) obviously my answer is from like a Christian worldview So do I think they should be having sex and like if they're

(4:40:54) not married no But I guess if you're asking if I was not a Christian I could

(4:40:59) understand why you would do that Or like marriage

 Yeah I think that's where you

(4:41:04) have to compromise and be like "Okay the wife you should then have more sex with

(4:41:10) your husband." And maybe it's not every time And there's like a give and take and laying down each other's your wants

(4:41:15) for the other person cuz two are becoming one Um now I don't know like what the exact ratio of like 50/50 on

(4:41:22) compromising that but I do think there's a duty for the woman to have sex with her husband and sometimes that means for

(4:41:30) the guy too maybe it's not that night So I think it's just like mutual love and respect in that scenario Um

 I feel like

(4:41:36) adding what what she said I feel like when you agree on a relationship you know what you're signing up for right if this person is like "Oh I'm saving

(4:41:41) myself for marriage." You you shouldn't expect this person to like have sex with you without marriage right but if you're like having sex and like you know years

(4:41:48) or whatever and out of nowhere you're saying no constantly something's going on I don't know That's wrong

 Switch Karen you have to hear from you Miss

(4:41:54) married Well obviously as you get older your sex drive changes somewhat but

(4:42:02) I don't know I'm I'm with you I I I think as a wife yeah you need to [ __ ]

(4:42:08) your husband That's your job is what put that on your W4 What did I do i [ __ ]

() 

(4:42:13) my husband So yeah

 There you have it from the married woman at the table

 I

(4:42:18) have a question Karen Is the sex drive different from men like older men compared to older women as like you know

(4:42:24) when they're age

 like like using my husband and I for an example absolutely Yeah He's older now too So

 but does he

(4:42:30) have like a like higher sex drive than you over like

 No we're about the same Okay

 He

(4:42:37) when we first met that's all we did It's all we did He was playing baseball and

(4:42:43) I'd fly to go see him and but then as you go on and we didn't even know each other That's the only way we knew each

(4:42:50) other was in the sack Literally it was one night right that's what I was talking like that last long when there's sexual

(4:42:57) like so much sexuality between like tension or chemistry that lasts for a

(4:43:02) long time

 And it wasn't until years later that we really really got to know each other and now we're best friends

(4:43:08) And and do we have sex four times a week like you know the real housewives do no

(4:43:14) Cuz you know what nobody does

 That's a lie That's a lie People that are 60 that

(4:43:20) are telling you they're banging five times a week They're not

 I mean do you even want to at that point

 i plan to

(4:43:28) Yeah People that you know are comfortable with themselves sexually they're you know comfortable enough to sleep with somebody on the first night I

(4:43:35) hear that those relationships last the longest because they not trying to fake the funk for nobody They know they both want to have sex and they both agree to

(4:43:41) it and it's you know

 I did it after dumped I had gotten dumped that day and I met him in a bar and my best friend

(4:43:48) was like "Just here's a handful of condoms Just do it." Best way to get over

 That's exactly what she said And I

(4:43:53) had never done that I was like "Oh my god I can't do this." And I'm like "Oh maybe I can."

 Wait hold on And wait how

(4:43:59) long were you in that relationship you said you got dumped that day right

 i

(4:44:04) had gotten dumped that day Yes

 But how long was it

 just a few months

 Couple months boyfriend

 Just a few months But

(4:44:10) it was like

 dump that day

 go to the bar handful of condoms from your friend

 have

(4:44:16) the one night stand and then it's like a rebound That's a rebound

(4:44:22) Well he No he says that He admits it He admit

 he admits he had he just like

(4:44:27) broken up with his girlfriend or something

 No he had one at the time but unbelie

(4:44:33) Yes He had many girlfriends He played baseball He had

 Oh

 gazillions of MLB all

(4:44:38) over the

 MLB

 No AAA

 Triple A Okay

 But he played for 16 years So that's

 Wow

(4:44:44) Pitcher

 No third base

 Third base You got to be careful Those third base guys

 At

(4:44:50) least he's not a short stop

 Take a bunch of them in third base

 He was that too at first He started off

 Okay But how long

(4:44:56) did it take for him to like make you his only girl like like cut up the other girlfriends

 oh god A long time Well I

(4:45:04) mean I thought I was the only girl In my mind I was the only girl but there were

(4:45:09) all kinds So we He probably wasn't monogamous to me till

 I would say it was

(4:45:16) a good five years later Five years

 Oh wow

 Five years

 Well we did

(4:45:23) the long distance thing for a long time Were you okay but were you dating other dudes

(4:45:29) That's the only difference between monogamy and polygamy But honestly I only saw a couple guys cuz I'm not a big

(4:45:35) dater anyway I don't go out with a lot of guys My body count is two hands worth

(4:45:40) of people I that was never kind of my thing And so I but I was so hung up on

(4:45:46) him It was hard for me to date other people cuz I'd meet them and it wasn't him So I tried but I just kind of hung

(4:45:54) in

 All right Uh I would not date a police police officer

(4:46:00) says Jade wore Jade

 Uh

 you said that's dumb

 Oh no That's dumb to be like I

(4:46:06) wouldn't date a police officer just cuz that's his job

 Okay All right

 Uh men should pay for first dates To which you

(4:46:12) said you agree Apparently Miss Corpus Christie is no Leah you think men should

(4:46:18) pay for first dates jade

 Madam Houston thank you for clarifying

 You're welcome

(4:46:24) And

 we need a counter No idea I don't remember

 You said Yeah You said men should pay for first dates K you said no

() 

(4:46:30) Uh Karen you said men should pay for first dates Libby you said men should pay for first dates Uh why should men

(4:46:38) pay for first aids

 i've like split the bill with guys

 You know what let's start with Libby We're going to go this way

(4:46:44) then we'll go this way

 Generally I think it's just chivalry And

 I do think

(4:46:49) obviously like if you are a radical feminist you can't expect that

 Okay Um

(4:46:54) but I think if you're kind of looking for a more traditional man and you are that traditional woman you should be

(4:47:01) able to expect that And I've had first dates where they don't pay and it's not a deal breakaker But it's just it's I

(4:47:08) think there are exceptions to the rule but there's a rule

 Okay All right Uh

(4:47:14) Karen why should men pay for first dates well if he's going to ask you out to dinner yeah he needs to pay

 All right

(4:47:21) you an

 oh um a man should pay for a first date simply because he's a man I'm a woman What would it look like if I

(4:47:28) paid for my own food i also don't do coffee dates The first time that they say they want to go on a coffee date I

(4:47:33) block them So you block if they offer a coffee

 Yeah Why do I want to sit around and drink coffee and be hyper with you

(4:47:39) for no reason that sounds awful So take me to dinner

 Like a gordita crunch or something

 why would I be eating a

(4:47:44) gordita crunch is that what kind of dates you take uh girls out on

 all the time Aren't you married

 that's That's

(4:47:50) something I go with friends and do but not

 Aren't you married

 no No He was joking

 Oh okay I was joking

 Wait what

 hm

(4:47:57) You think I'm married to a black woman yeah he was joking

 Oh he was joking about that

 He wishes he was

 No no no no

(4:48:04) Uh why should men pay on first dates

 uh again chivalry Great answer But also if

(4:48:10) he's going on a bunch of dates right obviously he'll be just spending money on everyone but if he's going to focus on one woman he should be okay with

(4:48:16) spending that money Okay What about you

 i feel like according to men our time is kind of

(4:48:22) like running out Like when we get older we're going to look ugly or whatever right so if I have to take my time to go

(4:48:27) on a date with this guy he better like make it worth it Also I feel like I could be at home alone cooking for

(4:48:32) myself So I it's like why would I go out with you

 okay

 To be entertained or something right

 all right Karen Karen

(4:48:40) Karen

 Um yeah I got it I was I

 Why should men pay for first dates if they

(4:48:45) ask you out on the date I feel like you they should be the one to pay

 Have you ever asked a guy out

 yeah And did I pay

(4:48:52) yeah But I I It's also chivalous It's like I'm like

 Sorry It's what

 chivalous

(4:48:58) Is that a word

 sorry One more time Shiverous

 Chivalous

 Okay Just Just Okay

(4:49:03) Shiverous Shiverous

 Shiver Shivery Chivalry

 Shiver Shivery Um I think I

(4:49:09) when I go on a date with a guy and then I always offer and it's nice to be

(4:49:14) denied

 and it it's just a nice feeling like they enjoyed the date and I

(4:49:19) definitely go splitsies but then if it's splitsies then it's like

 is it a date i don't know I could go I can go to dinner

(4:49:26) with my friends if you want to be friends we can split the bill Let's do it

 Okay Uh and then a follow-up question

(4:49:32) for those of you who think

 you didn't ask me

 You didn't indicate You didn't on your questionnaire

(4:49:38) You didn't circle it

 Yeah cuz I agree that a man should pay

 You're supposed to

(4:49:43) circle if you agree not if you disagree Okay Well I agree that a man should pay for the first date

 Well you should have

(4:49:49) circled it

 Okay Well I'm telling you Thank you

 You're welcome

 Thanks Thanks babe

 You're welcome babe

 All right So

(4:49:57) All right Uh

 Oh my god

 So why should men pay on first dates well I feel like if a

(4:50:02) man cannot buy you a drink he cannot buy you a house And the whole point of a relationship is you know to buy for men

(4:50:08) to buy houses for women

 Yes That's the whole point of a man And not just financially mentally physically

(4:50:15) emotionally

 What about condos are condos okay

 yeah He can buy whatever he want man What about he's is if he's going to

(4:50:21) buy on then he is allowed But I always believe I always believe in leaving the

(4:50:27) tip too you know just cuz it's like you know common courtesy Oh okay Uh

 just a tip

 Just a tip

 Just a

(4:50:34) tip

 Just a tip

 Uh question going back around the table Starting with you Uh would you show of

(4:50:41) hands who here wants to get married

(4:50:46) well I guess I should raise my hand

 Yeah you're That's a tricky topic

(4:50:53) You want men to buy you a house but you don't want to get married well of course because I think that I agree with

(4:51:01) marriage in like the holy matrimony type of way but marriage values nowaday

(4:51:08) modern marriage is just something that I cannot get behind Like you know like you

(4:51:13) being able man being able to lose

(4:51:19) everything behind a woman and her emotions because you know most marriages

(4:51:25) are initiated by a woman and a woman taking half

 divorce initiated

 Yeah

(4:51:31) Initiated uh most divorces are initiated by women And what I hear from that is a

(4:51:39) woman not being able to stick it out with her partner So in the courts you

(4:51:44) got to spend money to get divorced And then it's just like that's just a waste of money If that money could have went

(4:51:50) towards something in the relationship whether it be working on each other or working on something together

 you could

(4:51:56) just get a prenup and that fixes that Yeah Yeah Oh by the way guys uh TTS is $69 but for some reason the TTS isn't

(4:52:03) working So I'm going to be the TTS voice Keep Oh [ __ ] I really don't want to be the TTS voice here but uh laying correct

(4:52:33) table though uh I guess besides you since you don't on on the fence about marriage but whatever

(4:53:27) wants it He really really really wants it

 Begging you for

 take your husband's last name

 No

 No

 No

 You shouldn't be

(4:53:33) getting married if you can't take your man's last name

 She's not the doctor Not on her own So I just think that it's

(4:53:38) just because you know

 you go girl Okay Have you taken his name

 you've not taken your husband's last name

 I'm I'm

(4:53:44) actually I'm in kind of in the process right now

 Did he pay the for all the first dates though all the dates He pays

(4:53:50) for the dates Does he does he u pay for the the housing and stuff and

 well I

(4:53:56) bought I bought the house prior to knowing him which is actually why I haven't taken his last name yet cuz it's

(4:54:02) a pain in the ass to change all that But uh will you take your husband's last name

 yes

 So no But you said you're fine

(4:54:09) with the guys not paying for dates right you

 Yeah

 Okay So nothing to really pick

(4:54:14) apart there You won't take your husband's last name You won't take your husband's last name depends on

 why

(4:54:21) Here's what I'm curious about You guys just want traditional benefits when it suits you but in any metric by which

(4:54:30) tradition doesn't benefit you or suit you in some way you reject that component of tradition

 I feel like it's

(4:54:36) a conversation What's the conversation wait wait let me ask you a question Let's say there was a guy who he's not

(4:54:43) like the most amazing guy ever but like you like him you know you're in the middle

(4:54:49) whatever So you're attractive enough attracted enough to him to go on a date with him

(4:54:54) Mhm

 But he says to you before the date I want to have a conversation about who's

(4:55:00) going to pay

 on the date And he's going to he's going to want want to have as

(4:55:06) many conversations as you would want to have on that related Sorry [ __ ] brain fart

(4:55:14) He'd want to have as many conversations as you would want to have about the last name thing

 Okay

 Yeah

 I wouldn't go on a

(4:55:21) date with him because like why is he already asking about paying like if he didn't have the money I can pay Oh why

(4:55:26) is he considering marrying you when

 the first date

 you were already asking questions about taking his last name

 i

(4:55:34) wasn't asking though

 You said there would be a conversation

 I feel like like we were dating after the first date like

(4:55:39) you know years

 you have you've been dating for like 2 years You guys are

(4:55:44) engaged and it's he's like hey by the way you're taking my last name right

 see that like why would you by the way

(4:55:50) you're taking my last name What does it mean to take your last name like do you change on your property you change

 or

(4:55:55) like what does it mean

 you change your last name to his last name and your kids have his last name

 But I have my mom and

(4:56:02) my dad last name So

 you have a hyphenated last name

 No I have two last names

 It's like it's it's lat It's like

(4:56:07) Latina

 a Spanish thing

 Okay Well he's American

 or he's from [ __ ] Toronto or

(4:56:14) however the [ __ ] they do this [ __ ] in Canada In Canada though he's he's based as [ __ ] He's paying for all your dates

(4:56:20) and [ __ ] He's like "Listen Leah or whatever your not only fans name is."

(4:56:26) Listen

 it's just like a short name My name is It's very similar to that

(4:56:31) Cool He's like wants you to take his last name You taking his last name

 i mean like if it's a big deal to him

(4:56:38) maybe Cuz he seems like

 maybe

 Yeah

 You don't need to be with a man and you're not taking his last name cuz it's just

(4:56:45) taking a last name is just a part of the commitment If you can't do that which is so basic you don't need to be in a

(4:56:51) relationship with this person

 Then I guess I wouldn't because I don't know It's just like to me it's like why does it mean so much to you you know what I

(4:56:57) mean like to me my last name

 Why does it mean so much to you that guys pay for first dates

 it doesn't like it

 But you

(4:57:02) it does because you wouldn't be dating him if he didn't pay for the date

 No He didn't pay if he was asking already like

(4:57:08) "Oh who's going to pay for the first date?" Like why are you concerned about that you know what I mean

 because he wants to go 50/50

 Okay

(4:57:15) If he's really hot like maybe I would but

 No he's like average attractiveness or whatever

 Yeah you can't have it both

(4:57:21) ways You got to pick a side

 Okay If it come down to like the perfect guy and he wants me to change my last name to his I

(4:57:26) would But

 do you think you're going to get the perfect guy

 i hope so That's how I would get married Otherwise I would just stay single

 Wait just to be clear

(4:57:33) wait hold on You're not going to settle unless you get a perfect guy

 i wouldn't

(4:57:38) settle First of all I don't believe in marriage thinking about divorce Like I won't get married thinking like "Oh this is not going to like be forever." Like I

(4:57:45) don't want to have kids with somebody that

 the perfect guy

 No the perfect guy Nobody's perfect But like you know what I mean the perfect person for me Like in

() 

(4:57:51) the sense of like oh he's not going to be mad if I don't want to change my last name If I want to change my last name

 Oh okay So the the perfect You're willing

(4:57:56) to change your name for the perfect guy but the perfect guy wouldn't want you to change your last name

 Oh it wouldn't be that big of a deal Like it would be like

(4:58:03) That's helpful

 I feel like it makes sense though because I wouldn't want to be with a person that it's so like pressed about that Yeah but it's an easy

(4:58:09) way to just avoid the question Well the perfect guy he wouldn't want me to do that But I would do it for the perfect guy but he wouldn't want me to do that

(4:58:16) Nobody's perfect I feel like you could have a person that is like oh uh like

(4:58:21) change your last name You know I give you so much money but like you have to change your last name Or you can have a person that doesn't have any money but

(4:58:26) like you do whatever Is that a person perfect or not i think nobody's perfect I'm just saying somebody that meets like all the boxes that I'm like looking for

(4:58:33) I'll come back to you Um you won't take the guy's last name Why is that

 oh I already told you Um so the reason is

(4:58:39) simply because we are the last of our name a thousand-year-old name and there's only two girls remaining My

(4:58:45) brothers died a few years ago So it would be something that I would want to talk to them about and maybe keep my

(4:58:52) last name so that if we have children they can carry on that history What

(4:58:57) I mean if if it was very important to the other person I would take it And you

(4:59:03) know if my if it wasn't so important about my history of my name then

 I wouldn't even

(4:59:11) ask them to consider it I would just take their name That would be fine with me you know I'm I'm a lot more

(4:59:16) traditional um than the porn

 Yeah minus the corn Um

(4:59:23) yeah I'm very uh traditional I mean I'm voyeristic Doesn't mean I can't be voyeristic I can be a freak and still be

(4:59:30) traditional Can I not can I not

 Brian

 no you can't You can't be showing your

(4:59:37) butthole on the internet and also

 be traditional I can I can It's my life I can do what I

() 

(4:59:44) want

 I'm a white man but I'm also a black man

 Exactly From the waist down

(4:59:50) Exactly And I'm a white girl with straight hair

(4:59:56) and I'm flatchested But that's only because I identify with that and I would be offended if somebody said otherwise

(5:00:02) As a black man

 I feel that I can have personal um tra I can have traditional

(5:00:08) ways for myself while doing something professionally for my business So my business isn't it's an extension of

(5:00:15) myself but it doesn't define me completely So if I choose to be traditional in a relationship that's my

(5:00:22) right It's like I'm a Christian but I reject the Trinity and I don't actually believe in Jesus That that wouldn't it

(5:00:29) wouldn't make sense

 Gnostic or something I don't know

 You wouldn't Well you wouldn't be No What no

 You wouldn't be a

(5:00:35) Christian And in this way if you're a sex worker you cannot claim traditional

(5:00:41) Like yeah you could cook you can clean you can do all this other stuff

 but you're not traditional

 Claim it I just

(5:00:48) said it I said it So I just claimed it Okay Oh I'm a billionaire I must be a billionaire

 What about conservative

(5:00:55) instead of traditional like I feel like we have like conser uh what's it called uh conservative views Like I feel like

(5:01:01) having sex Yeah

 Conservative You're conservative

 No I'm not conservative But I have conservative like thoughts that I

(5:01:07) have Like you know like it's the way I was raised It's like my grandma's Christian Like my I don't know

 How were you wait how were you raised what do you

(5:01:12) mean

 like I was literally like I've never had sex Like literally Yeah

 Like literally Yeah

 Like literally Wait you

(5:01:18) lied about your name You lied about your age

 I didn't lie about my name My name is just like short

 Wait hold on So okay

(5:01:24) OF girl lied about her age Tattoos

(5:01:30) and piercings too Piercings

 Yeah

 Where nipples

 Yeah But

(5:01:36) wait whoa wait wait wait Hold on Hold on Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa

 whoa Wait No

(5:01:44) It's again it's logically possible that a woman could have nipple piercings and

(5:01:49) be a virgin I ain't taking that bet bro I It's

(5:01:55) possible

 I got a belly button piercing when I was 12 in Cuba and then I took it off and I got it again when I was like

(5:02:00) 18 No no like this year

 I'm just nipple piercings and virgin It's possible

(5:02:09) I guess but it's really not probable Yeah

 Well that's the duality of man

 It's

(5:02:15) the duality

 I got my tongue pierced when I was 14

 Did you take it off

 the [ __ ]

(5:02:20) are they doing at 14

 Carnal knowledge

 No By the way did you guys see

(5:05:16) that video of that Karen who there were ducks mating

(5:05:22) and she jumped into it was in Lake Arrowhead and she jumped into the body of water because she thought that the I

(5:05:29) mean maybe apparently ducks they're the only one of the few species

(5:05:34) of bird with a penis

 It's shaped like a corkcrew too And

(5:05:40) apparently ducks they do

(5:05:46) grape

 Yes

 ducks can grape

 and do I've seen

 because of their penis

 And so she

(5:05:53) apparently she thinks she saw a duck on duck grape

 right

 and so she was stopping

(5:05:59) the duck grape Oh

 do you think humans should intervene

(5:06:07) for non-consensual animal

 well I am not kidding I took a 911 call about that

(5:06:12) once

 Really

 turkeys yes Somebody actually called 911 about that about the

(5:06:18) turkeys graped yes

 Holy [ __ ]

 Turkey and turkey

 Do you have to euthanize a turkey that or a duck that

(5:06:49) is a a grapist duck

 oh my god

 We might as well go deep diving in the deep blue

(5:06:54) sea and stop those sea animals from raping each other too then Try to use

(5:06:59) raping each other too What the hell are we supposed to do about animals graping each other

 Didn't But it sounds hilarious She jumped She was like trying to stop

(5:07:15) it and I was

 at first I was like "That's kind of crazy." But then I was like

 I wouldn't jump in the water

 but I might

(5:07:21) tell the duck to knock it off like when I was like 5 years old

 I might at least be like "Hey guy relax."

 We had like 20

(5:07:28) different

 But I'm not going to like get She got She was wearing full clothes and jumped in the water

 That's wild

 And like

(5:07:35) try to stop it

 Yeah

 Like I would say something

 How did she even know that she said no

 you would call 911

 No How does a

(5:07:42) woman know that

 i would just you know I'd probably be like "Hey not that." Like what was her plan

 watch for a few

(5:07:47) seconds and then

 Did she hear the duck like English did she plan on like physically pulling them apart and by

(5:07:54) what means not really a crazy thing to do

 how do you know

 you have to go like like one quack is like yes and like two

(5:11:31) quacks is no

 Quack once if you need help Yeah

(5:11:37) All right Uh we're going to move to here Let's do men are more superficial than

(5:11:43) uh don't maybe if there's time I'll come back to some of these Uh let's see Men

(5:11:48) care more about looks than women do Leah you think that's the case jade you agree

(5:11:56) why is that Leah

 i feel like because women usually care more about their appearance because of men Like we're

(5:12:02) told to do so Like you know the whole

 Oh I meant it more so from in a partner in a boyfriend

 Like a

() 

(5:12:10) partner would care more about

 women Women care more about looks than than men care about looks in terms of

(5:12:17) themselves

 No they

 their partner Oh

(5:12:23) men care more But women settle a lot I feel like you

(5:12:29) see a lot of Yeah I see a lot of like really hot women with like mid men because of different reasons

 Different

(5:12:34) reasons Yeah but I think that's because you guys overrate yourselves

 I didn't

 Oh not you

(5:12:41) Oh thanks

 But well who then

 he was He gave me the

 I mean I already I already

(5:12:48) when you asked me to rate you guys it was kind of Yeah it

 was fun

 He don't

(5:12:53) like black women for real

 What are you talking about i only date black women Yeah sure If that's so true

 that I only

(5:12:58) date black women Honestly you're a little too um

 light-skinned Is that what you're

(5:13:04) about to say

 a little too lightkinned

 I ain't never heard that before

 You're not

(5:13:09) I like them You like dark chocolate That's what you like You like them dark

 Heart of Africa

(5:13:16) You like that 78% cacao

 you said I ain't part of Africa

 The heart of Africa Like

(5:13:22) like Nigeria

 Would you date him what likear

 like Congo

 Quatvar

 I don't know

(5:13:30) They're really dark there

 Yes Whatever that is Yes

 Oh like

 the ivory covy Yeah

(5:13:36) I just never heard it pronounced right Oh

 that's how white I am

 Okay

(5:13:43) I mean my argument here is like of the things that women care about when it comes to looks those things tend to be

(5:13:51) mostly out of men's control Whereas the things that men care about there are some things that men care about when it

(5:13:57) comes to looks in women that are out of women's control but a lot more of it is

(5:14:03) in women's control whereas like Okay if you look at height

 men can't do anything about their height

 Actually you could

(5:14:09) Well okay Yeah there's I'm I'm like sort of excluding uh surgical surgical proced cuz like a

(5:14:17) woman

 women can't grow the size of their breasts but they can get plastic surgery

(5:14:22) But I wouldn't

 consider that like that is getting surgical intervention so men

(5:14:28) can get the height

 thing But I that's I don't know Uh I wouldn't factor that in

(5:14:34) here So

 wait why no if you're factoring but it's about what they can't change But they can change it

 Okay Yes

(5:14:40) technically they can change it

 but it's absent s like things that they can't

(5:14:46) change absent surgery

 What about like Wait Okay What about like a nose or anything so what could a man like tell a

(5:14:52) woman to change about themselves that wouldn't be through surgery if you know what I mean

 their weight

(5:14:58) Weight

 Okay But that's that's kind of valid Like

 hygiene

 cuz somebody could

(5:15:04) gain weight and you be like "Okay can you like lose a little bit of weight cuz whatever."

 Sure

 I say that to myself all

(5:15:09) the time

 I look myself deep in the eyes in my mirror I just You fat piece of

(5:15:16) [ __ ] crunches

 Uh okay But like okay there's height penis size hair

(5:15:23) You could do all of that stuff Circumcision You could change your like make your penis bigger There's surgery for that

 No

(5:15:30) but I'm saying without surgery

 Okay

 Men can't change their height If a man is balding not not much that he can do

(5:15:40) to change that

 without surgery Like there's there's like the drugs I guess and then

(5:15:46) there's hair transplants but that would be surgery

 Uh-huh So what else can you change about women cuz it's just the weight then

 Yeah Wait And she could I

(5:15:54) mean ass You can you can build an ass in the gym

 You can grow that ass

 You can

(5:16:01) grow that ass in the gym

 You can grow that ass

 Like if a girl is short she can

(5:16:06) wear heels if she's like if she's if she's self-conscious about her look she could put more makeup

(5:16:12) on I don't know like

 bow show

 You know there's a lot of things that women can do to be

 That's so true

 like

(5:16:18) non-surgical things to improve their look versus guys What do you guys have like wardrobe

 and you can grow a little

(5:16:24) beard or like you know get some of that scruff going You're concerned about your

(5:16:29) face

 There's not a lot

 Yeah eye angle is just

 I think men women are way more superficial just because a man is going

(5:16:37) to I mean if a man like a woman he ain't going to be too picky about it as long as that woman likes him but a woman is

(5:16:43) going to be picky about a man that likes her because you know a woman thinks you know she could have this and that and

(5:16:50) this and that So that is very superficial of a woman

 Yeah

(5:16:55) Eight Yeah I mean my whole argument just stems from of the things the like the really

(5:17:01) important things that men and women care about the the things that women really care about men really can't

(5:17:09) change absent surgery height penis size hair

 and then I guess like uh do you

(5:17:16) guys have a preference for cut versus uncut

 what

 circumcised

 oh

 do you guys

(5:17:21) care about that

 I prefer yeah I prefer cut but just because it looks better that turtleneck I don't know what to do

(5:17:27) with the skin I'm like I don't know what you roll it back

 But I don't really care

(5:17:32) though I really don't I do have a preference

 I feel like men like men like

(5:17:39) to have women that look pretty Oh god here we go Um I have a

 Yeah you

(5:17:47) agree too huh

 like my mom's current boyfriend he divorced his wife because

(5:17:53) like whatever their own reasons but she wouldn't dress up she wouldn't like really take care of herself and my mom does and she's like this person like he

(5:17:59) wants to be with and like whatever right my point is just that like I feel like men care about those things that the way their woman looks you know

 Oh the other

(5:18:06) thing the other thing I was thinking about I think it's harder for men to be good-looking than it is for women to be

(5:18:12) good-looking

 Mm- I don't think so

 I think so

 But wait you just said earlier you just said that you see all these

(5:18:19) really good-looking girls with average dudes So is it that they're just passing

(5:18:24) over like this abundance of really good-looking men

 i think you're right Actually there's more hot girls Waited

(5:18:31) but there the chance is the same If I have a brother like we have 50/50 Like if I'm prettier than you that's I don't

(5:18:36) know what to tell you

 Wait what do you mean if what about your brother

 i'm just saying no I'm saying like you said

 you saying your brother's ugly

 i don't know

(5:18:42) That's really rude

 I don't think he's ugly But like

 you do have a brother though

 I do

 Does he know you have Only Fans

 no he doesn't He don't even speak

(5:18:48) English

 How old is he what do you mean [ __ ] Are you saying

 Spanish people

(5:18:53) don't know how to use the internet that's kind of racist Why would you look up why would he look up his

(5:18:59) doing things on They don't have that would be insane

 I know it's really expensive to like have internet people that are

 wait your bros in Cuba

 Yeah my

(5:19:05) family's in Cuba except for my mom my like little sister

 Wait why didn't Why your How old's your bro how old's your

(5:19:11) brother

 i don't even know He's like

 You don't know your brother

 14 years older than me

 He's 14 years older And then I

(5:19:17) have like 14 year old younger siblings than me too Like three

 two technically in case somebody's watching this

 My dad

(5:19:24) has like a sidewoman with the little kid My dad likes young

(5:19:30) hopefully No

 Go off queen

 Pop off

 What in a period what in the period pool are

(5:19:36) you talking about

 the what

 exactly he's blocked too Girl the what pool

(5:19:43) okay

 Wait So hold on Um well I think if for example though if you look at

(5:19:49) aspirational body types so if you look at superhero movies you look at the

(5:19:54) women who are cast as female superheroes the men who are cast as male superheroes the male superhero body type is

() 

(5:20:04) like you need to basically take the treat the gym as a part-time job

(5:20:10) probably need to be on some sort of steroids like most these guys like uh Hugh Jackman and then who's the

(5:20:19) guy who plays Thor

 uh Chris Hemsworth I'm pretty sure he's on

 he's on gear

(5:20:26) They're ripped Yeah

 Like these guys are taking performance-enhancing drugs

(5:20:33) to achieve

 Scarlet Johans Scarjo What who's the girl who plays Wonder Woman what's her name the

 Galado

(5:20:41) Like that body type They're just like "No

 they do some Pilates or some shit." She literally was pregnant when she

(5:20:46) filmed like the first one

 Okay guys but their body is really hot Like

 I'm not I'm not saying that like they're just

(5:20:53) lazy slobs Surely some work goes into it but the physique of the female superhero

(5:20:59) as depicted in Hollywood movies is it's achievable by more women than if

(5:21:07) compared to the male body type depicted in Hollywood films is less achievable

 I

(5:21:13) don't agree It's easier for a man to get back in shape and to achieve his peak

(5:21:18) physical form easier than it is for a woman because scientifically it's we lose fat the older we get the slower we

(5:21:26) lose fat So a woman being in peak physical form is way less hard is harder

(5:21:31) than a man being in his peak physical form because it's easy for a man to drop that weight

(5:21:37) Uh okay So you're arguing that men lose fat easier is that

 yeah it's easier for

(5:21:43) a man to be in shape Like look at a man that is in his 50s versus a woman that is in his 50s A woman has to try really

(5:21:49) really hard to keep her shape All a man has to do is really just take care of his body It is simple for men You know

(5:21:55) they always you know it's easy for a man to get back in shape in my opinion

 Well I'm talking about Well now you're you're

(5:22:00) shifting the goalpost to being in shape I'm talking about aspirational body types Correct

 So if we're talking about

(5:22:06) because women like to argue oh the female beauty standard it's so hard blah blah blah But if you actually look at

(5:22:11) like physique so body

 move face is kind of being removed here Although even I

(5:22:17) can make some arguments that uh reaching like having the ideal male facial

(5:22:23) structure whatever like that's actually like way fewer men fall into like ideal

(5:22:28) male facial facial structure than like do women fall into ideal or attractive female facial structure But when it

(5:22:35) comes to uh what was the word I used uh aspirational that aspirational physiques

(5:22:41) and body types You look at male superheroes that's way less men have that physique than do women have like

(5:22:48) the Galado physique Like you could just kind of diet and do a couple Pilates

(5:22:54) classes

 Okay But don't a lot of superhero wear like like a muscle suit underneath to make their muscles bigger

(5:23:00) But also you paying attention to an unrealistic movie character Those men are still tone My bad In your opinion

(5:23:07) what would we have to do to look like Scarlett Johansson or what's her name um he said diet and do pilateses

 Do you

(5:23:12) think that would be enough for me i think

 you could probably you could probably tone up a little bit You know

(5:23:18) you do like I run

 Yeah but you could do like do some Pilates

(5:23:24) Sorry But like it's really like you know mostly body fat

 I feel like the world is

(5:23:30) hard for both of us both genders That's my point

 Sure I agree I'm just talking

(5:23:35) about this specific thing We have a chat here Women spend way more money and time like

(5:23:43) on their physique to look that way than men do

 Well women can get naturally

(5:23:50) aren't going to like

 I think you guys focus more on artificial improvements

(5:23:56) And if we exclude artificial improvements men can get their shapes naturally Women cannot You know no

(5:24:01) matter you can't avoid your genetics If you if you built you know like a square you know that ass could do you know so

(5:24:07) much You can only grow so much ass in the gym before you have to buy one But men can grow they shape naturally I

(5:24:13) don't see no man out here getting plastic surgery which is why it's easier for a man to get the body type that is

(5:24:18) inspired in Hollywood than a woman is

 I have hip dips The only way I'm going to get like a fat ass is like putting fat

(5:24:24) here like through a BBL or something right have you tried maybe squats or

 I do that on life but also

 it'll muscle up

(5:24:32) but you ain't going to be no fat ass Psychopathic We have psychopathic gaming

(5:24:37) It may be small but a Jolly Rancher still hurts like hell Coming at 100 miles per hour

 He's talking about PP

(5:24:44) size

 Oh my god

 Jolly Rancher is like

 I don't know

 I know That's right It ain't about the size of the boat It's about

(5:24:51) the motion in the ocean

 This guy's got a huge Jolly Rancher Okay that's great Um

(5:24:56) thank you psychopathic All right moving on to the next thing Uh a woman's career money status makes her more attractive

(5:25:03) to men Karen you don't agree You don't agree Oh this Karen my bad

 Uh Leah you

() 

(5:25:10) think a woman's career money status makes her more attractive to men uh you say no Jade And you say you think

(5:25:18) yes a woman's career money status makes her more attractive to men

(5:25:24) Uh Karen you do

 to a degree

 You agree with that Uh why is that for those of

(5:25:30) you who agree with the statement

 because I think guys like chicks that have their [ __ ] together to a degree you know i

(5:25:37) mean it's like when you start dating somebody do you want somebody that has maybe established and she's got a career

(5:25:44) and she's got a you know good job or do you want someone well I just got off section 8 and you know I just I'm good

(5:25:52) looking at Del Tacos hiring Well I I don't think we we necessarily

(5:25:59) men don't necessarily want somebody who's at some deficit or

(5:26:04) her life is in shambles or something But the difference between a woman who

(5:26:12) I don't know makes $50,000 a year working like a reasonable job or she's not super busy like she's a secretary or

(5:26:19) something versus a like highowered female attorney who's making $300,000 an

(5:26:26) hour or sorry

 a year Excuse me I misspoke She's making $300,000 a year I

(5:26:32) don't think the attraction differential between secretary who makes $50,000 an hour

(5:26:38) versus attorney who makes $300,000 a year Wait did I say hour

 did I say hour at the

(5:26:46) hour 50,000 an hour

 50,000 a year versus $300,000 a year Excuse me

 I don't think

(5:26:53) like men are going to be like "Wow she's way more attractive." Correct because

(5:27:00) if your life is in [ __ ] shambles and you're a mess and you're homeless and like on the first date you're going to

(5:27:06) be asking to live at my place

 versus dating the attorney I could see the benefits of dating an attorney who's got

(5:27:12) her [ __ ] kind of figured out that I can understand But if it's

(5:27:18) between like a girl she's got her own she's got a place but she makes 50k a year versus 300 Yeah it's not a huge I

(5:27:25) don't care I disagree with that statement because a woman's success has

(5:27:32) nothing to do with the way a man is attracted to her because you can have it all figured out But if you a woman that

(5:27:38) can't submit if you a woman that cannot satisfy your man if you a woman that cannot be you know help to your man and

(5:27:45) you know depend on your man like a woman should then that's just unattractive to a man in the first place You know I

(5:27:52) think that a woman who knows she needs a man and appreciates a man that's what's most important to a man not this her

(5:27:59) status you know in income or her success when it comes to her career

 I feel like

(5:28:04) I agree because Oh I disagree with her I don't even know But I was saying like a woman that has more things going on is

(5:28:11) more interesting to a guy I don't think like the level of attraction would matter because what she said if a man is going to be attracted to you it doesn't

(5:28:16) matter what you do But like if you have a woman that has a lot to I don't know show like to bring to the table wouldn't

(5:28:23) you be like kind of more like higher up in the pool

 what do you mean by bring to the table

 that's what guys say all the

(5:28:28) time Like what do you bring to the table i bring like this much money I bring this

 It's not when we're talking about what they bring to the table It's not

(5:28:34) career It's not money It's not status Yeah Is it like personality can you make this man laugh can you make this man

(5:28:40) confide in you can you take care of this man mentally it's not just about money And that's what people often overlook

(5:28:46) because they always think it's money money money When you know money is the least of a motherfucker's problems a

(5:28:51) motherfucker's worries It should be about how both of these people can take care of each other

 Not money but like

(5:28:57) education or hobbies or like I don't know something a book that you read that gives you a lot

 What's your hobby what's your hobby

 i game

 Huh

 i'm a gamer

 She's

(5:29:05) a gamer

 And she also

 I also read mangas Post her butthole on the internet I

 and

(5:29:11) do I do but not in I mean yeah

 I mean yeah

(5:29:16) there

 no push back anybody else any push back on this so my position is men don't

(5:29:22) care about women's career money status they don't

 like it doesn't make it doesn't make her more attractive

(5:29:29) I'm sorry I I definitely think they do especially when you get into higher levels of education or class or wealth

(5:29:37) um who you marry is going to be someone who reflects your status and you want to have status to create a new status for

(5:29:44) your family and for your children So when you get into upper class lifestyle you're

 what percentage of people is that

(5:29:51) yeah we're going to Sorry

 What well what percentage of people is that

 i mean it's

(5:29:56) Well I mean if I'm say when I say when I say upper class um upper class maybe would be somebody who's making more than

(5:30:03) like 500 to 700,000 a year They're not going to go after the girl who makes 50,000 I mean they might

 Let's talk

(5:30:10) about the 99%

 No but wait wait wait Cuz see that's where she going wrong at I don't think it's about what this woman

(5:30:16) makes You know this woman not being able to take care of herself is you know what

(5:30:21) a man is supposed to worry about in the first place So making it about the money is where people go wrong at Because in a

(5:30:29) relationship you you want somebody to take care of I mean that's just natural As a man you want to feel needed A

(5:30:35) marriage is a business though

 Correct It is a business But you saying that a

(5:30:40) woman a man cares more about her her status quo No a man cares about this

(5:30:46) woman reflecting his discipline This woman reflecting his his values This woman reflecting his you know control

(5:30:53) and the type of control he has over her It's not just about the money and it's not just about the status quo Cuz he can

(5:30:58) build this woman up to be classy and you know carry herself with class And if if that money is hers too then the money

(5:31:06) don't matter But the values and the respect and the discipline matters most right no I I agree with that part But I

(5:31:12) do think that people marry within their class and that can't be denied

 Take like take the opposite of that Like does it

(5:31:18) matter for a guy like does it make a guy more attractive when he

(5:31:24) has makes a lot of money and all of that yes I also feel like sorry

(5:31:31) I think I got her off

 like Tiffany Hattish has that expression it's so great she's like you're not going to beat your mil meet your millionaire

(5:31:37) wearing your $22 sheen dress

 you know I also feel like realistically

(5:31:44) don't people look down on people that are a little bit dumb or like act a little bit like bimbo type of energy it's my favorite type of person

 why

(5:31:51) because you can control them or what

 no then why do you like that

 it's just there's something nice about somebody who's simple you Like somebody's a

(5:31:58) little too smart That's like all these people who are super smart are all very anxious and [ __ ]

 That's true

 True

 People

(5:32:06) can be smart and you

 There is something attractive about someone who's simple

 or

(5:32:11) stupid Is that what you mean

 why does that say But I don't want to be like I don't need to have like deep

(5:32:16) philosophical conversations with my girlfriend

 Oh then that just makes you boring And if you want to be with a boring [ __ ] then that's cool That'sor

(5:32:23) preference

 Boring's good I like boring But that's you But I'm just saying like I like simple

 I don't want to be like

(5:32:29) but then it it also takes this other angle of being in a contentious like always arguing and [ __ ]

(5:32:36) I think people

 I don't want to be challenged

 I think people confuse arguing for having a you know a

(5:32:43) conversation It's okay to state your points and not take it personal It's not an argument if you know you're having a

(5:32:49) conversation and going back and forth If you're looking at it like an argument then maybe you need to change your perspective

 Conversation earlier

 We were

(5:32:56) Or was that an argument

 we were having a conversation In my opinion we were having a conversation

 Are you enjoying the conversation though i love the

(5:33:03) conversation

 No that was

 I love hearing I love hearing everybody's point of view And one thing about conversation is you

(5:33:09) can't take off our Latina friends

 You can't take nothing personal Go ahead

 You kind of being you you were kind of being rude to our cub Cuban friend

 Of course I

(5:33:17) know We made a we besties now Are you guys

 Cuz we know that conversation it shouldn't be taken personally

 Why did

(5:33:23) you do that

 because I'm sweating

 Oh I thought you were like like when you touched her you were like rubbing it off

(5:33:29) on you like

 he's trying to be shaved He's trying to be shaved

 No no no Like I'm just looking out for you cuz we're

(5:33:35) homies and she was like doing some weird

 said we homies

 She was being said we homies

(5:33:41) You said it earlier

 I didn't say that Yeah you said we were homies You said you said we homies

 Rewind

(5:33:47) Rewind

 All right we have two chats here We have psychopathic gaming Brian slowly falling in love with his future wife in

(5:33:53) chair 2

 I can see it

 Love myself a strong independent queen

 Are we invited

(5:33:59) to the wedding

 base Thor Uh no Okay Base Thor Chair 2 claims

(5:34:04) she's on par with Oh hold on Base Thor Thank you Chair 2 claims she's on par

(5:34:10) with Megan Fox Is it going to Man it's taking forever Hold on

(5:34:15) I don't want to start reading it until uh Damn what the [ __ ] agrees that women

(5:34:21) lie more than men saying women lie to themselves all the time while claiming she's a 10 out of 10 Can't make this up What a

 stupidasso

(5:34:28) Stupidasso

 Oh

 stupid

 Hey I'm here to represent the 304 community too Shout

(5:34:34) out to all my 304s out there Y'all see what I'm doing holl at me

 Holler at your

(5:34:39) girl Okay

 they can't handle this real talk Wait where were we were uh was it career

(5:34:46) where were we

 i think we were just talking about like career and like Yeah And how much

(5:34:56) oh yeah You were talking about I think No we were Is that you

 what were we talking about

(5:35:02) sorry About business and relationships Yeah The last thing you were talking about was how status quo and you you

(5:35:09) having to be on the same status with the partner that you have

 Yeah I I really do believe that I've watched lots of young

(5:35:15) people date people all you know school year long and at the end of the semester

(5:35:21) they go marry somebody within their class So I mean like what she said you you're not going to meet a millionaire

(5:35:27) in your sheen dress

 You also like are most likely to meet someone like

 in the same area Yeah Yeah Like with your golf

(5:35:34) So you're spending time in the same Yeah So you're in a space where you're around people who have similar um ideals and

() 

(5:35:40) standards for their lives

 I also feel like it's good to bring your own thing so you have like your security of like

(5:35:46) if this person wanted to divorce you or whatever right you don't just have nothing to fall on You know what I mean

(5:35:51) correct You got to bring your own value to the table You can't demand value and not be able to bring it

 Exactly I That's

(5:35:56) why like I want to make my own money I want to come into a relationship with my own money where like I'm demanding like you've had this much money because I

(5:36:02) have that You know what I mean so do we think that Jeff Bezos just married um Lauren Sanchez and she's on

(5:36:09) the same level as him well that's an outlier because he's a he's a billionaire and there's so few

(5:36:15) billionaires So I don't think that's um he's such a rare phenomenon that their

(5:36:22) relationship but yes within their class yes she was rubbing elbows with all the same people that he knew That's how she

(5:36:28) met him in the first place Um she's been married a few times and all of them were extremely wealthy Big L That's a fat L

(5:36:35) for I think that's No no For for Bezos like here's the richest man in one of

(5:36:41) the richest men in the world And it's like

 like multi- You said multiple

(5:36:46) divorces

 She's been divorced multiple times

 Yeah I think she's

 Yeah I know who she is but like single like she's a mom

(5:36:53) single mom whatever What has she done to her face she was so

(5:36:59) pretty

 You know what I think it is maybe like he used to deal with her back in the day or something

 Yeah he had a thing

(5:37:05) for her or something

 Had a thing for her back in the day You know maybe it's like she does

(5:37:11) I don't even want to

 She was on tele Some of these guys are sing for like some good

 I don't know She maybe she's

(5:37:18) into some weird [ __ ]

 Okay Jack

 and he's into some weird [ __ ] and they just align on the weird [ __ ]

 Do you know what my

(5:37:25) dad would say my dad would say she must have a hell of a snapper Oh I just got I

(5:37:30) have a real life sample from here I don't know if I can

(5:38:14) Bugs boys Also drop us a follow Okay thank you

 Hey

 thank you Thank you Whatever podcast

 what were you saying

 i

(5:38:19) was just say like why did John Gravy pop up with like his current girlfriend but not with like Chloe like the girl right

(5:38:25) why because I'm thinking he thinks that Ari is kind of more worth it or something Not my opinion but you know

(5:38:31) what I'm saying right

 more followers more fans

 more

 more fame

 I mean I'm friends with

 I don't think we should

(5:38:37) look to like rappers for anything about it

 Well yeah I I mean I'm friends with

(5:38:42) Chloe and I know that she's like really popular on social media and um

(5:38:48) successful in her career but I know that like she was just put off that like

 I do

(5:38:55) think that maybe um there was like some thing around that like everyone thought

(5:39:00) it was kind of staged at first like that they were like they were just doing it as like a marketing thing like to boost

(5:39:06) each other up but and but they were actually dating and it's weird that like he was telling Chloe when they were together like she doesn't

(5:39:14) like please don't post me like don't say things and she was like okay and then

(5:39:19) now he's just like his whole entire like Instagram is like all about Ari So I

(5:39:24) understand like her frustration there but it's interesting to see that perspective of like maybe he thought

(5:39:30) that she brought more to the table and then Chloe might have but and like

(5:39:36) that's why he went public with Ari and not with Kloe

(5:39:41) Yeah I don't know It's a question for Young Gravy True Cool Uh all right Well moving on Um

(5:39:50) h wait hold on No [ __ ] that I'm not moving on Look I think if you look at a male attorney well I I'd agree that he's

(5:39:58) going to be moving in a certain circle Maybe there's some [ __ ] parillegals and [ __ ] He's just smashing running through whatever it is Thank you and you

(5:40:06) know maybe he ends up you know with another attorney whatever it may be he's

(5:40:11) way more likely to be willing to date a woman who's a barista than the reverse So a female attorney I think is very

(5:40:18) unlikely to want to date a male barista right

 good talk That was great Thank you

(5:40:24) guys All right we have uh let's see why don't we do uh women are oppressed in

(5:40:30) the USA to which we have Anna Is it Ann or Anna

 yes Anna

(5:40:37) Anna

 Anna Fumi

 You said you agree women are oppressed in the USA Does anybody

() 

(5:40:42) else agree with that or

 No

 Okay Just you Why is that

 i don't know I don't even remember writing that So

 you just women

(5:40:50) is is that the exact question

 women are oppressed in the USA To which you said you agree

 Why is that

 i don't know I

(5:40:56) think I made that one up I don't really care either way I'm sorry I mean yes women are uh in some ways women do have

(5:41:04) you know they can be oppressed so yes anyone can be oppressed so therefore yeah

 welcome

(5:41:11) how how though how are women oppressed oh I don't know

 just like

 you don't know just things that I'm sorry I'm tired let

(5:41:18) me think okay

 you have that pound that [ __ ]

 I can't it makes it gives me heartburn but um I don't know there are

(5:41:24) situations where people have been you know have some of it

 I had a little bit I don't drink a lot of caffeine to to be

(5:41:30) honest Um but uh yeah situations where women aren't believed in situations

(5:41:36) which it's a it's believed in situations of you know issues like that But that's

(5:41:41) such a let's talk about something more positive that's so depressing

 I feel like you know what I mean showed that

(5:41:47) women are going to be believed far more than men Maybe it did maybe to

 and plus you guys

(5:41:54) have the constitution You have the first amendment You can speak your mind America

 you are not oppressed Is the

(5:42:00) greatest country in the world

 The United Kingdom does not have a constitution Which makes America the greatest country

(5:42:06) in the world Women are not oppressed in America We It's so easy being a girl nowadays If you struggling as a girl

(5:42:12) that's your fault

 Who makes the rules though like

 well wait Hold on before we get into that

 Who

 if

 we say where they

(5:42:22) like if we believe women wouldn't that mean to disbelieve men

(5:42:29) i'm so tired I'm going to oppress you right now if you keep asking me questions Um I think that yes you should I think

(5:42:37) the whole idea of uh believe the victim or believe the person who says it and then weed it out like what you said

(5:42:43) earlier about the burden of proof and etc etc So you can't just believe I mean

(5:42:49) you can't believe everything but at the same time I do think that there's been more situations where women and young

(5:42:55) girls have not been believed There was a show called um Unbelievable on Netflix and it was really good and it was based

(5:43:01) on a true story where they told her she was lying until they found her driver's license um in the guy's house So

 um and

(5:43:09) she like they had to give her all this money but it was all because they chose not to believe her just off of how she

(5:43:16) was her demeanor what she was saying They didn't feel like she was sad enough So I mean yes there is some oppression

(5:43:22) that can occur but men get oppressed too So I'm not saying it's a you know just women solely get oppressed There's a lot

(5:43:29) of men who go through a lot of physical and mental and emotional abuse at the hands of their spouses And people joke

(5:43:36) around you know there's so much like there's so much hate for a man saying

(5:43:41) "Hey somebody's abusing me and hurting me and treating me poorly." Everybody's like "Suck it up buttercup." You know

(5:43:46) and so it's like a lot of men experience similar oppression psychological oppression to be honest Yeah

 that is

(5:43:53) true But okay when it comes to the whole like believe all women thing unless the

(5:43:59) guy comes out and confesses that he did whatever is alleged to have been done

(5:44:06) I'm assuming most men are going to say I did not do that

 So if we say believe all

(5:44:12) women that that smuggles in disbelief

(5:44:18) men

 Yeah And it can it can mean that we have situations where people lie on it

(5:44:23) and that's that's terrible But it's better

 It happens a lot

 Yes But it's better

 as a call taker It happens a lot

(5:44:31) We shouldn't blame men for things that men never did to them But oh he ghosted

(5:44:37) me Oh he dumped me I

 Wait is your husband a law enforcement officer

 no

 No

(5:44:43) Okay Um but you're Can you speak more on that the whole you know as a 911

(5:44:48) operator

 Um I mean what's your experience with you're saying that a lot of these

 uh or I don't know if it's a

(5:44:55) lot but you've encountered a lot of false accusations

(5:45:00) Yes

 Um so

 what's your thoughts on that you know I've count encountered way more

(5:45:07) false accusations than I have It's a real call

 Really

 sad

 Yeah it's really

 a

() 

(5:45:14) waste of time I had one woman on the phone who um wow

 was afraid they had

(5:45:20) claimed that she was assaulted and she said it was a hobo did it to her in some

(5:45:26) alley when she was walking the dog and as it turned out she had an affair

 Um

(5:45:31) she was having an affair

 So that's a woman avoiding accountability

 So did you you dispatched some police officers to

(5:45:38) the scene

 oh yeah No out to her house and it was when the deputies did all their talking and figuring it out that

(5:45:45) she confessed and was like

 "Well okay no it didn't really happen." But I mean I I can remember asking her vividly

 What did

(5:45:53) his voice sound like did he have an accent what did he smell like what you know anything and she's like "I just

(5:45:59) blacked out I just blacked out I just blacked out."

 And

 And do you um like do

(5:46:07) the are you friendly with the police officers so like how did you

 like because I'm assuming you're not staying

(5:46:12) on the call the entire time They go out they investigate a bit Do you you talk to them sometimes after

 yeah we'll call

(5:46:18) sometimes if it's something that's really like kind of eaten at you I'll call them up and or I would call them up

(5:46:23) and say "Hey how did that end?" You know and then they'd say "Oh this happened or that happened." And

 but and so you

(5:46:30) you're And wait how long have you been doing

 i dispatched for about 15 years

(5:46:35) From what age to what age cuz you're 57 now right uh I started at 40

 40 and I

(5:46:41) did

 What were you doing before

 i worked in the family business

 Okay

 So at 40 you became a 911 operator Yeah

 Okay And then

(5:46:49) you did it for 15 years

 Mhm

 And so this was from uh

 this was like mid 2000

 Uh I

(5:46:55) did a 2007 I started

 2007 to to 2021

(5:47:01) 2021

 and I became

 But And you're still involved with uh

 I work at one of our headquarters

 but you're not actually

(5:47:07) doing the calls now Was that No I don't You're like administrative or Okay Gotcha

 And but so for that 15 years

 Mhm

(5:47:15) that you were a 911 operator

 you're saying that the majority of the calls

(5:47:21) you got were a woman was alleging that she had been raped as

 in calls in calls

(5:47:28) where women alleged they were assaulted there were more of the false calls than the real calls Yes

(5:47:35) But when you say because I know sometimes they differentiate this because I want to be charitable on this thing on this topic There's there's a

(5:47:43) difference between uh I think the term terminology is is it unfounded i don't

(5:47:49) know if that's the term versus false Like so I guess unfounded would be there's not enough uh like probable

(5:47:58) cause

 to determine like the police who are investigating there's like it's it

(5:48:03) could have happened but there's not enough evidence either based on her testimony

 or you know whatever

 well I

(5:48:11) guess what yeah I don't know

 I haven't do you know what I'm talking about

 kind of yeah honestly by the time they weed

(5:48:18) it out it's either usually when the when They're getting there and they're talking to the girl

(5:48:24) the girl will generally admit that she's making it up

 Oh they

 before it even gets

(5:48:30) to the point of like through the questioning because their stories change

(5:48:36) you know it's like they'll say one thing to this call taker and then

 one of the cops will get there and they'll say

(5:48:42) something different to him and then major crimes will get out there and maybe they'll say something different to

(5:48:48) him You know the story will change a little bit each time

 Question for you Wait And were were you always working in

(5:48:55) the same location you said you're from uh Southern California or Wait

 And you

(5:49:01) were was it um are you able to say like which

 i don't want to say which

 That's

(5:49:06) fine But it's in Southern California Okay And you you weren't like moving around like you weren't in Texas one day

(5:49:12) It's always been in the Southern California Okay Gotcha And so you're saying it's not just that there was a

(5:49:17) lack of evidence These women would admit that they was false

 Yes Interesting

 And

(5:49:24) you're saying the majority of the calls you got it they admitted to it being

(5:49:29) false

 usually Yeah Yeah Yeah it You'd be amazed at how much of it and that's why

(5:49:35) it pisses me off when chicks do that because when women are really assaulted

(5:49:41) you know or the other thing that'll happen is

 dad walks in on daughter having sex and he claims the boy was

(5:49:50) raping her

 Gaping rape Yeah Yeah That's And that was not the case at all It was

(5:49:56) consensual But that's his do that's his minor daughter Well my minor daughter wouldn't you know

(5:50:03) and all of a sudden she's like "Oh yeah he was." You know it's like come on

 I have a question Also something and

(5:50:10) people might call me like woke for this but I actually do think that this is one way uh when it comes to like

(5:50:16) African-American men if they're dealing with a white woman I've heard that that

(5:50:22) the incidence rate of a false accusation uh increases

(5:50:28) uh dramatically and that a lot of because there's this racial component where the white woman

(5:50:36) she she feels like on a wrongly being judged or shamed for it And then in an

(5:50:43) an effort to relieve her her shame or whatever she's going to heinously

(5:50:50) falsely accuse a black man of uh this crime And so like Patrice O'Neal I think

(5:50:58) rest in peace Patrice O'Neal one of my favorite comedians he got I think he got caught up in something like that I don't

(5:51:05) know the whole details but I hear this this a lot A lot of white women

(5:51:10) doing black men dirty

 like Anyways um it's a very good point

 Uh so but

(5:51:19) do you ever recall like I don't know if they the officers who would relay this information to you do you recall like

(5:51:26) would they ever would the women ever say the reason like why they made it up was it was it like regret was it revenge

(5:51:33) what were there any like primary reason generally it was a revenge thing or they

(5:51:38) were screwing around and didn't want to get caught

 Yeah a lion woman is a dangerous woman

 Yeah that's usually the

(5:51:44) big one They don't want to get caught Damn

 Anyways um well we'll move off of

(5:51:50) that but uh thank you for sharing that with me

 I have a question though Is there consequences for women that do that like there should be but a lot of

(5:51:56) times there aren't they just kind of let it go and you know they I believe there

(5:52:02) was one case where they did blame her for doing false 911 calls but other than

(5:52:09) that no generally that's just the end of it and

 I feel like the women that do that should have like a higher like

(5:52:15) consequence because they're like putting Yeah

 Oh I think so too I'm somewhat conflicted

(5:52:21) on it though because on one hand like your immediate instinct is well it's a

(5:52:26) crime to submit like a false make a false police report

 but on the other hand I think in furtherance of justice

(5:52:34) and I I know this is like a really shitty way to approach it but if the woman is more likely to fess up admit to

(5:52:43) lying

 and that spares the man that she falsely accused

(5:52:50) Like I think they should be prosecuted but pragmatically speaking

(5:52:57) if it even like one additional woman is like well I'm willing to admit to it to

(5:53:03) having made the false accusation and I'm doing this because I'm less likely to be

(5:53:09) prosecuted for it I know like it's just a shitty situation all around but I'm

(5:53:14) kind of like and I don't know how the chat's gonna but I'm kind of looking at it pragmatically of like how can we save

(5:53:21) another man from being drugged through So it's like it's a really shitty

(5:53:27) situation I think if those women were held accountable they would never confess or

(5:53:32) lie in the first place because if there was repercussions to those actions in the first place those women would never

(5:53:38) lie That is a good that is also a good point though You do raise a good point is

 if there were repercussions would

(5:53:44) they not do it to begin with

 no they wouldn't

 I think a lot of us

 and I think and you got to be able to hold

 like

(5:53:51) think about murder right like murder has really bad repercussions but people still commit murder

 So it's like

 you

(5:53:59) don't know what it'd be like if it wasn't illegal right

 so Oh you don't have the legal Yeah I guess that's true

(5:54:05) Yeah murder was legal It's very complicated

 Well I I don't know what do you think if there were really severe

(5:54:15) Yes Because these men are losing their lives and there's freedom over a lie That's a good point I'm actually I could

(5:54:21) maybe change my mind on that Like if if it is the case that if the if there were

(5:54:26) consequences and the you know prosecutors did prosecute people who make false accusations that could also

(5:54:34) decrease the problem in the first place It's tough though

 I think it should It's tough

 It should like 100% It's illegal

 I

(5:54:41) think usually the just the DA doesn't want to touch it When push comes to shove it's about what does the DA want

(5:54:47) to file and I think they don't want to file those kinds of cases

 in my opinion And that's just my opinion

 Question on

(5:54:54) that is do you think though that I feel like the premise of that is it's very premeditated versus like a quick

(5:55:00) emotional decision that they're making cuz if it's a quick emotional decision are they

(5:55:05) really factoring in oh well there's going to be repercussions for it that's women for you though They don't think

(5:55:11) about you know the consequences of their actions until later on you know and some women don't even see it for themselves

(5:55:18) ever So I don't think it would change Yep Uh we're going to move it on We have

(5:55:24) Dr Krypto Oh wait Hold on Dropkick 2000 Let's have some arm wrestling matches

(5:55:31) Okay

 let's do it

 Um

(5:55:36) do you guys want to arm wrestle oh my gosh

 Okay I don't know Maybe that's a bad idea They're going to knock

(5:55:42) their mics over

 and gonna fall

 All right We have Dr Krypto 1982 Thank you man

(5:55:48) Thank you Dropkick You all except Jade Warwick need to come to Balkan to learn

() 

(5:55:54) how to be real woman

 You all lost your ways You have it too easy in life So you

(5:56:00) forget who is here to save you when you are in trouble Thank you Dr Krypto 1982

(5:56:06) How are you going to be here to save us when we're in trouble with your invulcan right

 but thank you

 All of y'all except

(5:56:13) J

 Learn how to be a real woman And this real woman oppressed How are women oppressed

 i don't remember

 I don't know

(5:56:21) um other ways

 I thought you were sexist Come on Oh we discussed um being on the spectrum A lot of women are not

(5:56:26) diagnosed with ADHD and autism at a young age simply because they have to train their minds to mask So yeah Oh

(5:56:34) you're welcome Anytime Anytime you need that from me

 Well you know what how about this though here's my counter

(5:56:40) argument Men are wrongly diagnosed when it's just perhaps natural boy behavior

(5:56:46) to be a bit rambunctious But instead the female teachers are like "Oh my god the boys are so rambunctious Let's go put

(5:56:52) them on rolin Let's put them let's put Oh these boys

(5:56:58) are a little disruptive when you're forcing them to sit in a classroom and shut up for 8 hours per day when they

(5:57:04) want to be out running and moving and all this [ __ ] Let's go put them on methamphetamine

(5:57:09) M I think that that's more uh oppressive towards towards boys than like oh sad

(5:57:17) violin Oh my god the poor girls aren't getting diagnosed

 But we shouldn't blame

(5:57:22) like boys or girls We should blame the adults because why are adults not like making sure you know what I mean like

(5:57:27) when I was younger they were like oh she's acting quiet Let's take her to the doctor to see what's up They put something on my ears you know whatever

(5:57:33) But like people pay attention to me They should do it to the boys too You know what I mean like paying attention to kids

 Yeah Boys are often overlooked

(5:57:39) because this boy tendency to you know play rough and use your hands Boys are you know active creatures So it's

(5:57:46) overlooked that you know these boys don't maybe have ADHD They just hype

(5:57:52) hyperactive

 That's what happened

 That's normal That's normal through the teenage years And adolescence is normal I was in

(5:57:58) uh like fourth grade fifth grade female teacher and I was like a little you know

(5:58:04) I'd have like my my uh friend my my buddy sitting next to me and we'd be like you know chatting or whatever We

(5:58:11) shouldn't we shouldn't have been doing it but whatever We'd be like laughing and whatever giggling and then just kind

(5:58:17) of a little not like throwing [ __ ] and like anything crazy like that Just you

(5:58:22) know we'd talk and whatever So my [ __ ] and this is the 90s okay this is

(5:58:29) in the 90s so like I don't know I feel like people listen to teachers a bit more So my teacher went to my parents

(5:58:34) and was like "Hey your son's a little disruptive whatever." Within a month I'm

(5:58:40) on [ __ ] riddlin

 Luckily my myself I was like I don't like this medication As

(5:58:46) a I don't know I was like 9 10 years old or whatever I was like I don't like it I was only on it for a little bit Uh but

(5:58:54) yeah teachers just go the parents and and I I don't blame my parents though

(5:58:59) because this was a different time like in the '9s it's like now there's a lot

(5:59:04) more doubt when it comes to like the health care system and stuff

 True

 But

(5:59:10) you know back then in the '9s it's just like the doctor says to do it you do it Yeah I can agree It's easier to just say

(5:59:17) that something is wrong with the child rather than somebody saying "Oh I cannot

(5:59:23) handle that child." It's them avoiding the truth I know somebody exactly like that They went on their medication when

(5:59:28) they was younger They didn't like it All All he needed to do was you know run it out live it out It's completely normal

(5:59:35) for a boy to be hyperactive So I think it's more so the adults fault for looking at it like it's something wrong

(5:59:41) instead of just letting kids be kids right yeah Word Okay moving on Uh thank you for

(5:59:47) that message though from uh Doc or was it how did we get a riddle on Rinano

(5:59:54) whatever Oh the repression thing You said well the women not being diagnosed with the tism

 Mhm

(6:00:01) Okay All right Anything else as to how women are oppressed or no okay Well

(6:00:07) moving on Karen did I say it right godamn

 Kin

 is that your real name

 yeah

(6:00:14) really it's not your like OF name Okay Uh you said you well the statement is men are more privileged in society than

() 

(6:00:21) women to which you agree Why is that

(6:00:26) the pretty factor i don't know I think men are more privileged because they're prettier

 Well no Oh no Men are I'm sorry

(6:00:33) I listened to you wrong

 Oh because

 No I do think that like I think that they're

(6:00:39) not more I don't know I I'm stuttering on this one I was just sitting here silent for like

(6:00:45) 10 minutes Oh wait That was the wrong one Okay Um I'm not talking

(6:00:52) I think that men have like certain like there's a guy can just go and do

(6:00:57) something and whereas girls can't really like what

 I don't know like I wouldn't

(6:01:03) say like privilege is the right word but I feel like for example the thought

(6:01:09) process of going to do something as a female is different in a guy's head when

(6:01:15) they go to do something So like you I have to think through it's so I think that's a privilege right so it's like

(6:01:20) guys can just say "Oh I'm just going to like walk next like to my friend's house down the street and I'll go like hang

(6:01:28) out with him." Versus if a girl did that like I could but like you have to think through okay is it safe is it this is

(6:01:34) that I think that's like a privilege to men that like can just go and do what

(6:01:40) they want whereas women have to like think through like certain things more

(6:01:45) Not like I thought through that response Okay Uh so okay going to Leah you said

(6:01:52) you think men are more privileged in society than women Why is that

 i feel like you guys made the rules Like all

(6:01:58) the things that you're arguing about who made that up i never like

 Oh am I right

 what do you mean who made

(6:02:05) what up

 like the whole like beauty center or the whole like women should stay at home and like

 standards

 Yeah

(6:02:12) Like isn't it based off what men like or you know what I mean uh I mean I think

(6:02:18) there's there's the male gays and then there's like female gays So

 I don't think men care about

(6:02:26) your nails

 like your fake nails That's that's woman [ __ ]

(6:02:31) No This world was built for women Men are not more privileged Men do what they do for women

 Men are simple creatures If

(6:02:39) a woman say she want to travel on a highway they go build it If a woman say she want a house he either go buy it or

(6:02:44) build it So I don't think that you know it's wrong for a man to ask for something in the

(6:02:51) society that he creates And I think it's wrong for a woman to deny it because it's the least you can

(6:02:58) do

 I feel like maybe she had really good luck with men but not all men are like that Like a lot of men can be the top

(6:03:03) 10% and build a highway for you or do whatever for you I feel like you really got to like be independent in the

(6:03:09) society as a woman and the rules like I'mma depend on a man because I know I

(6:03:15) need one I'm not about to sit here and say you know [ __ ] men and and that's just a trend that's going on right now

(6:03:22) Like the opposite gender hate trend is really unattractive to me just because

(6:03:27) we need each other So to disrespect each gender just because of something we

(6:03:33) don't like it's just like it's it's um it's not logical

 What was the question

(6:03:39) the original question are men more men are more privileged in society than

(6:03:44) women to which you agree

 Yeah I don't think men are

 you think that men are more like are stronger than women right

(6:03:50) so like let's say like isn't that a privilege

 it's just a fact

 Yeah that's a fact

(6:03:56) That's got nothing to do with privilege Pretty privileged You probably never pay to go into nightclubs Men have to pay

(6:04:02) Correct When the last time you paid for your drink or or dinner or anything you haven't man got to do it all

 Even took

(6:04:09) like one time It was $50 guys

 Oh damn I guess you just weren't able to get in

(6:04:14) the VIP line then

 I don't

 Sorry Not all of us are cut out for

 I think maybe

(6:04:20) Canada is different than the US because I don't really expect like a men

 They have cars there

 I think being a woman is

(6:04:26) the same everywhere though no matter I didn't know that they had

 Do you guys

(6:04:31) have internet in Canada

 no barely

 Yeah Yeah

 You picked the wrong country to

(6:04:37) immigrate to um

 I didn't pick I would have come to the US

 You should have gone to Florida

 I would have

 they speak

(6:04:44) Spanish there

 Yeah

 [ __ ] this She's in Toronto What the [ __ ] is so cool guys

(6:04:49) cuba's Caribbean

 Just go [ __ ] Cuba Caribbean

 I don't have a choice guys It's a uh Is Cuba tropical or

(6:04:56) subtropical

 yeah it's the Caribbean Tropical [ __ ] Then you end up in Toronto Cold ass

(6:05:02) Okay So basically we don't really get to leave the country by our choice So my mom got married to a Canadian guy and that's how we were able to go to Canada

(6:05:09) cuz Canadians can travel to Cuba like for vacation whereas American people can go to Cuba Cubans can't leave the

(6:05:15) country

 Did she divorce him

 yeah but he he was not good

 after the green card

(6:05:20) Yeah

 she got her green card

 He kicked her out of the house with everything

 Was it cuz she's a spicy Latina

 she was but

(6:05:27) he knew But it wasn't that I think

 he knew ahead of time

 Yeah

 Yeah

 he's kind of [ __ ] up Let's talk about it

 Uh all

(6:05:33) right Anybody else men are more privileged than women How so anybody

 not

(6:05:39) me or her

 Actually you didn't even circle that one

 I didn't

 No you didn't

(6:05:46) Me

 I said yes

(6:05:51) Yeah How just how how are men more privileged

 i feel like like we live in a men's world Like you know what I mean

(6:05:58) okay

 Mhm Like I don't know I feel like women are submissive like they have to

(6:06:04) be kind of like good or they can't like Thank you Natalia

 You know

 I don't know We have to follow the rules

 Well what do

(6:06:10) you mean you have to you don't

 Okay Like I'm so used to smiling like this and like never disagreeing with somebody

(6:06:16) because you know it's just easier Do you get punished if you don't smile

 i

(6:06:23) think so I feel like I get treated differently People just kind of like think I'm a [ __ ] or whatever I don't know

 Are you

 a little bit but

 a little

(6:06:30) bit She admits it just don't think it's a man's world Like we have women in government so it's no longer just a

(6:06:37) man's world

 That's right But who did it like begin with you know what I mean

 it began with the man of course but it

(6:06:44) ended up being for women because that's what men want wanted anyway Correct

 I

(6:06:49) just feel like the world is not easier for women or for a men You know what I mean like mostly in different areas cuz

(6:06:55) you were saying like in the whole universe you know like the whole world like women's life is easier No not

() 

(6:07:00) everywhere guys Maybe here Where isn't a woman's life easier

 well the Middle East Literally

 Middle East It's not easy to

(6:07:07) be a woman

 But I guess

 or like having a kid Okay Whose resp

(6:07:14) but even then those Middle Eastern women still have it easier than

 I lived in the Middle East and it was I had no problem

(6:07:22) So okay Men are you're saying men are in power right you're saying men are in power

 but can

(6:07:28) you explain how men's interests have been prioritized over women's interests

(6:07:35) okay Interest I don't even care about that But like men's like health okay research consider to do with men's you

(6:07:42) know stuff There's so much thing done about that

 What do you mean

 like I don't know Um

 give me an example

 An example

(6:07:47) Okay I think there was a thing that they found out that would affect like men's like

(6:07:53) like reproductive thing like they couldn't have like I don't what's the word they couldn't reproduce anymore

(6:07:59) because of something I think it was something to do with like Bluetooth or something I don't remember

 Bluetooth

(6:08:04) yeah it was something I don't remember you got to stop reading those Cuban journals

 Cuban newspapers

 no I'm not

(6:08:11) there

 I don't think I don't know Bluetooth is [ __ ] their sperm count

(6:08:16) up or something I don't Maybe it's the case

 Look it up But also

 what about health though what about health why

 like

(6:08:22) there's not that much like research done about like women taking birth control and the effect on like their body also

(6:08:28) to do with like medicine Wait can I just finish being privileged

 okay wait Finish your

 I'm not against anything I'm not

(6:08:34) against anything The question was

 yeah but okay Birth control What about it like there isn't that much research done

(6:08:40) and it's a very like it's something that impact

 Wait wait wait hold on How many forms of birth control do women have i

(6:08:46) thought we was talking about men

 I know but she's saying that there's not enough research about women's hold on birth

(6:08:54) control dozen plus forms of birth control for women There's

 I wouldn't know

 only there's vasectomy for men

(6:09:03) and there's no forms of birth control really for men I mean besides condiment

(6:09:09) vasectomy

 Okay Okay That was not a good example maybe

 Yes But to

 give me another one

 any medicine like

 what about okay

(6:09:16) look up where did the research like happen what type of like people do they had at the research it was going to say men yeah I have a good counter argument

(6:09:23) because women actually their period and their cycle really like gets I think [ __ ] upffects exactly so they didn't

(6:09:29) want to research on women

 yeah I could agree that you know there could there could be an argument made that if these

(6:09:35) drugs are not tested on as many women or women at all then that could have some

(6:09:41) negative impact on women I don't know uh you know specifically what medications

(6:09:47) like I think Tylenol has a pretty similar uh you know profile in terms of

(6:09:53) what it does in men and women uh all these kind of medications but to your

(6:09:58) point of these medications being uh researched hold on uh one sec I don't

(6:10:06) know if it's evidence of privilege that the males are more likely to be guinea

(6:10:11) pigs in drug testing So your argument is well hold on so more

(6:10:18) men

 are more likely to and perhaps more willing to be g literal guinea pigs for

(6:10:25) experimental drug testing We don't know what the potential side effects of the

(6:10:31) the these experimental medicines are I I feel like feminists would also make the

(6:10:37) claim like for example what if I said what if I was a a misogynist and I said

(6:10:43) you know what we're not going to test medications on men because male lives are more valuable So we're going to only

(6:10:49) test these experimental medications on women because we value their lives less But it wasn't because

 But the reality is

(6:10:56) is these experimental medications are used more on men they're more likely to

(6:11:02) be part of these trials where they're getting pumped full of who knows what experimental drugs I don't think that's

(6:11:09) a privilege actually I think that that's emblematic of the disposability of men

(6:11:14) and the fact that men find themselves in like I get I don't know if like super

(6:11:20) wealthy men are wanting to be experimented on but I would suspect it's men of a lower socioeconomic status who

(6:11:27) are like put this drug into me and pay me the money for the drug trial because

(6:11:32) I really really need money I see women as far less desperate So I think that

(6:11:37) would point towards women's privilege

 I feel like you got it But

 thank you

 But

(6:11:43) wait checkmate

 The issue is not that they're selling the medicine saying "Oh this is good for you This is good for

(6:11:48) that." But they don't know what it's going to do to a woman's body They know what it does to a man's body And also it wasn't because of like oh the men need

(6:11:54) the money It was because it was easier to test on men because men don't have all that thing that changes every like week or whatever I don't know But you

(6:12:00) know what I'm saying also the thing that they affected men it was co vaccines

(6:12:06) I remember Well then I mean wouldn't it make sense then if they can get more reliable

(6:12:13) results from men because men don't have this like hormonal fluctuation

 but that

(6:12:19) then you're not really saying "Oh this is actually good for your body." You don't know how it affects a woman's body

(6:12:24) You know what I mean i'm I mean we have a PhD here who maybe

(6:12:29) can weigh in on this

 Okay But like now that I remember

 are are the profiles like maybe the dosing could be different

(6:12:37) but like is a drug given to a man going

(6:12:42) to have like marketkedly different like is is there any drug that you can

(6:12:49) give to a man that is going to be completely different if you give it to a

(6:12:55) woman

 perhaps like excluding gender hormones or whatever I don't know I don't know about that But okay the COVID

(6:13:02) 19 thing Okay the vaccine apparently like there was like three men that had an issue with that thing going on there

(6:13:08) There was so much research done right away Women they were getting like blood vessels and stuff like that because of the vaccine Like how much time did it

(6:13:15) take for them to give a [ __ ] about that i don't think you work on it right

 well

(6:13:21) the thing with with drug testing and trials is that there's

(6:13:26) a process right you don't just if you're testing a drug for

(6:13:32) say a threemon three-month old babies that have a six toe Okay I'm giving an

(6:13:38) example and you're trying to create a drug that treats three-month old babies

(6:13:43) with a six toe You're not going to test your drug on three-month old babies with

(6:13:49) six toes That's not going to be your first line First it goes through all the

(6:13:54) different tests and then there's animals and then you have males 18 to a certain age depending on the country It can be

(6:14:01) 25 it can be 26 depends on the country And then you have and healthy males this

(6:14:08) age and then you have healthy females this age and you have healthy there's different brackets right and so

(6:14:15) it's true that men do get tested first before women So that is a true factor um

(6:14:22) of that as far as the COVID vaccine and your the welts I'm not sure exactly what

(6:14:27) you're talking about

 Well I'm going to move on just for the sake of time but we got Dur Dolls This trumpet is just

(6:14:32) making [ __ ] up Canada is 100% the same Okay All right Thank you Dur Dolls

(6:14:38) Appreciate it He called you a trumpet How do you feel about that

 i actually don't know what that means

 Okay cool Uh

(6:14:44) All right Let's see Women are the primary victims of war Leah you're the only person who agreed with that Why is

(6:14:49) that um because I feel like men could defend themselves more and I feel like women

(6:14:56) get like a lot of things happen like rape and stuff like that through like I'm not saying that men don't go through

(6:15:02) that too but who is more likely to be a victim if like there was a conflict right now

(6:15:09) men

 Men

 The military fighting or wars They're going to be the infantry

 Yeah Most men going to war A woman ain't

(6:15:15) trying to go to war

 Okay Yeah That's right But I'm talking about like like the people are coming here We're just

(6:15:20) chilling This is not where the war is happening You know what I mean like

 well if we're being invaded you'll have infantry men protecting the homeland

 and

(6:15:28) they will be protecting you So you don't want a man protecting you if we go to war

 i like would but I also

(6:15:35) want to defend myself Like I wouldn't expect that

 I think they're going to go defend like fight I don't know

 My point

(6:15:41) was just that like is a man more likely to be able to defend himself if there was a war right now

 are you talking about the ci civilians civilians or

(6:15:48) military

 civilians this whole time

(6:15:54) Um

 cuz you're right that 100% men are more likely to go to war Women I don't think go to war

 That that's not an

(6:16:00) accurate statement I was in the military and I can attest that that's not true But I was in the Marine Corp

 Men like

(6:16:07) you know the people that are like drafted Marine Corps

 officer or enlisted enlisted

 Yeah But I would trust um

 Are

(6:16:13) women getting drafted now

 i don't need to get into it What rank were you dishonorably discharged

 no I was not I

(6:16:20) was medically retired

 Oh okay

 I wasn't supposed to womanism No

 Do they allow

(6:16:25) autistic people

 every Marine is autistic pretty much It's a requirement

 How

(6:16:31) though marines are not known for being the smart ones We're known for being craters

(6:16:37) You say you're autistic Brian right have you ever um gotten drafted or gotten

(6:16:43) picked to be in the military or anything like that no I was I've not been drafted Can you qualify as autistic

 there's no

(6:16:49) draft

 Can you qualify if you're autistic apparently I could join the Marines

 Sure can

 Yeah I don't know Well I'm probably

(6:16:56) uh I don't know I don't know if I'm aged out of the military but um

 How old are you

 36

(6:17:01) I think uh Space Force and and Air Force will still take you

 Nice Okay

 I think

(6:17:08) Space Force is a thing now We got to give them respect

 Can you stop making the noise over there please all right Uh

(6:17:16) would you say I'll just move off them what

 uh people of color can't be racist towards white people You agree you agree

(6:17:24) why is that um they can't

(6:17:30) I said they could

 Oh you know what that's only uh that's only an here You

(6:17:37) said people of color

 Anna Fumi by the way People of color can't be racist They can be prejudice or have bigot they can

() 

(6:17:44) be bigots but I don't think that they can be racist against

 so like you couldn't be racist towards me

 no racism

(6:17:50) racism is about oppression and the

 could you be racist towards her that girl next to you Jade

 no I couldn't sure

 what if

(6:17:58) you're you didn't like Welsh people or something

 that xenophobic

 yeah I think

 I

(6:18:04) don't know she's white

 the race it would be the the white race

 xenophobic is kind

(6:18:09) from Wales and you're like Can she Can she be racist towards me cuz she's Latina

(6:18:17) Uh no

 And then she

 No one can be racist Ty My bad She's Tai

 They can be prejudic

(6:18:24) Can Can Ty be racist

 i'm the most racist person I know So

 oh [ __ ] I guess

 I do

(6:18:30) hear Asians I do hear a lot that Asians do be racist

 They're racist against other Asian

 Latinos do

 Latinos too Yeah

(6:18:39) Do Africans

 Do the Cubans get a lot of heat or

 We do cuz I feel like we have a lot of people that are like white and

(6:18:46) also black So we kind of colorist like I feel like we call people like I have an ant We call it like lenegra Like that's

(6:18:52) literally the end word

 Oh yeah Don't say that But um

 No like it's Spanish black Yeah Yeah

 What do you mean racist

(6:18:59) against other Mexicans

 like there's the white Mexicans

 Gringo Yeah

 That's what

(6:19:04) they call y'all

 Anyways wait So hold on But why can't a like a black person be

(6:19:10) racist towards white people white person Um just because racism is about um oppression and so it doesn't work that

(6:19:17) way I'm sorry

 What's your definition of racism

 it just doesn't work that way So my definition of racism is when people

(6:19:23) who have um when the majority of um the people who are in control and sorry I am

(6:19:29) so sleepy I'm going to wake up I'm going to wake up Okay But yes so racism basically only goes in one direction So

(6:19:36) that's how it works you can be prejudiced or you know um bigoted

(6:19:41) against somebody um a white person but your um racism is just it's different

(6:19:48) than that it's not the same racism to

 J I just want to know educate me what's

(6:19:54) the definition of racism racism is when a person of color is treated differently

(6:20:00) or profiled or

 mistreat racism at all this is my definition so you asked me what it was made to

(6:20:07) Did you make the dictionary how about I finish first and then you can talk to me Okay give me the actual

 Don't start with

(6:20:12) me I won't start back I promise Um so this is my definition

 She wants if you

(6:20:18) treat someone differently because of the color of their skin you are being racist towards them

 It doesn't matter what

() 

(6:20:24) color your skin is

 or theirs

 If it's different and you're treating them differently that's racist and that's

(6:20:31) [ __ ] up

 Good for you I think it's offensive when people say black people can't be racist towards white people

(6:20:38) because when you're saying that black people cannot be racist you're equivalating racism to power and you're

(6:20:43) saying black people cannot have power and we have come a long way to gain power and gain our education and gain

(6:20:49) our rights to say that we do not have power It's a contradiction and it's disrespectful towards the black race

(6:20:56) Interesting perspectives y'all It's the definition though Oh you want

(6:21:02) me to keep talking um yes So I disagree and that's just my opinion I deal with a lot of people who discuss these things

(6:21:08) all the time

 So you're admitting that black people don't have power

 I'm not admitting to anything like that

 That's

(6:21:13) what that sound like to me

 I think you just went in a circle and chased your tail around when you answered that

(6:21:18) question but that's you And we all have different opinions on what's racism

(6:21:23) and what happens with others Oh there are if you had an experience where you felt people were being racist towards

(6:21:30) you that's your feelings Other people might disagree Like if you felt like I

(6:21:35) was being racist towards you other people might be like "No that's not true." Right so it's based on opinion

(6:21:41) And you know race is just a social construct anyway So what are we supposed to do with it

 damn a [ __ ] getting lynched and that was his opinion

(6:21:48) Right that don't sound like an opinion to me That sound like facts and that sounds like a that sounds like somebody

(6:21:53) that didn't have power and they lost it all because of the color of their skin Yeah that's racism That's I mean that's

(6:22:02) racist towards a white person

 No you have an opinion dictionary

(6:22:08) definition

 Yeah What would be an example person

 yes

 Racism against a white person

(6:22:13) Like what would have to be said for it to be racist against white

 she didn't even want to sit next to me

(6:22:20) Well that's cuz your name is a parent But um what was your question Ann

 oh I just

(6:22:27) It's Anna Anna Fi Um and so my question was simply uh what would be a great like

(6:22:33) what's a good example of someone um being racist towards a white person a person of color being racist towards a

(6:22:39) white person Like what would define that treating a white person differently because of the color of their skin There

(6:22:45) was a school I think in Northern California where they had

 How would you know if somebody's treating you differently they had a case study

 They

(6:22:52) had there was a school in Northern California that had

 um a meet and greet

(6:22:57) for all the new kids coming to school and it specifically said it is for brown

(6:23:03) black and indigenous kids

 Okay

 so the white kids were not allowed to attend

(6:23:08) this meet and greet Then it was a picnic that the school was having for the families To me that's racist Wh Why

(6:23:15) can't all the kids go and play why can't all the kids go and meet and greet their whole purpose was that they wanted just

(6:23:22) all the brown kids to meet each other Now see I don't think that's racist should be able to do that Have a party a

(6:23:28) school having a party and not letting the white kids go

 What that was was probably inclusion because what happens

(6:23:35) to black and brown people is we're often excluded

 You're correct

 Correct But

(6:23:40) that's not what What was the situation when have I become

 It was It was the first It was It was a school and it was

(6:23:46) like a private school They couldn't do this in public schools

 but they were just having it was at the beginning of

(6:23:53) the school year and it was literally a meet and greet Come and meet all your new classmates

 Okay that doesn't sound

(6:23:59) like racism though That just sounds like exclusion That's not racism That's exclusion fountain in a white water

(6:24:06) fountain back in the day The white people not being able to racism That was exclusion

(6:24:12) What' you say is two people talking at the same time

 i was just saying like back in the day when there was like you know segregation and there was like a

(6:24:20) literally a black water fountain white like white water fountain that's not racism that's exclusion

(6:24:26) because they weren't

 that was discrimination That's literally what it was Why are we trying to change why are we trying to change the facts of history

(6:24:33) why would why would not inviting a certain race to do something that all the other kids were doing not be racist

(6:24:42) like not be like racism exclusion that's when you got to be able

(6:24:47) to differentiate and learn your definitions That's not racism That just sounds like brown people excluding

(6:24:55) white people which is also unfair but that's not racist That's not racist You

(6:25:00) can't just be throwing the word racist around just because white people not included Bro white people y'all

(6:25:06) literally are everywhere So let's not let's not act like y'all are having

(6:25:11) racism towards y'all all the time for the sake of argument

 It's possible but it's not common

 What if it's white what

(6:25:18) if it's white kids having a meet and greet and we're not letting the black kids come

 is that okay

 i mean that's

(6:25:24) exclusion

 That's not racism

 That's exclusion Because is it are you are you not

(6:25:30) inviting the black kids because they're black or you not inviting the black kids just because they're not inviting because you can separate you can

(6:25:36) separate the actuality and the race You know those two don't have to be together What is the exclusion though it's the

(6:25:43) skin color And that goes back to the definition of racism

 Yeah

(6:25:50) I think I also think I also think culturally like maybe

(6:25:56) white people have different interpretations of a definition like just as a culture versus other

 right No

(6:26:05) let me ask you something though When have you ever when have you experienced racism

 when I went to Puerto Rico to

(6:26:10) watch my to watch my

 I'm sorry

 boyfriend play baseball And I couldn't get anybody

(6:26:15) to wait on me in the mall because I was the white girl at the mall

 Wow So nobody

(6:26:21) waited on you and that was racism You see how we just easily throwing that word around that is not possible You may

(6:26:27) have been left behind You may have been excluded but that's not racism just because a little white girl was left out That's not racism

 My husband absolutely

(6:26:34) I don't think you should be throwing that word around loosely

 They might not have been able to speak your language and that's why they

 correct You know

(6:26:41) Puerto Ricans are Spanish speakers It's in San Juan It's the biggest mall they have They And at that time I could kind

(6:26:48) of speak Spanish Pardon me

 They don't speak Spanish

 Oh so

(6:26:55) don't they speak Portuguese there

 no In Puerto Rico they speak Spanish

 Okay So you went to a Spanish-sp speaking

(6:27:00) country and think it's racism just because you didn't speak Spanish that's what that sound

 That's not what I said That's what that sound like to me

 That's

(6:27:05) not what I said I said they spoke English at the mall I also could speak a

(6:27:11) little bit of Spanish but the people waiting on me were all English speakers It was at Macy's

 So they left you

(6:27:17) because you were white

 Yes Because they don't like white girls there Particularly

 Puerto Rican women don't

(6:27:24) Yes And he's Puerto Rican He's like "Well they didn't want to wait on you cuz you're white." I know I know people don't want to

(6:27:31) believe that but

 Well what were the repercussions of this situation how like were you stoned in the town like Hall

(6:27:38) were you you know did they whip you or like what was the painful part was it

(6:27:44) just that nobody talked to you

 well the thing is they left a little white girl at the mall and that's racism

 Well so

(6:27:50) what's the metric of like whenever it goes from discrimination to like even for black people

 and there's a

(6:27:55) difference between discrimination and racism You know that right and prejudice That's all three of those are different

(6:28:02) I'm just curious Let's say it's against a black person What is your threshold of this is just discrimination and then

(6:28:07) this is where it enters racism So like

 profiling profiling in stores

() 

(6:28:14) profiling by police profiling by um school officials profiling in different

(6:28:19) areas And it's not just um black people also you know um all a lot of people of

(6:28:24) color go through this where they're being profiled simply I mean look at look at ICE Where have you seen them

(6:28:30) going after people and how are they determining what visual would they be

(6:28:36) able to use to determine who might not be from here what visual

 it's not a

(6:28:41) visual They actually people that they are actually targeting You should look at Bill Malujan from Fox News He goes

(6:28:47) "You don't even live here I don't know what you're talking about

 I actually do live here

 I I see ICE every all the time

(6:28:52) from ICE all the time But you're not black so you don't face the same hardships that we do So you cannot speak

(6:29:00) and say white people experience racism But you said that white kids being

(6:29:05) excluded from a brown party was racism That just sounds like discrimination to me or exclusion It doesn't sound like

(6:29:11) racism Y'all throwing that word around too loosely

 Yeah So if you went to Macy's and Puerto Rico and let's say the

(6:29:18) tables were turned and you didn't get like no one came up to you no one helped

(6:29:24) you you were upset like they were just ignoring you and you were adamant about it and you were upset that no one came

(6:29:32) up to you

 and it's not

 and that has actually happened to me in Puerto Rico Did you think it was racist of them

 i

(6:29:38) think that it was discrimination because I was one of the darkest ones in the restaurant of course

(6:29:44) But have you ever went through that

 yeah of course I've had stuff like happen to me I mean

 let me hear it

 Okay Well I

(6:29:52) mean it's not like I don't think that I've been I think I've been discriminated against because I am white

(6:29:58) in certain situations

 cuz everyone has stereotypes Every you know there's stereotypes for a reason because there's

(6:30:05) people who are inside of the box Same thing with us like or some of the girls here If we have an only fans you get put

(6:30:11) into that box Just because there's that box of like what most because of the

(6:30:17) stereotypes of only fans girls doesn't mean that you fit that exact mold But it

(6:30:22) does mean that a lot of the girls in that industry fit that mold

 I mean in my

(6:30:29) opinion there are some tr truths to stereotypes

 Sure

 But you still didn't

(6:30:34) you still didn't answer my question though When have you ever been discriminated against for being a white

(6:30:39) girl or when has anybody ever been racist to you for being a white girl

 um

(6:30:45) last weekend driving to Atlanta and I got pulled over um by a Mexican cop And

(6:30:55) did he tell you he was Mexican or you assuming he Mexican cuz you know there are hundreds of Latino countries

 Okay He

(6:31:00) was Latina Sorry that was I just I

 Wow that's racist That is so [ __ ] racist

(6:31:06) You just assume that a Latino was Mexican

 and not not Salvadorian

 It could

(6:31:11) have been something else and not nothing I agree I agree

 I don't I don't I kind of do just like I'm from California so

(6:31:19) most of the Latinos I grew up with were from Mexico so sorry me

(6:31:26) How is that racist was like no one asked me like okay are you German or you ScotsIrish like we just say white Like

(6:31:32) it's nationality though That's what makes the difference between race and nationality You're white Germanity

(6:31:38) That's ethnicity And nationality is two different things She was just saying this guy's an American I'm assuming if

(6:31:43) he's pulling you over in the United States nationality Ethnicity is what she was

(6:31:48) saying

 Okay So how was it racist explain Well

 he pulled you over What were you doing to get pulled over

 i So what I was

(6:31:55) moving with the speed of traffic but he was just out there to

 So you got pulled over for speeding You know you can say

(6:32:01) that right

 yeah I got pulled over for speeding So you got pulled over for speeding by a Latino cop and that's racist No

 that's discriminatory

 I was

(6:32:08) literally not doing anything Some people get shot by police and children even

(6:32:14) just for looking like they're guilty So I mean I don't think that you children get shot by police for looking like

(6:32:21) they're guilty Where did that happen

 oh uh a lot boy

(6:32:27) He had a play toy and was shot at 11 years old Killed

 Okay Wait wait wait Whoa Time time out Play toy and he got

(6:32:34) killed How was he was it a play

 shot down by officer Was he holding something it was a water gun We can look this up

(6:32:41) We can look this up and fact check

 Mhm Okay

 But no we not about to run from

(6:32:46) this because you said that you have been Let me hear

 Okay so I am a Trump supporter I was wearing my MAGA hat and

(6:32:53) he's pulls me over and I was going with the speed of traffic I was not even in the fast lane Like I literally wasn't

(6:33:00) speeding and I have a fast car and I do speed at the right time when it's like safe But in that moment I literally was

(6:33:06) like I think I was going like four over or something He was just riding tickets Wait So you think it's cuz of the MAGA

(6:33:12) hat

 maybe that's not your skin color We're talking about race

 But considering the situation it was just like I was

(6:33:19) like this is not I don't know I was just I mean we can talk about the massacre in

(6:33:25) South Africa right now that

 right

 I'm not I'm not I you told me you asked me to give you an example

 for sure

 I felt I

(6:33:32) felt like I really truly wasn't doing like anything wrong considering I was like with every other car around me

(6:33:41) it just sounds like you avoiding accountability You got pulled over for speeding and you want to blame a cop for being Mexican He probably wasn't even

(6:33:48) Mexican I hope that cop watching I hope you drop your nationality in this [ __ ] comments now

 Drop it

 I hope he's

(6:33:55) Mexican Let's go

 You better hope he's Mexican You were right about him being

(6:34:01) Mexican but you wasn't right about him being

 like actually I'm Chinese My name is Officer Wong There's another

(6:34:08) indicator but whatever I mean I get it I agree with you I don't think that I think there's different levels of racism

(6:34:15) Did I have any Did I get hurt physically no like did things happen in that

(6:34:20) situation that made me feel uncomfortable and that like probably like I didn't even have like a say cuz

(6:34:28) it was just like he judged me by the way I looked like immediately when I w when he walked up to the window like I don't

(6:34:35) know I mean it's it's not like I was whipped like we were saying earlier

(6:34:41) there's no repercussions of it and there's different levels of racism but at the end of the day I felt like I was

(6:34:47) judged because of the color of my skin and what I was wearing versus like what like there was he was like pretty rude

(6:34:55) and it was just a it was a very it it just gave me bad bad vibes bad vibes

(6:35:01) Ain't no level to racism you either racist or you're not And bad

(6:35:07) vibes is just because somebody got bad vibes that don't make sense the

(6:35:12) exclusion thing we were talking about earlier with racism It's like how do you say what like

 when there's like black

(6:35:18) water fountains and white water fountains and

 that is ex like and you were saying that white kids weren't

(6:35:24) invited to this party that's but back then you can't say you can't agree with both

 See that's the thing though black

(6:35:30) people I don't have a victim mentality to that

 right Yeah

 What' you say

 don't respond with the $10

 Okay

(6:35:38) Well anyway this is a conversation It is great Yeah it's such a big conversation

(6:35:44) and so heavy Um we've been talking about a lot of different subjects but this one I mean everybody's got their different

(6:35:50) opinions You might feel like you're persecuted um for different reasons And you know how can we really like prove it

(6:35:57) to one another because if somebody tells me "Oh this happened." And I'm like "Wow I've had 10 times worse." We can't all

(6:36:03) like So maybe y'all don't think y'all think it's possible for me to be racist against you I just don't know how I

(6:36:09) could possibly be I could be like you smell like pennies when you go outside or

 I think I think it's possible to

(6:36:15) dance So when you I don't know like what could it's just roasting at that point you know

 when you've been at like a

(6:36:20) store and someone's not talked to you or said something like did you bring it up to the store or anything

(6:36:28) no it was that has never happened to me before Okay

 But what has happened to me before was I have gotten escorted out of

(6:36:34) a building

 for the sake of me just being black For the sake of somebody thinking that I was just up to no good

 Then you

(6:36:41) should sue that building

 Until you feel what that feels Until you feel what that

(6:36:46) feels you cannot put yourself in my shoes

 What' you say

 get a lawyer that works on contingency and sue the

(6:36:52) building for being racist against you Okay And what else since you got everything figured out The lawyers will

(6:36:59) work for free for you and then when they arrive at a settlement they'll take like 33%

(6:37:04) that's not that it took place

 Exactly That's exactly what I'm saying So you trying to go around it and talk it in

(6:37:10) circles or avoid what I'm talking about That's just you know disregarding everything that I'm saying which is kind

(6:37:15) of racist of you

 When when Karen was saying that she felt that way so that wasn't racism there You don't

 a white

(6:37:22) girl got left at a mall in Puerto Rico Like what it's not that I got left at a

(6:37:28) mall I was trying to buy something Now poor Karen has been at the mall Poor

(6:37:35) baby Karen Po baby Karen Being a typical Karen And of course did you call the

(6:37:41) manager

 i'd go up to the register and she'd look at me and walk away Then I'd go up to another register and she'd look

(6:37:48) at a different girl would look at me and walk away A third register possible they

(6:37:53) just don't speak Or maybe they didn't speak Or maybe they didn't speak English Guys guys guys guys One at a time One at

(6:38:00) a time Oh my goodness

 They spoke English Yeah that's a good question May also do that

 Wait what

 uh oh Felicity Um Fidel

(6:38:10) Castro's daughter would like a uh a lollipop

 Can I have one too

 can I have

(6:38:16) one too we we can only do one at a time because

 then there's like too many

(6:38:23) [ __ ] she's like so

 like can you give us just so we can move it on just give

(6:38:28) us a definition of racism

 I already tried I'm so sleepy Okay My definition

(6:38:34) of racism is when somebody is abused based on the color of their skin and the

(6:38:39) direction always goes from the oppressor to the oppressed So it's always in one

(6:38:45) direction And that's my definition I don't want to take

 So are all white Do I have to think hold on Yeah you do have

(6:38:50) to think I know it's I know it's difficult

 I've been thinking all day

 So and your view is white men are or white

(6:38:56) people are the oppressor and black or people of color are the oppressed

 in a society that um there is privilege um to

(6:39:04) being a person a a white person I do feel like um people of color do

(6:39:10) experience a lot of oppression and uh you know um

 people will argue that white

(6:39:16) privilege what does it mean um it's the privilege of not being shot by the

(6:39:21) police or attacked by the police whenever you go

 more white people than they do black people

 Um there's more

(6:39:27) white people than there are black people No everybody gets shot by the police

(6:39:33) Everybody gets shot by the police But would this then be evidence of sexism because the rates of police killing men

(6:39:40) compared to police killing women it's way higher Like the differential between

(6:39:46) uh blacks being killed by police versus whites being killed by police

 So is this

(6:39:52) your argument so So hold on

 Depends on if the officer was a man or a woman

 Hold on Hold on Is this your argument so basically you're saying okay well you're

(6:39:59) saying there's more there's discrepancy when it comes to police misconduct police brutality and police shootings

(6:40:05) And

 blacks are more or black men are more likely to be the victims of this

(6:40:11) Mhm Yeah

 Or black people are more likely to be victims of but it's really black men more likely to be the victims of

(6:40:17) this But if I could show you statistics that that differential is the gap is way

(6:40:24) wider that exists between men and women Mhm

 So there's more men for example

(6:40:30) there's more white men that are killed by police than there are women who are killed by police of all races combined

(6:40:36) Those statistics are true It's only just more televised when it's a black person because that's what the country wants to

(6:40:41) do to black people would send us in an angry uproar and then have us looking crazy and have us acting wild based off

(6:40:48) you know trying to get justice off this one person getting killed you know uh in

(6:40:53) an unequal way by the police Yeah There's also the um prison

(6:40:59) industrial complex which means that we have private prisons that get paid by our government to house people in in

(6:41:07) them So yes

 But what does that have to do with racism what does it have to do with racism and police brutality i think

(6:41:13) that police seek out um they seek out people of color They profile them Yes or

(6:41:18) no would anybody dis would you disagree you don't think I mean

 you know what i'm willing to grant that

 But you said that

(6:41:24) those ladies profiled you at the store when they didn't talk to you So how does it work for you for you and not nobody

(6:41:31) else

 amazing

 Well I'm sure there are some but for the most part cops are not racially profiling They actually have a

(6:41:38) list They they know who in their patrol beat are the dead beats They know the

(6:41:44) people that are the drug users They know people that are the gangbangers They know people that are that commit all the

(6:41:50) crimes And they keep rearresting the same people over and over and over again

(6:41:56) You It's That's not uncommon It's not uncommon

 Okay Um

(6:42:05) Yes Go ahead So basically you can only be racist towards minority groups and it can only be whites who do it

 I think so

() 

(6:42:11) I think

 Can Asians be racist towards black people

 oh yeah We're um if y'all want to know a real little secret uh all

(6:42:18) of us people of color are racist to each other We roast each other all the time We'll say all kinds of wild stuff to

(6:42:24) each other and about each other

 Who has more systemic power in this country Asians or black people

 oh we I don't

(6:42:29) think that's even a I don't think it works like that That's no when I say we

(6:42:35) are racist towards each other we'll just roast each other and be like you know say little things

 It requires power to

(6:42:41) be

 Yeah Wait question

 Power and um um some persecution Power and persecution

(6:42:48) If you if somebody abuses you and then and then you actually some harm comes to

(6:42:54) you there's harm

 Yeah Then that that is the power and the persecution Yeah

 Okay

(6:42:59) So then let's assume there's a black CEO and he refuses to hire a white janitor

(6:43:04) because that janitor is white and this janitor comes from a lower socioeconomic status than the like multi-millionaire

(6:43:12) billionaire black CEO Is that black CEO a racist

 no But he is prejudice and I

(6:43:19) mean it's bigotry he's keeping he's denying somebody the ability to work there But I mean so do you think that

(6:43:26) it's racist for black universities to exist i mean you didn't get invited to a kids party so maybe um maybe y'all think

(6:43:33) that black universities shouldn't exist either that y'all should be allowed to go to them I mean weren't white

(6:43:38) segregation Weren't white people the ones who are like I'm my grandma was a Native American None of y'all's grandmas

(6:43:44) were American Native Americans Like please stop None of us have answer You got to answer my question before I

(6:43:50) answer your question

 Okay What was the question i forgot

 Okay So you have the black CEO and let's say he's like this

(6:43:57) is a uh multi-state uh it's a multi-state company

 It's

(6:44:03) multinational company

 Thousands tens of thousands of employees and it's a system

(6:44:10) This corporation is a system

 Okay

 there they've got offices in in Vegas and Los

(6:44:16) Angeles and San Francisco and New York and Miami and they've got a couple in Europe and he's the he's the big boss

(6:44:23) man He's the owner of the company He's also the CEO And he refuses to hire a white janitor

(6:44:30) And this this white janitor we happen to know some background on him

 He was an

(6:44:35) orphan An orphan And he's also miss He doesn't have a leg

 Well I mean he

(6:44:41) doesn't have a leg

 If he feels that he has a case he can take it to court And yeah okay cool But would you view that

(6:44:49) would you view the black C bill billionaire CEO

 refusing to hire the white janitor because he's white would

(6:44:56) you view that as racist

 i mean I don't think that the billionaire CEO or CEO or

(6:45:02) whatever he is I don't think he would be doing the hiring of Jerry Correct It don't sound like it's about race It

(6:45:08) sound like it's more about money And that's when you got to this when you got to exclude

 Hold on He he normally

(6:45:16) doesn't hire the janitors but it's for his personal bathroom in the corporate headquarters And he's like "You know

(6:45:22) what normally I just let you know my

 I wouldn't hire a poor [ __ ] to be in my rich restroom either." Exactly

(6:45:28) Like what the hell it's about money It ain't about race

 bro You How many rich janitors are there okay So anyways

(6:45:34) exactly You're proving your own point Yeah but janitors have to be hired

 Yeah

(6:45:42) And they're typically not rich

 Okay So it's obviously going to come down to not his socioeconomic status but it's going

(6:45:48) to race

 So it don't sound like it's about race though It just sound about I made it about his race

 Why are we making

(6:45:54) it

 he only had like one leg also so like how can he do the full job

 yeah I'm exaggerating it with a little artistic

(6:46:00) flare and pizzazz and razledazzle Razledazzle Is it racist to refuse to hire the white

(6:46:07) janitor i mean if you can pro prove it in a court of law then you can sue Sure Go

(6:46:13) ahead and try

 No Okay I get that you're you're saying that you the man can sue Do you think it's racist

 no I don't

(6:46:20) think it's racist at all because we can't we can't discern what his reasoning for that was for not hiring

(6:46:25) him

 I literally can't assume in the example I say

 he doesn't want to hire

(6:46:30) the white janitor because the he's white because the color of his skin

 Yes

 Okay Would that be racist

 no

 Still not racist

(6:46:38) Okay How about this barack Obama when he was president let's say he didn't want

(6:46:43) to hire a white janitor to work for him in the White House because that white janitor is white Would that be racist

 no

(6:46:50) Into the mic Into the mic

 Uh no I don't think so

 How could it hold on I'm literally meeting even your honestly

(6:46:57) [ __ ] definition of racism

 I already told you that my racism is a [ __ ] definition So okay So

 so I'm going to

(6:47:05) consistently have the same opinion on it people who are um

 the example you given is pretty simple Yes that's racist

 Okay

(6:47:12) So here's my definition of um somebody who abuses children There are people

(6:47:18) named Anna who wear blue shirts or child abusers Interesting

 Is is that is that enough to

(6:47:26) make you a child abuser

 uh that's called profiling

(6:47:32) What

 you're profiling You're saying people who look like me who have the same name as me That's profiling That's

(6:47:37) not something that doesn't correlate your question here That doesn't correlate to you applying the actual definition of racism Why the hell are

(6:47:45) you

 no because what I'm trying to get Hold on What I'm trying to get at is she's she's completely perverting the

(6:47:51) definition of racism

 Well might agree with me

 Under my definition of racism

(6:47:58) only then then only this racial group can be racist

 But let me ask you a

(6:48:04) question Am I the only person who's ever held this belief system or this opinion that y'all have ever met in your life

(6:48:10) and you're so shocked by this because you've never heard anyone say it or have you heard it before so if there's other

(6:48:16) people's mind

 yeah I've heard it before also say it and these people also have

(6:48:21) the mind virus

 Oh okay I didn't know that there was a mind virus

 It's the woke mind

 He said there's mind viruses

(6:48:27) in here Well I mean you this idea that racism has been completely detached from the

(6:48:34) historically understood definition of the word

 uh yeah is a little confusing

(6:48:40) Tell me some more history people are not the majority of the planet years ago

(6:48:48) White people are minority White people are not in America double standard It's

(6:48:54) not a double standard It's

 conversation all over the place Y'all got to pick a topic and stay on it because are we

(6:48:59) talking about white people in America are we talking about white people in Africa what are we talking about cuz

() 

(6:49:04) y'all got to stick to it

 The word racism what is the definition

 how about this

 if

(6:49:09) I went to Nigeria could black people be racist to towards me in Nigeria

 yeah

(6:49:14) Yeah for sure

 Okay So it's geographic based

 The reason that it's racism in

(6:49:20) this country is because of a lot of history But yeah they could be prejudic

(6:49:28) We elected a black president We elected a black president So the question that I

(6:49:33) was asking you about Barack Obama

 and a black mayor and a black mayor in Dallas and a black mayor in New York and a

(6:49:39) black mayor in Chicago

 Do you have like a list do you know all of them

 okay So let let's talk about the Afro let's talk

(6:53:43) in the world

 I like him twice Let me ask you a question Is the executive branch of the United States government a system

(6:53:50) yes

 Okay Was Barack Obama the leader of that system

 yes I

 So Barack Obama has

(6:53:56) systemic power

 Yes

 Okay So if racism is

(6:54:03) prejudice plus power he's being prejudiced by not hiring a

(6:54:09) white janitor

 Yes he might He has he's arguably the most powerful man in the world because he is the leader of the

(6:54:16) executive branch of the United States government which is the most powerful nation in the world

 Mhm

 How would this

(6:54:22) not even meet your warped definition of racism

 i just don't I don't feel like

(6:54:29) he's like oppressing this man Like he's not hiring him for his personal bathroom

(6:54:34) You you have every right when it comes to your personal property to hire who you choose who you so choose You know

(6:54:40) you don't

 Yeah I mean if I was gonna hire um a cleaner for my home or

(6:54:46) somebody to work on my car okay the right to choose

 Yeah Let me let me explore this logic So the federal

(6:54:52) government if they wanted to could not hire black people because they're black Uh no I don't think that's uh legal here

(6:54:59) I don't think you're allowed to do

 What about white people can they not hire white people because they're white

 no I mean that's

 it would be racist right

(6:55:05) you're allowed to do that You know I think it's just like why are you what they wouldn't hire him because they're white I don't know

 Right But Barack

(6:55:12) Obama he's the it's the executive branch of the federal government

 Yeah Yeah Yeah

(6:55:18) So

 but still that's um his personal bathroom so it's his choice you know

 No

(6:55:23) I don't I'm pretty sure he wouldn't be able to say I don't want like it might

(6:55:29) be

 I mean if he said it out loud yeah people would be like "What are you doing you can't say that." And he would get in

(6:55:35) trouble for it But

 right But would it be racist would it be racist but would it be racist but would it be racist

 would

(6:55:41) it be racist no No I look I don't know how else

 This is my opinion and it doesn't change

 I'm

(6:55:47) literally meeting your definition of racism Prejudice plus power Barack Obama

(6:55:53) had a lot of power

 In this example I'm saying that he is be well he is being

(6:55:58) prejudice

 So it meets your definition Why would it not be racist

 prejudice Yeah But but it's prejudice plus power

(6:56:07) He has power

 This is my opinion

 He has systemic power

 It doesn't change

 He has power He has systemic power

 Yeah he does

(6:56:15) We should point this on

 All right But I don't understand If you're going to if you're going to for

 forward a definition

(6:56:22) and then I meet the criteria for your definition No

 you have to concede

 No but you didn't because my definition was

(6:56:29) that um it can only work in one direction that racism works to affect minorities and um you know subgroups in

(6:56:37) society people of color So my by my definition me saying that it can only work in one direction means that you did

(6:56:44) not meet that criteria So that's just my opinion though These are opinions Like I

(6:56:50) said earlier we all have our different takes and opinions on all of this like all these different things in this world

(6:56:56) Okay

 We just match with people who also share our same views you know like and

(6:57:03) we can all agree on

 get that sound I was like it's my opinion

 What is a woman I mean I don't know I'm

 What is a woman

(6:57:09) what is a woman

 okay I'm glad we're covering all the easy questions

 but let's go to her

 What is a woman

 yeah what is a woman

 i mean we're a woman

(6:57:16) What do you need from me

 no What is What is a woman

 uh definition

 because your definitions seem a bit skewed so I just

(6:57:24) want to make sure We're women I don't know what you want me to say I'm so sleepy I'm trying to figure out where the question is here

() 

(6:57:30) We're women What does it mean we'll define a woman

 Okay Can a trans Is a transgender woman a woman

 uh if that's

(6:57:36) what they want to call themselves yes Yeah Are they a woman though

 um if that's what they want to call themselves

(6:57:42) yes In other countries they call themselves uh um lady boys I don't really I don't really get I don't get

(6:57:49) involved in other people's like lives like that Like it's not my business is if that's what they want to do I don't

(6:57:54) you know power to everybody

 What's the definition of the word that's what we want

 Yeah How do you define woman

 a

(6:58:01) woman is

 words are so subjective and it's very likely

 it's an adult female

(6:58:06) People want to do different things This is just such a heavy convers

(6:58:16) I I barely slept last night but yeah Okay So anybody if they want to call themselves I don't I don't mind what

(6:58:22) people want to call themselves It doesn't matter to me I know what I am I know who I am and I'm happy with that I

(6:58:27) feel like live and let live is a very important value system that

 Yeah That's not a definition of what a woman is What

(6:58:33) is a woman

 do you want me to sing you the song with the

 Nope I don't want to

 I just told you I'm a woman We're a woman

(6:58:39) I don't understand what else you're asking

 Lady boys

 Oh I mean

 so can we ask the person who's from Thailand are lady

(6:58:45) boys men or women and how do they define themselves well being a lady boy in Thailand often

(6:58:52) uh they don't define themselves sexually as a lady They do it for uh monetary

(6:58:58) purpose and to um work That's their job So they dress up and live as a female

(6:59:05) because it is more advantageous to be a female in Thailand There's more job opportunities in the uh adult industry

(6:59:13) So a lot of males will present as females but they do not identify as females

(6:59:19) Wow Curious

 So what is a woman

(6:59:24) hello

 Me Oh

 yeah you sweetie

 So we're women You're a man I um don't know what

(6:59:33) else to say there Like I don't have any strong I don't have any like

 any like

(6:59:38) anything to say on that really to be honest How could we like make for certain like if you were testing us if

(6:59:44) we were women how would you

 I mean I wouldn't be like trying to test y'all and see

 It's a hypothetical

 I know

 Like

(6:59:51) how do you know that we're all women

 i don't know I mean how do you know I'm not trying to just based on my I mean my

(6:59:56) perception of y'all looking at y'all y'all talking to me you saying that you're women I just go by that Like I'm

(7:00:02) not gonna like lift up your skirt and try to like look at you

 I like

 I feel like it's really simple Like if I can

(7:00:08) carry a baby and give life after 10 n months 10 months whatever

 Some of us can't though

 Right Right Right But do I

(7:00:15) have the parts to do that

 yeah of course Yeah

 But does that define a woman

 no I

(7:00:21) think what defines a woman is your DNA Right

 No I don't know what to tell y'all

(7:00:28) Please leave me alone I don't want to have this one Let's have a different conversation

 All right Let's do body

(7:00:33) count

 Okay Body count

 Yeah What's your body count my body count is actually really low Um I don't really sleep with

(7:00:39) a lot of people I'm very um I'm a little OCD about my body and I'm afraid that like people have there's so many STDs

() 

(7:00:46) out there right now You really have to be careful and I don't like to let like it affects you emotionally having

(7:00:52) somebody you sleep with somebody even some people can just have

 some people

(7:00:58) can just have sex and they feel nothing but for me uh

 what's the number

 having a connection is important I don't know the

(7:01:05) number like direct like I can't think of it right now but I know that it's less than like 20 I think So I mean but when

(7:01:12) I was younger I used to party a little bit more I'm sorry you're virgin I'm over here telling you like and then

(7:01:19) but yeah so um yeah that's that's my body count It doesn't really bother me to discuss it I don't think it's a bad

(7:01:25) thing I'm not ashamed There were some that I was ashamed of Some real jerks in there but um yeah it's not a bad thing

(7:01:33) Okay What about you me um I'm trying to

(7:01:38) think because I really I'm kind of the same Like I've been in relationships and I kind of casually dated but I would say

(7:01:46) like definitely like less than 10 but I'm pretty like monogamous and like I

(7:01:51) like to just I don't really have sex until I'm like in a committed

(7:01:57) relationship I would say

 So yeah

 Okay Okay

 But I'm like 36 too So I mean

 it's

(7:02:04) not like I'm like 19 I don't know

(7:14:07) plus

 Yeah sounds about right

(7:14:13) I appreciate your honesty I mean

 it's not like that anymore but

 I think it I

(7:14:19) think it makes me feel sad just because I know that like you have autism and like that you said that you did it to

(7:14:26) like just make friends with people and stuff and it's like yeah I mean I I'm

(7:14:34) sure a lot of other like autistic people can probably relate to that where it's like they probably do things they might

(7:14:41) not want to do or not like You literally said you don't really enjoy sex either And so it's like mindboggling that

(7:14:48) you're putting yourself through stuff It's a lot of

 I know

 that's a lot of

(7:14:54) right

 a lot of dick to not enjoy it Right I know And I feel bad that

 like I

(7:15:00) would

 That's a lot

 Like if I didn't like [ __ ] like if I did not like [ __ ] I don't know if I'd

 do it a second time

(7:15:06) Yeah

 I would [ __ ] a bunch of women I don't know I mean uh have you ever gotten the STD

(7:15:13) um I had a scare one time but no

 I thought it was a false pos

(7:15:22) No I had um

 Can it be is uh you're like in that field of work Can you transmit

(7:15:28) Ebola through

 I mean yeah Ebola is easy Sex

 Yeah you can get Ebola from like

(7:15:34) anything

 Can you get CO through

 sex co Well if you breathe on like suck on the

(7:15:41) person and

 No but like can it transfer through the the peeing the pee pee

 well

(7:15:46) I guess RNA transmission I get Well no that wouldn't make sense

 No

(7:15:53) No I don't think so I don't know I never studied that That's really weird

 I don't think No because it's a it's an aerosol

(7:16:01) virus

 It's an aerosol virus So no that doesn't even make sense Yeah

 it's like it's like uh uh SARS and um MS

 So you

(7:16:11) dodged herpes

 Have you No no not not herpes That was not the one that I was worried about

 But you dodged it

 I don't

(7:16:17) have herpes No

 you dodged the herpes

 No Yeah I dodged the herpes Are we worried about herpes

 this girl's

(7:16:22) like "If you have to bet on somebody

 she rolled the dice You rolled the dice with

(7:16:27) your pussy."

 Yeah

 she rolled the dice with her [ __ ] Houston was still here She would be winning that money in her

(7:16:33) bank account because she was going to bet on you

 Yeah she was cuz she was going to bet on me The one

 cuz I have

(7:16:40) good I do have good uh sexual health knowledge And one time I had the doctor

(7:16:45) tell me she's like oh you cuz I had a scratchy throat and she's like I think you have HIV And she's like you you're

(7:16:52) going to get tested and all this stuff And then it it was a whole like she worked me up into thinking I had HIV and

(7:16:58) then it came back negative and I was like "Oh."

 So that was the scary you were talking about

 Yeah Couple questions though You said that you were

 there were

(7:17:05) a couple times where you did like two in a day What's the most in a day

 i think just

(7:17:12) two

 Two You never did like a three Three in a day

(7:18:08) like if I have to have sex like she could be really hot really hot like I'm

(7:18:14) patting out of my league you know like if if the the 10 that used to be sitting

(7:18:19) there What was her name houston or [ __ ] Austin or some [ __ ] [ __ ] Houston Houston No Yes

 Yeah Like she was

(7:18:27) so out of my league If I could have been lucky enough to ever landed her

 And but she was like "Oh Brian like we can only

(7:18:35) have sex with a condom." I'd just be like "Can okay I guess we'll just go watch Netflix then." I I'd rather not Does

(7:18:42) that Does that

 Do you not like condoms is that what it I don't like like I'd rather just not even have sex

(7:18:50) Is that weird

 abstinence is actually a form of birth control

 You can get tested It's

 weird I don't know

 No

 Why though

 it

(7:18:58) doesn't feels different

 I don't know I don't like all the juices that come out The juices that come the sperm It's

(7:19:04) gross It gets all like

 nasty And I don't want my juices on him And we don't need

(7:19:09) to be combining juices

 I want her juices on me That's juices everywhere We don't

(7:19:14) touch the juices That's gross

 The more juices the better

 Do you wear a condom with your husband

 with your boyfriend

(7:19:22) yes

 So the way you're saying

 you're I was using her words bro

 Every time

(7:19:28) you've had sex you've never had it like the juices touch you

 I I did it like a

(7:19:33) couple times and I wasn't It was

 You know what pisses me off if I'm if I'm with a girl and she's like like wipes

(7:19:41) before you like the smell

 You're a freak freak Like No but like she Okay we're getting

(7:19:48) like kind of graphic here but

 if she's like "Oh I'm embarrassed because I'm really wet." I'm like "Good What the

(7:19:54) fuck?"

 And she's like "Let me wipe some of that." I'm like "No what the [ __ ] are you doing?"

 We need that

 What the [ __ ]

(7:20:00) bro you know what I mean

 i don't know Anyways but

 slip and slide

 What were we

(7:20:06) talking about

 juicy Okay Wait wait wait But hold on You know what I mean though like I'd rather just

(7:20:13) not have sex

 Okay

 Yeah

 Chat do you know what I mean

 jade knows what I mean

 I know I don't have a penis Obviously

 I

(7:20:21) feel like women can feel this way Obviously Do we know

 couldn't women feel this way

 no I feel that way No but I'm

(7:20:27) wondering does it like I does it make it feel different for you as a guy like when you have it a condom versus like

(7:20:34) not obviously I think the answer

 Yeah it feels totally different

 Yeah it's

 just Anyways um so anyways moving on

 Uh wait

(7:20:42) Okay so in a 24-hour period four you had sex with

 probably four Yeah

(7:20:48) cuz sometimes it'd be the night and then the next morning I'd go and

 to the next dorm and

 dorm

 I mean there

(7:20:58) sometimes it would be like a frat house But but question like would you would you have to be kind of the aggressor

 no

(7:21:05) Cuz like I know it's easy for women to get laid but like that amount of volume

(7:21:11) like I think the woman has to be a bit aggressive about it

 Not too much It it

(7:21:17) was not that hard Usually you just talk to them and hang out and hey you want a drink oh yeah sure And then next thing

(7:21:24) you know

 would they make the move then most of like

 most of the time

 you never made the move It

 a lot of times they'd

(7:21:30) be like wanting to like do more and I'd be like "Well why don't we just do it real quick right here?" And then Yeah

(7:21:36) They they wanted to

 Did Did any of the men know that you were

 I was going to ask

 I don't know

 Did you have a nickname

(7:46:23) I think she had something to do with

 Can you read this one

(7:47:02) So yeah same thing

 We have golden question Wait what there it is

(7:47:09) Girl in blue pro uh proving black women are the most racist and delusional ever

(7:47:15) No wonder people leave the country for relationships and black women are the least matched on dating apps Is that

(7:47:23) true uh I think I maybe maybe it is I don't

(7:47:28) Okay

 Thank you Thank you

(7:48:16) Jay Nick it appreciates your message We have submersible

(7:48:23) honky earlier Chair 5 asked "What could a person of color say to a white person

(7:48:29) that would be racist?" How about I hate you because you're white

(7:48:35) i mean what does that hate do like are you hurt by it i I don't understand If it doesn't

(7:48:41) actually affect your life you're not hurt by it then it just hurt your feelings

 So what if a white person said

(7:48:47) that to a black person but there wasn't just a few weeks ago

 but there wasn't harm caused by it

 Okay But what about

(7:48:53) the woman who earned or earned I'm sorry who got all of that money from calling a little black boy on the playground the

(7:48:59) n-word i mean there are cases of it in reverse It was a child though you know

(7:49:05) and I don't know

 So you're saying it's only racist if it's one way

 Yes That's my perspective on racism and how it

(7:49:13) works Yeah

 What do you What do you think of white people i'm just curious

 I mean I'm half white I don't

 I know but like

(7:49:18) full white people

 Yeah I usually only date white guys actually Um I have a lot

(7:49:24) of

 That's really racist of you Why don't you date black men

 um I do date black men Mostly I've dated white guys

(7:49:30) recently But um I I don't feel any any kind of like

 I don't feel any hatred

(7:49:37) towards anybody I just don't like I I like all people and I'm not like I don't

(7:49:43) have any feelings of negativity towards white people my perspective on racism um

(7:49:48) is just what it is But I don't that doesn't mean that I'm bitter or I

(7:49:54) dislike or have contempt in my heart or feel like all white people are racist I don't think that those things about

(7:50:00) people and I don't make the assumption that they are I let people prove themselves to me by their character you

(7:50:06) know

 Do you think Jewish people can experience racism

 uh that um isn't

(7:50:12) racism What's the word um xenophobia right um my aunt was actually a baby uh

(7:50:18) um her whole family was uh killed um in Germany and um it was very sad Uh it was

(7:50:24) a horrible horrible situation

 But that's a racist

 Isn't there a Jewish race

 i

(7:50:30) thought

 as well as religion There's two Yeah But I thought it was called xenophobia I don't know

 That's for the

(7:50:36) country

 All right Well we're gonna we're gonna get

 How often have y'all heard that um Nazis like do people say Nazis

(7:50:43) were racist against Jews or do they say Nazis committed crimes against them i've I've never heard one person say Nazis

(7:50:50) racism

 They use the term like anti-semitism

 Yeah Yeah Yeah There That's the word

 We're going to move on though We have this one Jade if you can

(7:50:56) read it

 The fact that you think you can have a monopoly on definitions because you're black makes you racist The rest

(7:51:03) of the world isn't buying your BS Get your head out of your flowers you dumb racist

(7:51:10) All right we have

 That's not why I think I can say it I can say things like that I just have an opinion

 Sons of Liberty

 think the school she's going to work at might want to know about all of this The children's parents may not

(7:51:23) be comfortable with this type of mental instability and degeneracy teaching their kids That was for

 probably for me

(7:51:30) the one who's going to teach him But look you know I've met a lot of these teachers and let me tell you

(7:51:35) a lot of them are a little crazy You know what I mean

 Black person kills white person and says they did it

(7:53:37) because that person was white Not racist question

 I think that's for you again

 I

(7:53:42) I when did this happen i don't know

 It's a Let's say it's just a hypothetical

 or

(7:53:47) just South Africa right now

 Yeah

 It said when they do it and they say it's because they're white is it racism no

(7:53:54) It's still it's still bigotry and prejudice They judge them based on their skin Yes But

 what's that video of that

(7:54:00) guy with from South Africa with the red beret and he's like

(7:54:06) kill the boar guy

 Kill the whites or whatever

(7:54:46) This is an open platform for people to come and you know

(7:54:52) speak and we don't want to be some place where you know

(7:54:57) no snitches No snitches

 cuz they end up in ditches

 Uh this is just a thing

(7:55:04) but it's below the threat Oh you don't have to read it It's just below the threshold But uh guys it's $20 and up

(7:55:09) for a read or a TT Well it's not technically TTS Uh $20 and up for reads

(7:55:16) Uh okay let's get into the notes Libby we we haven't really gone to you too much So Libby we're gonna go over your

(7:55:22) notes here

 We have Oh man

 I'm trying to remember what I even said there

 You said

(7:55:29) you've gone on probably 50 to 60 dates Yes

 But very few of them have led to second dates

 And so is it that you

(7:55:36) didn't want to go on second dates they didn't want to mix a

 I would say mostly me but definitely the ones that I like

(7:55:43) wouldn't like me I mean it's the classic scenario of like

 I like everyone who doesn't like me and then vice versa

 The

(7:55:50) guys you like don't like you and the guys that like you you

(7:55:55) would say probably like

 most of those 50 to 60 plus were

 me not being interested

(7:56:02) for some reason Maybe it's values misalignment

 or something like that But

(7:56:07) yeah there's definitely been the opposite scenario as well

 50 to 60 first dates right though

 You said you once

(7:56:13) went out with a guy who said he was Christian but he also told you he loved doing shrooms within the first 10

(7:56:19) minutes of the date

 Yeah So this guy says he's a Christian and I think it was from Hinge and this was a really dumb

() 

(7:56:26) move but I went to his apartment and I shouldn't have done that cuz it was

 Did you do his laundry

 no I didn't

 Oh you

(7:56:31) should have It would have worked out Wife then right um in the first 10 minutes of the date he says his

(7:56:38) spiritual awakening came from shrooms And um basically he didn't believe in

(7:56:43) God creating the universe too And I was like okay So it's one of those things that's like mutually exclusive If you're

(7:56:49) a Christian and you then don't believe in God creating the universe it's like yeah it doesn't really

 you're not really

(7:56:55) you're not a Christian

 Um makes sense

 So then I had to like fake it the next hour and a half of just

 interest Tell me more

(7:57:03) about your letter You said you've uh never had a boyfriend

 Yes

 And you say uh which is surprising given that you

(7:57:10) describe yourself as a solid Christian and a conservative

 So why why do you think that is

 um

(7:57:18) probably a mix of like high standards and obviously like I'm not perfect either So

 um

 I have my issues

 What what

(7:57:26) are your what are your problems

 my flaws i mean I could probably lose like 15

(7:57:32) pounds or so Like that would help

 Sure Okay

 Um what else

 is there anything like

(7:57:37) personal more so personality though

 yeah I mean I in general I have strong

(7:57:42) opinions and I wasn't like super aggressive tonight but in general I think maybe that can be a misalignment

(7:57:48) of men thinking that I'm very like traditional which I am in my values but then my personality can be more like oh

(7:57:55) well this is just the right this is the truth

 and maybe too matterof fact

(7:58:01) potentially Mhm Okay Uh

 so they don't like being challenged

(7:58:07) that or just like the type of guy that I'm looking for is looking for someone who's more um

(7:58:14) agreeable

 Yeah

 Do you think that some of the guys that you've been on dates with that have turned you down have turned

(7:58:20) you down because you're a virgin and like you're saving yourself till marriage i don't think so because the type of guy that I would be interested

(7:58:26) in would also be at least open to that conversation and probably wanting that too

 So

 all right Uh what what would you

(7:58:36) say your bare minimums are in terms of what you're looking for in a guy

 what are the requirements for a guy

 so

(7:58:41) obviously they have to love the Lord as like a non-negotiable Um so like you

(7:58:47) should be going to a church A lot of these guys too will say they're Christian and then they're like not actively in churches Um and then

(7:58:56) conservative values generally you don't have to agree on everything but I think a general alignment of like okay if

(7:59:01) you're going to raise kids together you need to know that you in general have base core lines um aligning And then I

(7:59:10) mean obviously you want to be physically attracted to them as well like personality and that that can fluctuate

(7:59:16) a little bit depending on the person Um height's not a huge thing for me I'm 5'9 so I'm like kind of tallish for a girl

(7:59:23) but I don't really care as long as I'm not taller than them

 Okay Uh

(7:59:29) so when it comes to physical though you said height doesn't really matter

 Are there any physical things that you're

(7:59:35) prioritizing or

 I mean I find dark hair more attractive but I've liked different

(7:59:41) um types of guys So

 I think it's also like a personality type like someone who

(7:59:46) just Funny guys obviously are great Funny guys Good Okay

 Can I ask somebody

(7:59:52) sure

 And I'm just so curious because like obviously you're going to be dating hopefully to meet your husband and like

(7:59:58) you're not going to be like I don't know Are you going to like make sure

(8:00:04) he's like that you're okay with the situation in his pants before you lock it down

 cuz you're not going to have

(8:00:12) Wait Like can you elaborate like ask in a different way I think I know what you're going to get offensed Are you

(8:00:17) going to size yeah Like yeah Like like are you going to like

 You're not test driving the car before you buy it

 I'm

(8:00:24) not

 Okay

 She's waiting till marriage

 I know but like you know at least like like do I have fear about like what if

(8:00:30) it's bad

 or Yeah Or like

 I guess I mean I wouldn't really know any different right

 can I ask you something

 well not

(8:00:36) Yeah Yeah that's true And I think it's like so much more special then because only I'm not saying like having sex with

(8:00:43) them

 I'm saying like just you know maybe take cop in a field

 Maybe he wears tight

(8:00:49) gray sweatpants one day in the fall

 to just like see sizewise I guess I don't really know if that

(8:00:55) would matter Like does I don't know if it matters

 If it's too big it could hurt

(8:01:01) Yeah Yeah But also like if I find my otherwise perfect guy am I gonna no

(8:01:06) longer be interested because of that yeah that's a Yeah that's pretty much what I'm asking

 No I I mean I think that

(8:01:13) type of guy is rare enough that like that the the rest of that is minor

 to me

(8:01:19) Like it's it's going to work out

 once I get married and it might be rough at first but

 we'll figure it out

 You'll

(8:01:26) figure it out All right Okay

 Uh yeah But so you're you're a bit frustrated I

(8:01:31) guess because you haven't had a boyfriend yet and kind of struggling with dating

 Yeah I think it's just Yeah

(8:01:38) Again the ones that I like don't like me and vice versa So

 this is something super minor but I saw it quickly like

(8:01:44) because I look at people's IG profiles before you know

 as I'm prepping my show notes

 and I noticed uh you have quite a

(8:01:51) few photos with like random men on your IG and maybe they're just friends or

(8:01:57) whatever

 but this would be like just like a little minor thing that would take minimal effort that

 delete those

 or

(8:02:04) you could just archive them Like you could delete delete or archive them But I think that um it's such a minor thing

(8:02:11) that you can do like it wouldn't hurt to do it and it could help in some small

(8:02:16) capacity So that's like a little tiny drop of advice that you can do I appreciate that

 Um there's just all these random

(8:02:23) random dudes and maybe they're just like friends or like some dude you went to prom with or something

 Um I don't know

(8:02:29) if any of them are are guys

 Does it give like hoe is that the vibe

 uh no not like

(8:02:36) ho I feel like people

 for show but like guys even if these are like your male

(8:02:42) friends or whatever and you can tell them "Hey I've never done anything with these guys They're just friends." I

(8:02:48) think there's a component of like a guy just wants to see your your outward-f

(8:02:53) facing social media presence

 and it from a romantic perspective there's not other

(8:02:58) dudes potentially in the picture And guys will just jump to conclusions I'm not saying that's actually the case but

(8:03:05) the optics of it I would say it's really not gonna hurt you to take down that like three-year-old

(8:03:10) photo or whatever Yeah So I mean that's one little thing

(8:03:16) that you can change I guess that

 might have some marginal

 right

 pretty marginal

(8:03:22) imp uh change or whatever You said uh what's Let's see Men don't ask women out

(8:03:28) anymore Why why do you think that is i think part of it's probably Can you say corn is just corn okay I think probably

(8:03:36) part of that is they've they can get sexual gratification without talking to

(8:03:42) women anymore So like it does create this cycle of oh it's well why would I risk getting rejected if I can just go

(8:03:49) home and have that satisfaction um and obviously I think there's the element like women

(8:03:55) are responsible too and women have become more masculine more aggressive in a lot of ways And so then it's like did

(8:04:03) the chicken or egg come first i don't really know But I think it's a cycle of men and women not really properly in

(8:04:09) their roles in a lot of ways or like just generally in the norms of

(8:04:14) femininity and masculinity

 Do you think Only Fans is um damaging relationships

(8:04:19) i don't see how it couldn't And and not only for like I think it's for everyone

(8:04:25) involved society as a whole individuals who are partaking it and those consuming it

 Mhm

(8:04:34) Wait what's wrong

 she's like "Yeah I'm damaging relationships." Oh

 yeah No I mean no

 she's posting her

(8:04:40) butthole photos and it's just really

 Do you like buttholes cuz you keep talking about it

 It's just the go-to like

 Got it

(8:04:47) No I don't I

 I just mean if men are paying to chat to Only Fans models what's the point of asking a real girl

(8:04:54) who might reject you

 it's not the same though Like you can't really expect that the girlfriend or wife is going to be

(8:04:59) your girlfriend You know what I mean yeah But I think there's still an element of like they're getting satisfaction

(8:05:06) sexually without having to to make that risk to take that risk It's a high risk

(8:05:11) high reward scenario Men have been now trained that they don't have to do that anymore I think that's why it's damaging

(8:05:16) relationships because of that but also because like there's a lot of men that have girlfriends that are on OF or like

(8:05:22) wives and whatever

 Do you have a secret boyfriend that you're not telling us about

 no but I have a few boyfriends on

(8:05:28) OF

 You have a few boyfriends on

 Yeah like

 pay pigs or whatever that just send

(8:05:33) you money No

 Um you said that uh how Disney princess movies hurt women

(8:05:38) because it's given women unrealistic standards of love Any of any movies in

(8:05:44) particular i mean I think the classics they're they're great in a lot of ways but they just do create this expectation

(8:05:50) of oh my prince in shining armor is going to come and pick me up on a white horse And it's we're taught even

(8:05:56) inadvertently that if it's not perfect he's not the the right one

 And so don't make it work with him Instead wait for

(8:06:03) your prince who everything's just going to it's this feeling And love is not just a feeling love is yes of course you

(8:06:10) want to feel affection for that person but there's also like a choice every day choosing to love that person and like

(8:06:17) laying down your interests for theirs

 Is Little Mermaid is that is she a princess ariel is she a princess

 the dad's a king

(8:06:24) Is that is that one kind of is isn't Little Mermaid i haven't seen that in like

 she marries a prince

(8:06:31) for

 Is that one like a good one or no is is that one also kind of one of the Disney movies that's all [ __ ] up she

(8:06:38) gives up her voice in order to be with the man right

 she gives up her voice and she like I love that Wait let's watch

(8:06:45) this [ __ ] Little Mermaid

 right now The remake of the original

 Yeah

(8:06:53) Let us watch The Little Mermaid Okay Um Uh Okay

(8:06:59) What were the movies though in particular was it Snow White

 yeah Snow White Cinderella I think a lot of those

(8:07:05) classic ones and it I love them in a lot of ways I just think culturally it does have an impact on women especially from

(8:07:11) the time that you're like three years old watching these like it's indoctrinating you to believe a certain

(8:07:16) way about love

 Sure So you think Cinderella is is a bad example for girls

(8:07:22) i think the I don't think it's inherently wrong I just think it's like a truncated view of love Well for me

(8:07:28) it's like if you don't remember my face only that my my shoe goes in a very my

(8:07:33) foot goes in a very specific shoe You weren't looking at my face You weren't listening to me You don't care who I am I think that's a terrible example for

(8:07:39) women

 Yeah that's fair

 Yeah I don't think that taught us to

 you know wait

(8:07:44) for Prince Charming because he wasn't even looking at our face He was into feet Oh

(8:07:52) 50 60 dates though No luck No luck

(8:07:57) Yeah

 Standards too high possibly

 Yeah that's that's very possible Yeah

 is it

(8:08:02) possible

 um yes I mean I've had like I will say and I don't mean this as a flex but like within the last week seven

(8:08:09) seven different guys ask me or six ask me out to some extent not from Hinge or

(8:08:15) any dating apps But it's just a lack of I I guess maybe I have to get older to

(8:08:21) where I would my standards maybe need to be adjusted but I think that will come with age I guess

(8:10:41) with Straight into the

 I'm sorry He He was gay I was just the last one he was with

 Oh my gosh

 Yeah I got that going

(8:10:48) for me

 All right And you said you went through hell to land your now husbands

(8:10:53) Only because like I had said earlier he had a number of women in his life at

(8:10:59) that time But that that that was my fault I have to say

(8:11:05) he never was super committal you know Did he lead me on a little bit sure he

() 

(8:11:10) did But he wanted to keep me on the hook so he knew what he had to do You said that your uh your college boyfriend was

(8:11:18) gay after he dated you

 Yeah

 He left you at a Denny's in West Hollywood to go

(8:11:23) party That should have been clue number one

 But no you you write you're just

(8:11:28) uncool and don't get that all guys dance around in girls underwear to dep mode right

(8:11:35) Okay Good taste of music I guess

 Um anywh who you dumped his ass like a rock

(8:11:41) over the side of your boat

 I did And less than a year later a friend of mine while you're out hiking or out hiking

(8:11:47) with his girlfriend runs into him laying out naked with a bunch of dudes at some

(8:11:52) watering hole in the mountains Yesesh Yeah that was bad

 Damn

 That was bad

 Damn

(8:12:00) And wait so you uh you said this was in college right when did you graduate college

 um I didn't finish That was when

(8:12:07) I was at community college

 What years were you at

 uh that would have been 86

(8:12:12) 86

 86 87

 Damn people were and and people in back in the 80s were dealing with all

(8:12:18) this [ __ ] like

 that's why I would never nowadays if my husband left me I'm just getting a me and my cat

 you're just

(8:12:25) a nun it's over

 Yep Absolutely Yes Absolutely

 But do you think like uh well you you don't have any kids right

 no

(8:12:32) Okay Do you have any like uh maybe friends who have kids though

 oh yeah And I don't know if you like you know family

(8:12:37) friends or whatever but uh do you think dating has gotten worse

(8:12:45) i

 or was there a bunch of [ __ ] people were dealing with [ __ ] then 80s 90s

 but having the internet has just

(8:12:54) made it 10 times worse because if if a guy wants to get laid he just goes to

(8:13:00) Tinder There's there's no incentive to meet women anymore Like I I don't understand where 20somes where y'all

(8:13:06) meet guys Like we go to the club you know you get your girlfriends you get dressed you going out you're going to

(8:13:12) the club And now it's like I go I see these bars and there's nobody in them on

(8:13:18) a Friday night It's like where do these people meet i have no idea

 Got it You

(8:13:24) said uh dating topics you want to speak on You are not a princess and you are not a Kardashian Men are very simple and

(8:13:32) in no way complex As my mother always told me no matter how amazing a woman is

(8:13:37) if a man's not ready he's not ready

 So you're saying that you you think like a lot of women view themselves as

(8:13:43) princesses and you know they think they're maybe more than what they actually are

 i think the Kardashians

(8:13:50) have destroyed what women look at themselves and look toward men to be You

(8:13:57) know it's like I think there's a lot of girls out there that just want a sugar daddy and I just want to put my face out

(8:14:02) there and I want the likes and I want the money and they just want to be taken care of and they just don't really want

(8:14:10) the substance of a career or being a wife or being a mom or anything They just want to be taken care of

 And I I

(8:14:17) just I see that in a lot of girls

 You you also wrote here your final note

(8:14:23) modern dating makes you glad that you're old Seriously you said you you have no

(8:14:29) idea how these kids can possibly make meaningful connections when society makes it so easy to throw people away If

(8:14:36) you were single again like you said you would just get cats

 Uh your hot take is that if a woman wants to make herself

(8:14:42) feel empowered she needs to make her man a really good sandwich

 Yes

(8:14:52) absolutely There is nothing like making your man a good sandwich And I don't

(8:14:58) mean just any sandwich I mean you get a plate You get a real plate You don't put

(8:15:05) it on a paper towel You put it on a plate that has to be washed

 You cut it halfway down straight or

 diagonal

(8:15:13) It's cut on the diagonal And when I make my husband a sandwich I toast the bread

(8:15:19) I pile I put this pepper and the salt and poultry seasoning it up Oh I'll get

(8:15:25) the potato chips and I pour it on the side And then I get a little ramkin and I put some dip in it for him and I give

(8:15:32) it to him and I go "Here's your sandwich."

 And he just he bites into it and he goes "That's bomb." And I feel

(8:15:42) like I rule the world

 I know my man loves me and I love my man And nothing

(8:15:48) makes you feel more feminine than making your man a [ __ ] good sandwich All right Yep

 W

(8:15:55) Yeah

 There you go

 That's what you do

 Uh moving to Jade here Uh Jade you said

(8:16:03) that well we kind of talked about this You went you were here over a year ago Now you're leaning way more traditional

(8:16:10) more conservative and you like to make fun of Only Fans girls online

 Um

 Bonnie Blue mainly But you said you had a

(8:16:16) dating horror story The perfect man on paper Was this a guy you were dating when you were last on the show

 um yeah

(8:16:24) cuz you know on paper it's like okay tall fit um makes good money has a

(8:16:30) family that um is wellrounded Um so really on the outside you look in and you go oh what a what a catch Um but

(8:16:38) obviously everyone has their secrets And his dark side was his dark side was um yeah going to those

(8:16:46) little swinger events and

 well you said he was seeing three women per day rotating weekly That's 21 women per week

(8:16:54) Yeah

 Was this and this is the guy you were dating last time you were on the show or different guy

 no this was um

(8:17:00) actually one of the first people I'd ever dated Um and he was very wealthy He came from like generational money and

(8:17:07) has like a lot of lawyers protecting him Um and yeah he had a roster

(8:17:14) Three women per day

 Yeah

 So you were on the roster

 I Yeah I Yeah And then when I

(8:17:19) found out I was like "Okay well I guess I won't see you anymore."

 Damn

 Cuz I

(8:17:25) don't have a roster There were 21 women per week

 I don't

(8:17:30) know if they were all different or like I don't know

 the numbers but

(8:17:36) Good times That's

 I really know how to choose them

 Yeah

 Yeah

 Good times Good times Uh let's see here We have Leah

(8:17:44) Leah finally She's been waiting to talk so much She's from Cuba

(8:17:53) One of the better Spanish-sp speakaking countries You know Cuba

 Oh

 I guess Just kidding That is that bad

 What's the

(8:18:00) worst one uh I don't know

 Probably Spain They have the leis Oh they're the colonizers

 I

(8:18:07) don't know Uh okay You said your gay best friend turned by and confessed to

(8:18:12) you after you showed him your

 your what

(8:18:17) i put the emoji cuz I don't want to say the word

 The You put the what

 the emoji Which emoji

 i'm a [ __ ]

(8:18:25) Oh so you're saying you had a gay best friend Yeah And then you showed him that

(8:18:31) and then he turned by

 No no no no He was like by and we were like brother and sister Okay And then he I don't know I

(8:18:38) just happened like oh do you want to see okay There you go And then I was really like shy but I

 There you go

 Yeah I

(8:18:44) wasn't prepared

 Did Did you Were you standing when you did it

 i was

(8:18:50) just like take a peek buddy What do you think

 but I felt very like this is not something sexual like he's not like

(8:18:57) getting off this or anything But then it turns out he could have been cuz he liked me But I didn't know Oh

 he was

(8:19:03) like your brother

 Did you Did you guys hook up or

 No but we tried like we date for a little bit

 You dated a gay guy

(8:19:11) Oh okay

 I went to an art school So like Wait you said that you hooked up with your aunt's cousin at her wedding

 Wait

(8:19:18) aunt's

 Isn't that

 Is that aunt's cousin your second cousin

 that's

 No he's not

(8:19:23) related to me you guys

 What the [ __ ] they asked

 Why did you do that

 i just

(8:19:28) made up with him I just made up with him Is she your is she your biological aunt or like auntin-law or something

 half

(8:19:34) aunt She married my like my stepdad's brother though So it's kind of like

 But her biological cousin you hooked up with

(8:19:43) yeah we just made out I was young I was like 16 He was like 10 years older than me But like also um

 it was Cuba So this

(8:19:51) is all okay in Cuba

 Um we just like made out That's it

(8:19:56) He's not related to me What's the problem they're first cousins so it's fine

 We're not first cousins They're not

(8:20:02) related Wait you said you said uh you want uh saving yourself for marriage That was

(8:20:08) one of the things you wanted to speak on but you're not saving yourself for marriage

 I'm not but I feel like it's

(8:20:13) something that people should do because there's like a pressure of like losing your virginity Like when I was in high

(8:20:19) school like there was that where like come on I don't know if any

 the pressure

(8:20:25) I didn't Who who here at the table believes that she's a virgin

(8:20:31) oh thank you guys Thank you

 23 She's 23 right she lied about her age

 No

(8:20:38) didn't If you guys care I'm actually 22 but

(8:20:45) like uh Okay And then uh you said 50/50

(8:20:51) relationships You're like against 50/50 I guess

 Yeah

(8:20:56) Why

 okay you won't you do off Won't take the guy's last name

(8:21:04) I think you got to do 50/50 Like that's seems fair

 Also the cousin thing

 Also the cousin

 He wasn't my cousin

 They

(8:21:11) asked for stories I don't have a lot of stories I had like four stories

 Tilt your mic down the chin

(8:21:17) Uh okay

 Why is the cousin about that bad horrible I don't think here's look when

(8:21:24) it comes to this these OF girls wanting men to pay for first dates

(8:21:29) chivalry by the way chivalry is dead women killed it but chivalry

(8:21:35) if you want chivalry you have to be a lady and if you were an only fans girl

(8:21:41) you're not a lady I just feel like you're putting again putting it in the box putting people in

(8:21:48) the box

 yep you're right that's exactly what I'm doing Right

 But you're you're literally you guys want the lady

(8:21:54) treatment You want the gentlemanly treatment but you're not holding up your end of the deal You guys are not ladies

() 

(8:22:01) I feel like I am because that's why I'm not even trying to date because how am I supposed to date somebody and do this work you know what I mean like I feel

(8:22:06) like

 your cousin

 I didn't date He wasn't my cousin He was my cousin actually Fact

(8:22:12) So a traditional man who is chivalous is going to be chivalous to a lady who is

(8:22:18) also traditional that's what he's going to want as a traditional man And what Brian's saying is being on Only Fans and

(8:22:25) not wanting to take his his name doesn't make you traditional That's what he's

(8:22:30) saying There were things I would do sometimes in life and my mother would be like "Would Princess Diana do that?" No she

(8:22:37) would not

 Oh I don't do that all the time

 Yeah

 Now I throw it at my co-workers I'm like "Kate Middleton

(8:22:43) would never look like that to be true." Just look just say that you're modern women and just be like you know what but

(8:22:50) well here's the thing right is that even though you guys are modern women you're not traditional You can still get guys

(8:22:56) to simp for you Like guys will still pay for your dates

 I'm not denying that

(8:23:01) there's guy like you'll find dudes who find you attractive who will pay for

(8:23:06) your date But I'm looking at it from a bird's eye view of looking at the entire

(8:23:12) scenario looking at the chessboard and I'm just saying that's unfair Like that

(8:23:18) seems like a bad deal right

 i think like also like being a lady isn't that like

(8:23:25) how you act in person and I think if someone's judging you like from the

(8:23:31) basis of just like looking at oh she has an OF she's not a lady or she's this or that I mean every guy I've dated is

(8:23:38) super chivalous and respectful but I mean I think it also comes from a

(8:23:46) a a area of respect And if you get to know the person they don't respect themselves

(8:23:52) Like the guy's probably not going to respect them either

 Well but okay So

(8:23:58) what about this though so a guy who's a massive player could treat you really

(8:24:04) nicely He could treat you really nicely but he's going to be sleeping with a bunch of other women So even though he's

(8:24:11) like in person he's treating you well There's this other

(8:24:16) other behavior that's happening which is not

(8:24:22) if you're a traditional woman for example you like mo traditional women are

(8:24:27) not really going to allow for well I guess I don't know there's like

(8:24:32) different religions where like polygamy or whatever but traditional women are typically not

(8:24:38) going to tolerate infidelity right um at least in a monogous culture even if you

(8:24:43) treats you really well

 Mhm

 So in this case you guys could treat the guy really well and be tra although she

(8:24:51) I mean you guys I don't know don't want to take the guy's last name Don't you don't want to take the guy's last name

(8:24:58) You say you're traditional You're not Okay that's the And what are you guys submissive probably not You probably

(8:25:04) want to call the shots in your relationships So it's like okay how are you traditional

(8:25:10) you're not Just say you're modern women Like just be modern Be modern women Just

(8:25:16) say I'm a modern trumpet

 Trumpet

 And you know what i'm okay if the guy

(8:25:23) wants to be in the cuck chair Just say that I'm okay if the guy wants to be a cuck I'm okay if the guy wants to go

(8:25:28) 50/50 And you know just accept it

 No not that one Not the last one but the second

(8:25:33) one is okay

 The [ __ ] chair You're fine with the cuck chair

 I'm sure there's some who enjoy it so yes I'm fine with

(8:25:39) it I'm just saying

(8:28:49) Ken

 Karen

 Is that your real come on That's your real name This is the third time you asked

 I have autism That's my

(8:28:55) bad

 People are different Uh uh dating pool these days is rough men

(8:29:01) are not the same as they were 10 to 15 years ago The bar is set so low That's

(8:29:06) what you wrote Why do you say that

 i think like I don't know I I think it honestly goes back to

(8:29:13) like chivalry is dead because I think like a lot of guys just in the instant

(8:29:20) gratification that they can get from women they can just like I don't know go hook up with a girl if they want to have

(8:29:26) sex and just like hit her up and then be done with it Like Netflix and chill But it's like there's no like actual like

(8:29:32) dating So it's like to get to know someone substantially um and actually have like a long-term relationship I

(8:29:38) think it's a little bit difficult And I think

 where like when I was in college in 201 like 10 11 that I just feel like

(8:29:47) it was a little bit different with like dates versus it is today It's just changed a lot So and I think the bar is

(8:29:55) set low because women allow themselves to date men that don't

(8:30:01) treat them well Like I don't know

 Okay You said that

 they get used to

 some of these OF girls are all hat no cattle but

(8:30:07) you're you're using your career to establish yourself invest buy property

(8:30:13) take care of your family and give back to your community

 Yeah

 How are you giving back to your community with your

(8:30:20) OAF stuff i actually started a nonprofit Um and yes and we give back to I helped

(8:30:29) over a hundred families last year We donated over $10,000 half of which was my own And we were there like probably

(8:30:37) seven days a week for like every single day for like a hundred days Like we had we're out there helping

(8:30:44) everyone So I I personally you know like to help my community in that way and

(8:30:52) anything I can do I volunteer sometimes too So I just I don't know I have I

(8:30:57) think that you know yes I'm in this industry but at the same time I like to

(8:31:03) help support my family give back and at the end of the day if I know who I am on

(8:31:09) the inside and if my family can love me and like I don't really care if like

(8:31:15) some people stereotype me cuz I know who I am You said that you're close with your family best friends with your dad born

 is he Catholic

 i mean he was confirmed

(8:32:21) Catholic He goes to church like every Sunday but he's in a like a non-denominational

(8:32:27) wait the non-denominational Catholic

 No he so Catholic He was confirmed Catholic before and like

 but now he goes to

 he's

(8:32:34) like a non-denominational Christian I guess is what you

 but he goes to church every Sunday

 they yeah him and his like

(8:32:41) girlfriend

 do you go to church oh your parents your parents are separated okay

 um

 oh wait

 well

 did

(8:32:51) what sorry whose mom somebody's mom passed

(8:32:56) away did some

 H mine was that your

 was Yes

 Oh okay Sorry

 The other person

 Yeah

(8:33:04) my bad

 Um but yeah um

(8:33:09) I think I grew up like you know going to Catholic school and just kind of having

(8:33:16) religion for lack of better terms like kind of forced down my throat Like just kind of like

 wait are you still

() 

(8:33:21) religious

 i believe in God Are you Christian

 i would say I have

(8:33:27) Christian beliefs I go like I enjoy watching like non-denominational like churches as well

 And but you said

(8:33:33) your dad is is he he's a non-denominational Christian

 Mhm

 And he he goes to church

 Yeah

(8:33:40) And he's okay with you being a sex worker

 I mean that's a really blunt way to put it And I think there's a spectrum

(8:33:46) of girls on Only Fans I've said it like a lot but like they know who I am They know me And it's

(8:33:52) like I think if you're going to say like I'm a sex worker so everyone that was in Playboy is a sex like was a sex worker

(8:33:59) Like how

 Yeah I agree I agree with you There there's differences between a woman who's like a prostitute on the

(8:34:05) street versus a woman who posts like tasteful lingerie photos on the internet

(8:34:11) Um but I mean do you post nude content no

 You don't put Come on You don't post

(8:34:18) nude content

 no Do you post content that's sexualized i'm

 Yeah

 Okay

 I mean

(8:34:25) you you can put a girl in a bikini I mean someone could sexualize me in the dress Like you know what I mean

 right but is your is your content sexually

(8:34:33) provocative

 yeah of course Yeah

 Like you're twerking You're like doing poses

(8:34:38) that are of a sexual nature

 I mean that's of reach but yeah I mean at the

(8:34:43) end of the day it's like I just think it's just a small part of my life Like I'm not a really

(8:34:51) sexual person I would say But

 And you're being honest like you don't post nude content

 What do you mean by like post do

(8:34:58) you mean like share or po like I'm not like

 is there have you taken a photo of

(8:35:04) yourself that has been distributed in any capacity through Only Fans or some other adult website where your breasts

(8:35:11) are exposed

 yes

 Exposed Not just like no no top Okay What about

 I didn't do that

(8:35:17) below the waist Is there anything where your hoo-ha is out like no I I mean are you going to like I

(8:35:27) mean

 are you I've done I've done Are you telling the truth

 yeah I am I'm trying to say like I mean I've done I've taken

(8:35:32) pictures like without like my panties on but it's not like like that angle you

(8:35:38) know so I don't really know if you can like you know because a lot of girls come on the show

(8:35:45) they claim that you know they they do this tasteful stuff comes out you know

(8:35:50) after the show they're doing like hardcore content or whatever

 I don't have any I mean all my

(8:35:57) stuff is solo and I don't do any like hardcore stuff So

 like what is hardcore though like

 well I mean it

 I mean he

(8:36:04) thinks Only Fans is hardcore So

 like if somebody were to Google your name

 and be

(8:36:09) like try to find the leaks or whatever would it come up with I'm not saying

(8:36:14) they should but would it come up with full nudity

 i'm just laughing cuz um

(8:36:20) there's actually a real porn star and her name is Karina Hart and so half the

(8:36:26) time that's pretty cool of her So

(8:36:32) uh okay

 But I just I guess look what I'm trying to get at here You say you're you

(8:36:38) believe in God from from like a Christian lens kind of

 Your dad's a

(8:36:43) Christian He's your manager So I I assume or is that manager

 is that the

(8:36:49) term his title or whatever so he's uh assisting and facilitating

(8:36:56) you in producing content that is intended to create lust in men Lust is

(8:37:01) one of the seven deadly sins It seems like it would be sort of how do you reconcile uh being Christian

(8:37:09) uh and but also being on only fans That's my confusion I mean you can turn

(8:37:16) the table against like certain doctors and their careers and if that's morally

(8:37:21) like what they what they procedures that they do

 in Asia What are you talking about

 i I'm talking about like like

(8:37:28) doctors who are like perform abortions and things like that Like are they going

(8:37:33) to help for doing their job i mean I would say that if you're a Christian and you're like an abortionist

(8:37:41) that's probably not reconcilable within the Christian faith Uh so

 right

 I would

(8:37:48) probably also question like how do you reconcile your Christian worldview with

(8:37:55) uh doing abortions or whatever

 right yeah But so back to you Uh

(8:38:02) bit of a red herring there Uh how do you reconcile being involved in sex work having your

(8:38:09) dad involved in it he's a Christian I guess you're kind of a Christian

 I think like just the person who I am at the end

(8:38:16) of the day and like I'm a really nice person I give back to my community I I

(8:38:22) feel like

 well murderers do

 if you just don't Right But I feel like if you

(8:38:29) I don't know on like on paper besides like if you just take the job out of it

(8:38:34) like I know who I am I know I'm a really good person and I'm not going out murdering people

 Well let me ask you

(8:38:40) this Uh two final questions I guess Uh do you think God wants you to be making

(8:38:47) porn

 porn

 porn

 adult content um I mean I

(8:38:56) think I'm using what God gave me in a good way So it's like Robin Hood right

() 

(8:39:04) am I like stealing i'm not Robin Hood Robin Hood pictures is what like is like

(8:39:10) what robin Hood

 She's the You're the Robin Hood of shaking your

 Are you Christian

 i love it No

 Are you Christian

(8:39:17) yes I was uh My dad was a speaker at our church my entire childhood I've read the Bible back to front front to back

 Oh

(8:39:24) sorry I didn't mean to press that

 I was raised Christian but I'm no Christian I So you're Christian Okay Uh well so hold

(8:39:31) on Do you think God wants you to be doing adult content

(8:39:36) i think because at the end of the day I'm using it for good Like I think that I'm giving

(8:39:45) using the most of the gifts that God gave me But I think if I

 just answer the

(8:39:51) question Just answer the question

 No Biblically considering like knowing wants you to be doing

 Well what's your

(8:39:57) definition of God it's probably like you're It doesn't matter what my definition is I could be an atheist

 If

(8:40:03) you're talking about if I'm comparing to like God

 because you said you believe in

(8:40:08) God right

 is it the Christian God

 i mean I believe in like a creator of the

(8:40:14) universe And

 is it it

 I would say I has more Christian

 Whatever your sense of God is

(8:40:21) do you think God wants you to be doing Only Fans

 yes or no just give me a yes or no

 I think for how I'm using it yeah

(8:40:30) I mean I don't think that like a Catholic god or like a like biblically

(8:40:36) no The answer is no And I think that's what you're digging at You want me to say no But I'm saying like biblically do

(8:40:42) you think do I think it's like against what like most Catholic and Christians like preach and talk about yeah But I

(8:40:52) think that there's some gray area personally I don't know

(8:40:58) And then uh what what do you think Satan wants you to be doing

 i don't want anything to do with Satan So I don't

(8:41:04) even think about it I don't think about it

 God wants you to be doing adult content Then would Satan want you to not

(8:41:10) be doing adult content i don't care about what Satan thinks

 No

(8:41:17) I know I'm just asking you So if it's the case that God wants you to be doing what you're doing then it would be the

(8:41:22) case that Satan wants you to stop doing Only Fans

(8:41:30) I mean I don't want Yeah I don't want I don't

(8:41:36) really do you think I'll

 one one more thing I just want to pose it to her Uh

(8:41:42) you said that you are Christian Which denomination into the

(8:41:48) mic if you can

 I grew up a a Christian just Christian Um

 non-denominational You

(8:41:53) said your father was a pastor or

 he was a speaker at our church So we had three speakers at our church It's a small area

(8:41:59) where I live

 Uh do you think God wants you doing adult content

 i think God gave us freedom of choice for a reason Um we

(8:42:06) have the ability to do anything in this world And

 do you think God wants you to murder

 i don't think he wants us to

 You

(8:42:12) have the freedom of choice to murder

 If he could stop us why doesn't he so I

(8:42:18) mean he lets everyone make their own choices Our decisions are something if you're going to do something you need to

(8:42:25) stand firm in it And that's what I do I do what I do for money And

 so just really simply um yes or no Do you think

(8:42:33) God wants you to be doing adult content um yeah I mean if I'm gonna say yes or

(8:42:38) no I would say yes God wants me to have the freedom of will

 What What does Satan

(8:42:44) want you to do

 i don't believe in Satan actually If he did exist though would Satan want

(8:42:49) you to be doing adult content or not want you doing it

 i I just don't believe in uh

 All right You had something

 I'm

(8:42:55) sorry

 Yeah Well I guess I just wanted to say like God wants to know you and love

(8:43:00) you and it's not just about following these rules but it is about like the

(8:43:06) point of the gospel is we are sinners All of us me included and I need Jesus

(8:43:11) And it's about going and sinning no more though It's not about perfection cuz we're never going to get there But it's

(8:43:16) about he was perfect I am not But I will try only by the power of the Holy Spirit

(8:43:23) to move towards that sanctification And so that is it's hard like it might mean

(8:43:29) giving up only fans but I think it's something that if you you know read the gospels and pray about it like I think

(8:43:36) he will reveal more and more of himself to you and it's not again about these rules It's about being in communion with

(8:43:43) him and having him know you and love you and the way that he does

 It's beautiful

(8:43:50) Good talk Good talk Okay Um I want to kind of jumping off of that I like to do

(8:43:56) a call to action at the end of the show to the one two three only fans girls

(8:44:02) here at the table Like to use this as a moment an opportunity to give you a call to action

(8:47:06) I'm not saying you're perfect but you know Liy's living a very virtuous life

(8:47:11) so they're still going to find something wrong So it's like I feel like I finally got to the point where I was like I'm

(8:47:18) kind of like sick of like trying to meet certain criteria for guys and they're

(8:47:25) either going to accept me as I am or not And why would I really want to be with someone who wants to change me like and

 I thought it was an area

 A woman who has many casual sexual encounters or relationships

(8:51:21) That's the That's the actual like dictionary definition

 Ohm

 Yeah

 Oh we dictionary earlier Now you're pulling it

(8:51:27) out

 You know

 can you define racism

 let's go back

 We got Wait if I type go

 please

(8:51:35) cuz I tried earlier

 Here's the here's the definition according to the dictionary Oxford languages dictionary

(8:51:41) Prejudice discrimination or antagonism by an individual community or institution against a person or people

(8:51:48) on the basis of their membership in a particular racial or ethnic group

(8:51:56) Sweet Also the belief that different races possess distinct characteristics

(8:52:01) abilities or qualities especially so as to distinguish them as inferior or

(8:52:07) superior to one another

 Does it say there that you can't be racist to white people that's the definition

 Does not

(8:52:13) say that

 Not yet

 Not that

 Not yet

 We'll change it I guess

 Tonight

 All right We

(8:52:19) have Kyle Hold on Uh actually really quick can you guys uh

(8:52:24) guys like the video if you enjoyed the stream this was kind of a longer stream tonight We did unfortunately start a little bit on the late side Mostly

(8:52:31) mostly due to some technical difficulties we're having before the show Um PCs man there's just always

(8:52:38) always something If you guys can go to twitch.tv/ whatever pull that up Guys it's been 1 hour since we had a prime

(8:52:45) sub We still got 1,100 viewers over there on Twitch a couple thousand on YouTube So if you guys can drop us a

(8:52:51) quick follow and just check if you have a Prime sub available if you have Amazon Prime you can link it to your Twitch A

(8:52:56) quick easy way to support the show every single month Okay we have a few more chats coming through If you can read

(8:53:02) these

 Yes sir Okay own up Who the [ __ ] is subbing to these averagel looking

(8:53:08) talentless bums on of the mental gymnastics here trying to reconcile faith with being a prostitute is

(8:53:14) impressive try the Olympics I don't think any of us here are prostitutes I mean the definition of a prostitute I

(8:53:21) mean right well some people would just say a prostitute is somebody who sells sexual

(8:53:27) services for money right i just think in my mind it's like someone who's like

 bucks and you

 Well

(8:53:34) here would be like here here would be kind of the framing that we could use to frame you guys as prostitutes So you'd

(8:53:41) agree if you went into a hotel room with a guy and you never touched him but you like exposed your breast to him and he

(8:53:49) was like uh pleasuring himself Would you agree

(8:53:54) that that would be prostitution well I mean that sounds like a strip club Is that I don't know

 Well it's a

(8:54:01) private room and you go into the private room with him and then you expose your breast to him and I don't know he meets

(8:54:08) you on the street or something and he's like "Here's 50 bucks." And he's going to pleasure himself and you're going to be in the room with him and he's getting

(8:54:15) off to you exposing your naked body to him Would that be prostitution

(8:54:20) prostitution Yes

 Okay So the only difference is is you guys are putting it behind his screen basically

 Technically

(8:54:26) that's what makes it legal cuz as long as you're recording in Canada you can do it But if you're just doing like sex

(8:54:32) without camera that's illegal in Canada Well I'm not even talking about legality

(8:54:37) I'm just talking about how we're defining prostitution So it's like okay

(8:54:44) if the only difference here is you're doing it behind a screen I mean

(8:54:49) yeah

 but then we have the sex worker thing

 Yeah there's also that Okay we have ALB coming in here If you can read

(8:54:57) this one Oh did it not that's weird Uh let's try that again Okay try that

 No

(8:55:03) one can serve two masters Either you will hate the one and love the other Or you will be devoted to one and despise

(8:55:10) the other You cannot serve both God and money Yep

 I agree with that

 We have Spaxs here

(8:55:16) if you can read this one Thank you Spaxs Why would any self-re respecting man find a morally bankrupt OF woman

(8:55:23) attractive imagine introducing an OF girl to your parents Dad this is X She

(9:00:29) we take off All right guys Guys if uh if you guys enjoyed the stream kindly like

(9:00:36) the video If you enjoyed the stream like the video

 Uh I'm pretty sure we hit

(9:00:42) pretty much everything Oh Um Leah you said women are just as physically strong are just as physically

(9:00:50) strong as men Yeah depending I feel like comparing me to you I would say no But

 say no Okay

 I

(9:00:58) I don't know Like do you want to arm wrestle or something but I think you would win like logically

 I know I really

(9:01:04) confident

 Huh

 so okay But what are you trying to say what What's your position i was trying to say that like you could

(9:01:11) get a woman that's about the same weight as you or you know what I mean the same physique and that she would be able to have like more strength than you

(9:01:17) possibly like the world's strongest woman but generally speaking

 but what makes a

(9:01:24) woman weaker than a man like other than like oh I'm smaller than you that's what I was saying

 uh muscle but generally

(9:01:30) speaking

 about the muscle

 okay yes women have muscle but generally speaking are

(9:01:36) men stronger than women

 I Guess

 you guess

 it's just not super obvious to you

(9:01:45) Damn this girl agreed with all our [ __ ] things That's crazy

 Me

 um yeah

(9:01:51) So but explain it to me So generally speaking though like if I were to say I

(9:01:58) don't know I'm just throwing out a number It's probably more 90% of men are stronger than all women Would you agree

(9:02:04) with this

 i guess Okay All right There's not then I don't know if you really

(9:02:11) meant to circle that I guess But

 I feel like

 women can't be sexist towards men Why is that

 rapid fire

 Did I say that

(9:02:19) Why do you agree with that women can't be sexist towards men I don't even think I understand that to

(9:02:24) be honest

 I I It's English language barrier I get it

 Uh wrong to refuse to

(9:02:30) date a transgender person because they're trans Why is that what is a woman

 did I say that can I get that paper back i don't think

 this girl Yeah

(9:02:36) we're going to publish this She has a bunch of

 It's wrong to date I feel like it's a choice

 It's a choice

 It's a

(9:02:42) preference You're fine with people having preferences So if I didn't want to date a transgender woman you're okay

(9:02:47) with it

 Yeah Seriously

 because she's trans

 That I feel like maybe I would judge you but that's your like right

(9:02:53) Okay You would judge me but you'd be like "Okay." Would it be wrong though like you would you would then say he

(9:03:00) should date her

 But like why would I force you to do something you don't want to do

 no you wouldn't force me But you're like "He should date her." That's

(9:03:05) not forcing

 I feel like in this society everybody has their own opinions You know what I mean

 okay But it would be

(9:03:10) wrong for me to not want to date her because she has a penis

 No I guess

 she has a giant penis and I don't want to

(9:03:17) date her because she has a giant penis

 I feel like it just makes you like be more into like what is that word like

(9:03:23) physical stuff like Uhhuh

 Uhhuh Okay Uh all right A man

(9:03:30) dating a transgender woman is straight according to you Yeah What

 that's It's not straight But

(9:03:36) anyways if she's a woman if she's a woman

 we'll have you back on the show and we can argue about it more Okay guys

(9:03:42) If you enjoyed the stream like the video We have one chat coming through here from Chaw Damn Can you uh read this one

(9:03:48) Jade for us

 yes sir The washed out Marxist prostitute wants a million dollars a year What a shock

(9:03:55) The list of things more marriageable than her starts with a rock and only goes up from there

 A million She wants a

(9:04:02) million dollars a year I feel like she was being honest though

 Yeah I was

 No but that's the bare minimum

 You know what i want a 10 out of 10 Victoria's Secret

(9:04:14) model virgin giant labia Black

 Black

 I've dated men who make that

(9:04:22) and more I mean I don't think that Where's the ring

 uh in my house I already told you about that earlier You

 You'd be surprised You would be

(9:04:34) surprised

 Um but it's like I you got to understand as women right she dated NFL

(9:04:43) players She dated athletes She dated famous actors famous musicians all this stuff It doesn't dated right slept with

(9:04:51) Let's be honest slept with It doesn't really mean much

(9:04:56) if you're not in a committed long-term relationship And ultimately if you don't

(9:05:01) have the ring you don't have that real long-term commitment

 Cuz it's easy it's

(9:05:06) easy as a girl to just sleep with a guy right

 and maybe keep him around for a couple weeks a couple months whatever it

(9:05:12) is

 especially if your name's Carrie Especially Especially

(9:05:18) but I'm telling like this I So you're saying well I have dealt with men who make this

(9:05:25) much money

 Not dealt with I've dated for several years men that made that kind of money Yes I have It's not I don't know

(9:05:50) lot of respect for the person that I'm with I tend to date wealthy men Um it's

(9:05:56) always just happened for me I don't know what it is about me but yeah I just feel
