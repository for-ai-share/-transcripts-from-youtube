(0:01) [Music]
(0:08) [Music] so I didn't really prepare an opening statement or anything but from what I've
(0:16) been hearing from voters this election the main issues are the economy and immigration um and I think Trump's
(0:24) immigration um plans are not only not going to uh help our our country but
(0:31) they're also going to contribute to the current inflation and uh uh downfall of
(0:37) the economy uh so I'm going to be getting into that a lot tonight uh
(0:43) Trump's tariffs are something I really want to focus on uh that are I think are
(0:48) going to be devastating um so yeah that's what I'm I'm just going to start with fair enough thank
(0:55) you Ghosty process to you yeah I think uh we look at these two
(1:01) different candidates kind of looking at two different visions of uh the future of America and I'm definitely on the
(1:06) side of uh Vice President Harris and Governor Waltz uh I think have a a new
(1:11) way forward looking that's going to be addressing a lot of the issues I think are more relevant to like the average American i think issues uh for the
(1:19) middle class I think are already handled talk about some specifics uh there's a
(1:24) lot of part of the campaign they have uh they've already created over uh 70
(1:31) 700,000 new fan manu sorry manufacturing jobs comparing that to the a lot of the
(1:36) manufacturing jobs are lost under Trump uh there's going to lower prescription drug costs i think that's going to be a
(1:42) big impact for the average American sorry there's some background sound
(1:47) they're also going to be cutting taxes for over 100 middle 100 million middle class workers i think when you just look
(1:53) at all the policies that they're both proposing I think one of them is going to be uh way better results for the
(1:59) middle class and so I'm on the side of of them and that's kind of driving my vote thank you so much process flow
(2:06) state to you and I'm on nobody's side um I don't vote i think that voting is a
(2:12) placebo activity and uh what we're allowed to have is two crappy candidates
(2:18) who are both actors and that debate is allowed to rage fiercely but just within
(2:23) a narrow margin think that the voting system entirely is is it keeps us from it keeps people mind
(2:33) locked and it gives them a placebo activity so they feel like they're engaging uh and making change and doing
(2:39) something when really they're just watching made for TV drama and wasting their time while the world around them
(2:45) moves without them thank you so much Andrew to you
(2:51) yeah so uh thanks by the way to to the entire panel for uh for coming on and
(2:58) engaging in this debate i appreciate it it's day before an election i think that these conversations and these debates
(3:03) are super important of course thank you to Sarah the Tomato for having me on i would advise the Crucible crew as is
(3:09) usual to support the people who support us make sure you go over and generate uh
(3:16) or I'm sorry uh generously donate for um for her channel very kind for her to put
(3:21) these panels on with that said I am voting for Donald J trump because he's awesome and Harris is a piece of [ __ ]
(3:28) lying scumbag prostitute by the way complete uh they call her heels up Harris for a reason she blew her way to
(3:35) the top she's a worthless piece of human filth i can't wait to see DJT knock her
(3:42) out tomorrow and watch all of you progressives cry rivers which all of you deserve by the way can't wait to get
(3:49) into the tariff policy which you guys will cry about it's going to raise prices oh my god it's going to raise
(3:55) prices i can't wait to shove that down your throat too in 5 seconds by the way
(4:00) I just wanted to point out that you're exactly what I what most people would envision the normal progressive voter
(4:07) looks like right which is exactly what we're voting against we're like "Oh well the thing is is that I'm really
(4:13) committed to Harris because because why why nobody's excited about her policies
(4:20) what is she gonna do oh we're gonna build some [ __ ] houses oh yay that's gonna really invigorate the economy i can't wait for that you're not gonna be
(4:26) able to point to anything you're even excited about you just don't like the orange man cuz he's bad i don't like the
(4:32) orange man cuz he's bad so you're going to bring up that Donald J trump is immoral oh yeah fair on his wife can't
(4:38) wait for the moral arguments to shove those down your throats be a bunch of people who don't give a [ __ ] have no
(4:43) standard for morals but suddenly they're going to clutch their pearls when Donald J trump is coming into office didn't
(4:49) give a [ __ ] when Clinton was getting a [ __ ] in the Oval Office stuffing cigars up one of his interns vaginas and
(4:56) then smoking them democrats couldn't wait to defend that guy but suddenly with Donald J trump he's a monster it's
(5:03) all ridiculous and it's all derangement and it's all designed around one thing i
(5:09) don't like Donald Trump and I don't like Donald Trump and the orange man is bad and that's it that's all you got and I
(5:15) guarantee you as we get into policy you guys are not going to be able to defend Harris there's no [ __ ] way she's a
(5:20) loser worthless loser always has been a political loser nobody likes this chick
(5:26) by the way for people who love democracy so much you can't wait to go and vote for a chick who was never democratically
(5:33) put there she was literally not democratically put there nobody voted for this chick to be the president for
(5:39) the Democrat party nobody she just happened to get installed there because the president you did vote for that you
(5:46) lied to us about for years saying that oh this guy's faculties are there DJT
(5:51) came out and completely wrecked him in a debate and he barely had to say anything this guy [ __ ] his depends live on stage
(5:58) we got to see it and finally the Democrats were like well perhaps perhaps after all of that it's time for old Joe
(6:05) to go even though we all knew he was scenile none of you gave a [ __ ] you were willing to have a deep state run the
(6:10) entire entire government uh for this guy who you claimed wasn't scenile and put in a woman who nobody even wanted there
(6:17) so yeah I'm happy to get into this debate i can't wait i'm going to jump right into if that's okay
(6:23) go ahead the floor is open love how it's starting off very good faith andrew are the progressives in the room with you
(6:30) right now because I think you're kind of seeing some things progressives are I'm not progressive so I don't know who
(6:35) you're really addressing already people here in the virtual room with me right now yes you're a progressive
(6:43) no I don't consider myself progressive where do you guys stand on abortion you consider yourself progressive i guess
(6:49) you're not then all you have to do is just not consider yourself a murderer and I guess you're
(6:55) not then do you like UBI she got me you like UBI
(7:01) and are you pro-choice i am pro-choice
(7:06) i think we need more research on UBI so I don't have a strong opinion yet
(7:12) pro-choice as well would we like to go down the rabbit hole of progressive and the definition or do
(7:20) we want to move let's start with tariffs right because she wants to get into tariffs
(7:25) let's get into tariffs ghost let's do it let's start with this question how would Ghosti president of the United States
(7:32) tomorrow uh possibly defend us from low-wage unskilled workers in China who
(7:37) are currently building the components which are necessary for our defensive missile systems without utilizing a
(7:44) tariff in order to equalize the playing field can you explain that to me i don't ask Trump because he doesn't seem to
(7:51) have any idea how she brought up labor we're arguing policy last I
(7:56) checked so let's argue policy let's get to it okay um so not all tariffs are are
(8:02) a terrible idea i think ex specifically with China that's that's fine to tariff
(8:08) China but Trump his favorite word is tariffs did you guys watch his did you watch his Bloomberg interview
(8:17) okay and you could stand behind what he said in that interview he was that he wants massive tariffs on almost every
(8:22) country yeah he was a bambling idiot he wants 10 to 20% tariffs his solution to everything is tariffs he wants to
(8:29) destroy the chip act the chip act that literally bipartisan everybody loves he
(8:34) wants to get rid of the chip act and just put tariffs on everything raising all the prices getting rid of the demand
(8:41) by the way because if he's going to um deport all the immigrants we're going to have a lot uh less people building these
(8:48) products and making these these jobs so it's going to increase inflation just naturally that's what happens when you
(8:54) have too much demand and not enough supply sorry getting rid of the supply that's basically Okay well can we start
(9:00) with one claim at a time let's start with the raising of prices from the tariffs right so you're you're making
(9:05) the claim that his tariffs are going to raise prices on the American consumer correct obviously yeah okay and what's
(9:11) going to happen with uh uh Kla Harris when she raises corporate taxes
(9:16) is that going to raise prices on the consumer you think it's the same effect
(9:22) answer my question and without the white knight simp jumping in so go ahead answer my question that'd be great it's a four person panel i think you can
(9:28) handle it that's great um we're having a discussion at the moment let her answer the question it will also raise prices
(9:36) but uh it it doesn't have the same effect as as prove it prove that
(9:42) corporate taxes corporate taxes are just hidden taxes for the consumer they're hidden taxes for the consumer you're
(9:48) going to raise taxes on corporations by 30% to try to raise revenue who the [ __ ] do you think pays for that who pays for
(9:54) that ghosty who pays for the Yeah who pays for a 30%
(10:01) tax increase on a corporation when the corporation then necessarily has to increase we're not against We're not
(10:06) against We're not against corporate tax hang on i would like an answer to my question i want an answer to my question
(10:12) can you answer i'm answering it right now if you want to listen for a second I just want an answer to this and I'm gonna give you the question i want you
(10:18) to actually answer the question I asked not some [ __ ] you make up that's tangential to the question I ask you who
(10:25) pays who pays when corporations raise the prices on goods because you raise
(10:30) tax on corporations who ends up having to pay who
(10:38) what's the matter you guys Google fingers broken are you you can't Google You can't Google quick enough oh you
(10:44) never thought of that oh never occurred to you you she's paying for these things by uh
(10:52) raising taxes on uh Uhhuh paying for what things and and the corporations
(10:57) paying for what things for for the other uh tax credits and
(11:04) everything else yeah but who's paying for that then if corporate taxes go up
(11:09) necessarily the consumer has to uh pay for those taxes right Ghosty but they're
(11:15) getting more money back how who is in tax credits who the the uh
(11:22) middle income and lower income classes what tax credits her her her tax credit plan what tax
(11:29) credit what are you talking about the only tax credit that she's offering up is a $2,000 increase in the earned
(11:34) income child credit same as Trump he's offering the same exact thing except Trump is offering to keep it in
(11:40) permanently she's only offering it for the first year first year baby and then it goes down to 3,900 what tax credits
(11:47) are consumers getting not just child tax credits i'm talking about she's going earn income right okay go Steve let's
(11:54) try this okay let's say that there's a company that makes Snickers bars that's what they do they make a Snickers bar
(12:00) right now a Snickers bar at a store let's say is a dollar okay and what
(12:05) happens is the end user buys it for 90 cents okay and he sells it he makes a 10-cent profit now that same store owner
(12:13) has to buy it for 95 cents and still wants to make a 10-cent profit who has to pay for that end user to make that
(12:21) profit who um the consumer oh the consumer so
(12:27) when you tariffs when you say prices for tariffs are going to raise the uh prices
(12:34) on goods for the consumer so are corporate taxes the nice thing about a tariff though 6% instead of 20% you're
(12:41) muted dude it's really funny to watch a spur though it's really funny to watch a spur when you're muted the tariffs are
(12:47) more refined to specific industries whereas corporate a corporate tax increase is going to hit everything equally no well he's putting a 10 to 20%
(12:55) tariff on all US imports every single US import yeah he's trying to equalize China
(13:03) what the hell was that hold on somebody's got a
(13:10) Who's Who's got the echo
(13:16) mic check mic check test test test i'm good okay thank you sorry guys
(13:26) you okay there Ghost steve do you guys need to take care of some tech issues real quick is that what's going on and
(13:32) I think if I remember correctly Donald Trump was proposing matching tariffs for
(13:37) countries that charge us tariffs correct yeah this is correct so not only is it a protection tariff good what so here's the difference in policy go yeah here it
(13:44) is here's the difference in policy with a protection tariff like you just said you believe in tariffs because that can
(13:50) level the playing field with countries like China donald Trump agrees those same tariffs that you support right now
(13:57) raise necessarily the prices on consumers okay great right you say I
(14:02) believe that that's okay the distinction is is what Harris wants to do is instead of having these rich ass importers have
(14:09) to pay for the uh taxes from these other countries that are raking us over the coals she says "Nope we're not going to
(14:15) tariff that even though it's an uneven playing field instead what we're going to do is raise corporate taxes so now
(14:21) our own domestic corporations have to pay massive taxes which then the consumer has to pay uh the rising cost
(14:28) in goods from corporations having to having their taxes raised and we don't
(14:33) get the benefit of the even playing field against our trade adversaries we don't get the benefit why do you like
(14:39) tariffs again why do you like them again Ghosty why do you like them only for China because of their uh First of all
(14:46) we're trying to like No not just China you want them against Russia right you want them against Russia too don't you
(14:51) uh I don't know necessarily about Russia you don't know if you want Do you want free trade with Russia ghosty why would
(14:57) you want them against China alone um it's mostly like for correcting their behavior so they have a lot of uh
(15:06) ju just like their testing testing one two yeah we got you i think you're good their work ethic is like people are like
(15:14) dying uh they're also they're trying to outrun us in the economy so we're trying
(15:19) to they're trying to be the number one exporter which like they are and we're trying to compete and we're running a
(15:24) massive fairly treat their workers they literally sell things for next to
(15:31) nothing which makes it hard for American companies to compete with whereas the rest of the countries in the world like
(15:36) we don't need to do that let's just raise it only hurts consumers which country so you don't think that we
(15:42) should have any protectionist tariffs against South America who do the exact same thing really
(15:49) question let me answer the question before you jump in and I'll answer yours mine
(15:57) there's a specific industry that needs to be that that like shows like a
(16:03) benefit to adding a tariff but having broad tariffs across the board just for no reason makes no sense it's not for no
(16:10) reason it's because economist is against it no by the way absolutely not not only is every economist not against it but
(16:16) the same economists who are against it are the same ones who predicted that Donald J trump was going to crash the stock market like Paul Kugman before he
(16:22) was ever elected and exactly the opposite happened on top of that uh what you're talking about is a surplus versus
(16:28) deficit the United States is running a trade deficit with tons and tons of
(16:34) these different nations that we have these free trade agreements with like South America who also treats their workers very poorly just like China does
(16:41) and the entire point of it is to offset these deficits meaning you spend a million dollar America invests a million
(16:47) dollars in you you invest something back in America which is equal to that or at least on par with that that's not what
(16:53) they're doing that's why free trade these free trade agreements with these countries suck there's no way for you to offset it so we can get our industries
(16:59) back without the tariff all you want to do is raise corporate taxes now process all right can I ask a question go ahead
(17:05) thank you thank you sorry about the audio issue sorry I left you hanging for a while ghostly there but I'm curious do you also disagree with most most
(17:11) economists where like it's okay to have a specialized economy we don't necessarily have to build everything in America
(17:16) most economies by who yeah let's talk about let's talk about a specialized economy uh so yes perhaps we don't need
(17:24) to build everything in America the idea of free trade is supposed to be that every single country is competing
(17:31) against every single other country in order to make prices go down uh here's an example of this toyota in the United
(17:36) States toyota brought in cars which were a lot cheaper okay the and Americans were able to buy these cars for a lot
(17:42) cheaper and so what happened is American industry auto industry had to make their cars a little bit more compact they had
(17:48) to make them a little more durable they had to make them a little bit better to compete with Toyota and the rest of
(17:53) these countries that made these rice burner vehicles right that's what we call them so the thing is here's the
(17:59) problem if you have a country who's doing that right and is doing it fairly across the board investing as much in
(18:05) your country as you are in theirs that's fine and that does make prices go down nobody's upset with that but they don't
(18:10) do that they cheat what they do instead is they go "Now we're going to start to monopolize this industry for profit for
(18:17) our own nation by putting tariffs on your [ __ ] goods and running a deficit with you right we get the surplus and
(18:23) you get the deficit." That's [ __ ] and that's exactly what needs to be corrected and instead of you generating
(18:29) revenue by correcting that from the importers and exporters you want to raise corporate taxes instead and make
(18:36) sure that the consumer us gets completely decimated in the grocery stores when the
(18:42) price repeated like five minutes ago goi said
(18:47) she's okay with uh like causing a difference with being like tax cuts or taxing people thing is there's going to
(18:54) be way big of a difference when you do the tariffs versus when you are doing the trade deficit with almost every nation that we trade with sir do you
(19:01) understand that they're running a surplus and we're running a deficit with almost all of them almost everybody we have a free trade agreement with we have
(19:08) the deficit they have the surplus so already Trump is trying to
(19:13) correct that immediately and all you want to do is go "No I don't like him i have no offset policy for this except
(19:19) tax [ __ ] corporations Democrats ever want to do i'm not even opposed to like some of the
(19:25) policies you're proposing things this is not what Trump has been talking about trump's talking about across the board even like saying
(19:31) a,000x,000% tariffs in certain cases where so like it's way more he proposed
(19:36) 20 to 30% increases you can't trust what he% also he proposed 20 to 30% increases
(19:44) across the board no he said a thousand% yeah if you if you want to have a domestic industry for your automotive
(19:52) workers so that they can compete with countries which are running massive you just said what's exaggeration no running
(20:00) no 20 30% is what he's talking about across the board and he's talking about what you're talking about is hyperbole
(20:07) right you're being very disingenuous he says 20 to 30% across the board if you want to protect if you want to protect
(20:13) your own automotive workers okay then what you have to do in order to compete
(20:19) with other countries which have tariffs against your own automobiles is put your own tariffs back on them in order to
(20:26) make the playing field even or else what happens is they use a tariff against you they run a surplus they get the money
(20:33) you get the deficit me you and Ghosty have to pay that [ __ ] deficit we pay it that's nice that's not how it works
(20:40) out though he we he tried this with washing with washer washing machines he
(20:45) tried to put a tariff on all washing machines thinking that it would help American washing machines ended up
(20:51) creating like 1,800 jobs but it also added like $1.6 billion to um American payers so
(21:01) the amount of money that it costs per job is is just not worth it okay you
(21:08) first of all when you look at the Chinese trade war also raised American dryer uh washer American dryer driver
(21:14) prices they were going to raise anyway they raise every year that's one and two steel and
(21:19) aluminum just so you know we'll explain it to you so that you
(21:25) understand okay a trade war is going to take 8 n 10 years it doesn't take three years okay in the the trade war with
(21:32) China what was happening is the steel industry they were running such a surplus Plus we used to have the finest
(21:38) steel industry in the world we had the top 14 steel companies in the world in
(21:43) the United States in the 1980s and 1990s we were the best the very best the North
(21:49) American or not the North American but the China free trade agreements completely destroyed it what they did
(21:54) was they started to compete with us in the steel industry and tariffed our steel we did three times more damage to
(22:01) their economy than they did to ours in that steel trade war and yes did we have to knuckle under right and assist our
(22:08) own steel industry yes of course we did we did that as well with farm subsidies
(22:14) we do this to our own industries all the time we subsidize them to make sure that they can compete abroad but we don't
(22:19) want to be running these massive deficits and surpluses with other nations that's insane that puts us at
(22:25) risk especially these companies then which can use this the steel microchip processing technologies things like this
(22:32) which go into our weapons systems we cannot depend on them if we go to war with them we're in big [ __ ] trouble
(22:38) we have to have a way to protect ourselves from that tariffs are the only way we should be focusing on like the
(22:43) jobs like where we get the chips whereas like maybe some more like base level jobs like making steel where it's a little bit easier we can outsource SAS
(22:49) outsource that to countries where it's cheaper and we can take that and we can use that for more complex something more
(22:55) complex that's more valuable why do we need to do that when we don't have to why do so if you have
(23:02) an industry you can point to where you say we have to outsource this because we can get it for because we can get it for cheaper and then we can sell it for more
(23:07) when we turn it into something else we couldn't get it for cheaper when we had the best steel industries in the United
(23:12) States here steel was cheap not only was it cheap but we had Why did we in the first place because you dumb asses on
(23:19) the Democrat side decided that you're going to open up free trade agreements with countries that free trade minimum
(23:26) wage to do it you like were batting their their feet to do these open trade agreements they wanted to do this no
(23:33) Democrats pre-Obama and and Clinton especially they're talking about the 80s yeah clinton clinton no that Clinton was
(23:40) 90s you [ __ ] turd but anyway you were talking about the 80s a second ago talking about the case in the 80s that
(23:45) you brought up in the 80s and 90s brought up 80s and 90s I said you just don't understand cuz you're dumb but
(23:51) anyway pre-Clinton when you look at Clinton especially who did the North American Free Trade Agreement pre him
(23:58) Democrats were the ones who were screaming that we needed protectionist tariffs so that we could protect our workers so that we could protect our
(24:04) unions and you [ __ ] sold us out totally sold us out and now you're allowing these other countries to run
(24:10) massive surpluses on our backs and all Your answer is is well we have so many unfunded liabilities and we will refuse
(24:17) to tax imports and exports that what we're going to do instead is we're going to tax our corporations our own
(24:23) corporations that's [ __ ] crazy it's crazy everyone agrees so again the cor
(24:29) the corporation tax is going from 21 to 28 that that's what her plan is and
(24:34) again like I don't fully agree with this i think that's like a little too extreme but it's definitely not as extreme as
(24:41) Trump's tariff plans but there's no reason for us to believe she'll only raise it to 28% there's zero reason for
(24:46) us to believe that trump was the only one who gave us a corporate tax cut we should not believe that Kamla will only
(24:51) raise 28% how would you be able to offset sign hold on hold on hold on
(24:57) andrew let her finish we should 100% because first of all uh a lot of people are kind of worried about Kamla raising
(25:04) uh the corporate tax rates and in order to get that passed she needs to actually like get it signed through the house and
(25:10) the senate and everything whereas Trump can do this all through executive action he doesn't need to get things signed so
(25:16) the Democrats can like we don't even know for sure if Kamla is going to even be able to get that passed whereas Trump
(25:23) 100% is going to get these tariff he can do that himself good it's preferable to have tariffs in place in order I lit I
(25:32) literally just explained this to you 15 times you agree with tariffs for the same reason I agree with tariffs you're
(25:38) saying that countries you don't treat that seven times that way difference
(25:44) okay dummy then explain it to me using words how are you going to raise the
(25:50) revenue to take care of our unfunded liabilities if you do not tax imports
(25:55) and exports on tariffs and how are you going to levy the playing field against other nations who are running surpluses
(26:01) against us in that which is almost every nation go ahead i'm all ears well what we're not against tariffs like
(26:07) fundamentally we're against crossore tariffs that's what we're against yeah I'm not against tariffs what industries
(26:12) do you think should be exact there can be there can be good terrorists like are you do you not I think we are should be
(26:18) exempt from tariffs yeah what do you want exempt from a tariff it would be easier to talk about what shouldn't be
(26:23) exempt from tariffs i know you want to tariff China but what what you don't want across the board tariff so that
(26:29) means you want something excluded what do you want excluded yeah what like every like everything like how it is now
(26:36) there's there a way better policy is to do like a like a choose what is what is it be
(26:41) tariff rather than just being you know everything that comes just across the board we think a better policy that would have a better economic effect
(26:47) would be to like examine it on like a product by product basis okay well let's just talk about something simple bananas
(26:52) from South America bananas from South America do you want to tariff them or not tariff them
(26:59) is there a Yeah because they're running a massive surplus which means we're buying way
(27:04) more of their produce than they're buying ours who cares so why don't we tear off So why don't we go ahead and tear because we don't want to run
(27:11) massive deficits and trade with other countries because that's [ __ ] that's why the reason Trump wants
(27:18) tariffs is to bring jobs to America right uhhuh right okay so what kind of
(27:23) jobs are what kind of jobs is he going to bring to America if we're not going to uh be trading with other countries
(27:31) anymore we are going to be trading with them what are you talking about the consumption of the US if we made
(27:38) everything if you start tariffing bananas we start growing bananas in mass America
(27:44) consumption we still have the same consumption within the US so whether it's made abroad or whether it's made here they're still the same demand yeah
(27:50) what are you talking about he's still going to be trading with everybody a protectionist tariff does not mean not trading that's the dumbest thing I've
(27:56) ever heard literally that is one of the I argue with professional prostitutes who make better arguments than this is
(28:03) [ __ ] crazy what are you Okay how is How is he going to stop trading with other countries that's insane they're going to make other countries not want
(28:09) to trade with us how are they going to not listen we're the central reserve
(28:14) currency in the biggest economy in the world they want to trade access to our market we're not we're targeting countries where we get cheap where we
(28:21) get cheap goods that's the problem that's going to have the What cheap would you like to continue to get
(28:26) anything from China what do you support slavery steal from China
(28:32) if it ends up being cheaper and we can turn it into more valuable products afford that and we and what about the steel that we want to use for our
(28:38) battleships and if we have them for our battleships which frees up trade for the entire world you want us to continue to
(28:44) buy it from a trade adversary again weapons things like like everything is a
(28:49) material that processes weapons i agree there should there can be tariffs on those don't you understand that that
(28:56) falls under every category that falls under salt that falls under that falls under reserve or that falls under uh
(29:01) preservatives that falls under spices that falls under anything the United States military would need for its soldiers it fall everything is for
(29:09) national security military national security us producing
(29:14) our own goods here in house is always going to be optimal in comparison to producing them abroad even in a
(29:21) specialized way who's going to do all these jobs what do you mean Americans are going to do the jobs what do you mean we have like what one of the lowest
(29:28) unemployment rates in history yeah the way they calculated you know it's way better again this is going to be this is
(29:34) going to be creating more demand and not enough supply oh that's terrible inflation on top of having an Uber
(29:40) driver for 13 hours a day based economy where you drop off cheap [ __ ] all day you'll be in a steel factory with
(29:46) awesome benefits making $40 an hour oh it's [ __ ] terrible oh my god we're gonna transition from a service-based
(29:53) drop off cheap [ __ ] to your door economy to a place where there's actually turning factories where people can make
(29:58) a living that's terrible that's awful this is this is another LAR this is like another repeat of like his first term
(30:04) when he's like saying "Oh we're going to bring back all the all the mining jobs." And look what happened none of that happened his first term do we have any
(30:09) more like we violated the mining industry
(30:14) first of all first of all Obama killed our coal industry by trying to put they they put in a bunch of these acts trying
(30:21) to wind and wind and solar oh wind and solar joe Biden passes his his inflation
(30:29) relief act has nothing to do with inflation whatsoever it was all a Ponzi scheme to put it into solar and put it
(30:35) into wind and put a bunch of money into these industries promising us that we would by the end of his first term have
(30:42) access to some of the cheapest alternative energy on planet Earth we [ __ ] don't democrats are lying to
(30:48) your ass they shut down your coal mines they shut down your natural gas they shut down everything they can shut down
(30:53) for because of global warming and as it turns out they cannot offer us alternatives where's all my [ __ ]
(30:58) electric cars Ghosty where's my electric truck where the [ __ ] is it where is it the most drilling and oil production
(31:05) than we have ever in history by under Biden instead instead of making sure
(31:11) that that industry can produce those materials in in the cheapest way possible to the market what we did was
(31:18) we taxed the [ __ ] out of them which is why you're paying more at the pump because they said we're going to instead
(31:24) of investing in our own oil industry we're going to instead invest in electric and solar where's my [ __ ]
(31:30) Where's my electric our own oil industry that's why we're producing more oil than we've ever than we ever have instead of
(31:35) investing instead of investing in our oil industry and subsidizing the [ __ ] out of it which we should have done instead of that he passed the uh the
(31:43) inflation relief act and almost all of it went to alternative uh energy sources under the promise that we would have
(31:49) electric vehicles charging stations everywhere where the [ __ ] are they where are they this is a this is a red herring under Biden US oil and natural gas
(31:56) production hit like all-time records so what are you talking he's done better better than Trump biden did better it has to do with
(32:04) Biden has nothing to do with Biden has to do with the fact that they're alternative energy resources that they invested in have been a [ __ ] failure
(32:11) that goes to my point not yours just because everybody wants to buy gas and oil
(32:17) it's no it's no worry then it's going to keep it's going to continue to be the case under the case under Harris it probably
(32:23) be better under Harris if you look at at least the stats bro they put a trillion [ __ ] dollars into alternative energy
(32:30) and we don't have it instead of making it $2 $3 gas like Trump did that's what
(32:35) he did remember when we had $2 gas i wasn't under [ __ ] Biden where's my electric car princess where's my
(32:41) electric remember when we had like a $150 gas under Obama oh man why did
(32:46) Trump raise the gas prices godamn it i'm through the [ __ ] roof too what are
(32:52) you talking about gas prices go up there was a global inflation
(32:58) they were about $5 under Obama a gallon no [ __ ] that Let me Let me just point
(33:03) we've never had more energy independence than under Biden so energy independence this all this is all a win for Biden
(33:09) this is all a lot of these are all extensions of Trump policy trump bought up the oil topped off the n the national
(33:16) oil reserve he invested heavily in oil and coal people have the demand right now for tons of oil so you see the sales
(33:23) going through the roof that's even we don't have to worry about this because it is not stop it though it doesn't
(33:29) matter it's going to continue under invest in oil and gas to make it cheaper for the American public he invested in
(33:36) alternative energy that's the case why are we at all time production under Biden why is it the case because
(33:43) demand go ahead name a policy that Biden passed that made the demand for oil high
(33:48) stupid go ahead affected the demand yeah or the supply
(33:53) no the demand that's where we got the supply we have an increase in supply because of the demand name a policy that
(33:59) Biden passed that increased the demand for oil dummy i feel like it's not really relevant to
(34:04) my argument you're saying you're saying we should we shouldn't vote we shouldn't vote for Harris it's going to be it's
(34:09) going to be disastrous for oil for the oil industry there's no reason to think that yeah so let me get this right so
(34:15) the demand shoots up through the roof and because of that a lot of people buy oil and you say "Well that's that's because of Biden." And I say "Okay well
(34:21) then go ahead and name the Biden policy that causes me to not a concern there's
(34:27) not one there isn't one we we like [ __ ] i can't believe I
(34:34) explain this." So five minutes ago you brought up how like it's a red herring they're like "Oh we had to worry about about Democrats being super into green
(34:40) energy." I'm I'm bringing this up by saying we don't have to be worried about oil continuing to be a thing under under Democrats they are okay with oil and uh
(34:48) fossil fuels being used and it's gonna we're gonna keep using them all it's fine we don't have to worry about that yeah right what happens when the
(34:53) corporate tax goes up on these oil companies as uh as Harris proposes who
(34:59) ends up paying for that sir so wait there are some uh maybe some
(35:04) legislation thatffecting the oil industry just to answer my question when she raises the corporate income or when
(35:10) she raised the corporate tax rate across the board as she's proposed who ends up on our domestic oil companies who's
(35:17) going to end up at the pump paying more money the consumer yeah if that even ends up getting passed which it likely
(35:24) won't get passed yeah great but you know what i would love for pass again this is way less It would be the consumer
(35:31) tariffs it's way high how do you know what okay what tariff's going to raise oil prices 6% compared to 10 to 20 to
(35:38) 30% which one's a higher number that's not a one one knucklehead that's not how it works you're raising You're directly
(35:46) raising the lord i can't believe I have to explain this to you do you think you think it's a one to one that if you have
(35:51) a 10% tariff on a good that that's like increasing 10% on a corporation that's insane that's not even in the same
(35:57) universe so let me ask you this let me ask you this guys i just got I got to know i got to know a higher number no no
(36:04) no but a higher it might not be one to one but a higher number means paying a higher cost right so no matter what if
(36:11) there's a higher percentages on the tariffs that means higher cost to the consumers okay so let me get this right
(36:18) your issue with Trump is that Trump is going to put in tariffs that are going to negligibly raise the cost of goods in
(36:24) order for us to compete with people who are taking advantage of us in a surplus versus deficit relationship of free
(36:31) trade where they put a tariff on us you say you're for those tariffs which are mainly the ones that are being proposed
(36:37) but instead of doing that instead of doing that you want to raise corporate taxes which you admit also are going to
(36:44) raise consumer prices makes no [ __ ] sense whatsoever and now answer my question please as you evaded if Harris
(36:52) raises the tax on on corporations domestic oil corporations by
(36:57) 10% who is going to pay more at the pumps who i I said consumers consumers
(37:03) disagreed that's going to impact the price of gasal with you guys so why is it that I need to go vote for a chick
(37:09) who's essentially promising that all the prices of goods including my gas prices are going to go up tell me why that's a
(37:15) good idea because it's gonna go up higher under Trump probably prove it exactly if that oil price are going to
(37:21) go up higher under Trump don't Okay I don't know about gas in particular but Goldman Goldman Sachs i'm not going to
(37:28) I'm not even I'm going to say Goldman Sachs i'm about them even Goldman Sachs estimates there's going to be bigger job
(37:33) growth under under Harris oh you trust Goldman Sachs i don't do you you seem like you might uh you trust Hang on you
(37:41) trust a megala investment firm which literally will invest hundreds of
(37:46) thousands of dollars on both sides of the aisle Democrat and Republican so that they can hedge their bets because they're a massive stock broker you trust
(37:53) Goldman Sachs you trust that Goldman Sachs has Main Street interest in mind or do you think that they have
(37:58) investment interest in mind who do you think that Goldman Sachs is looking out for main Street cuz they're a faking
(38:04) company and they hold a bunch of people's money so they probably hear about both goldman go see Wouldn't they be more
(38:11) worried about corporation taxes than tariffs no listen there's two types of taxes
(38:18) would affect them more so so you would There's two types of elites no no no first of all it's answering your question why don't we let go finish
(38:24) makes no sense i'm asking a question and cutting them off when they answer makes no sense what you just said makes no
(38:29) sense doesn't mean I'm trying to make the counter argument okay there's two kinds of elites okay you have you have
(38:36) one type of elite who operates in the business class you have another who operates in the investment class
(38:41) democrats are trying to protect the investment class elites those are the ones that don't pay any [ __ ] taxes at all those are the megala billionaires
(38:48) and what all all of those policies way out way do way better for the sens
(38:56) well you keep cutting you keep cutting us off i wanted to give I wanted to give ghosty the floor actually since she did
(39:01) get cut off on that one so I just want to say like that is part of her proposal that's the reason she's doing this is
(39:07) because lots of the bigger uh you know millionaires and billionaires do get to evade taxes and through her plan they
(39:13) wouldn't be able to escape that anymore with this uh corporation tax and um
(39:19) there's one other thing she wants to tax for people who make more like over like a hund00 million or something it's a way
(39:26) so that they actually have to pay their taxes oh it's at the gains uh the unrecognized gains tax yeah yeah yeah
(39:33) just just so that just so that you understand right because I can tell that both of you are extraordinarily naive uh
(39:39) I'm going to try to help you out here uh do you know what a lobbyist is
(39:45) yes what is it they're people who basically they're kind of like
(39:53) uh what's the word they they kind they kind of represent corporations and uh kind of explain their special interest
(40:01) yeah they represent special interest groups now do you think that lobbyists work for the mega rich or for Main
(40:08) Street i mean as a as someone on the left I don't like love uh love lobbyists all
(40:14) the time but I do think they have they have they have their they have their purpose yeah i'm asking you a question do you think that they usually represent
(40:20) the mega rich or main street the megalo rich yeah omega rich and so what happens
(40:25) is these lobbyists right they go down and they have their own lawyers and their lawyers actually craft legislation
(40:30) and then they bribe politicians and what they do with bribing politicians they say "Look your next re-election campaign
(40:36) we're going to put x amount into a super PAC and this super PAC is going to run uh all sorts of propaganda on behalf of
(40:43) you to make sure that you get elected this next cycle." That's what we're going to do they already pre-craft the legislation do you love this these are
(40:51) not the only thing stop bro let me finish bro you think that these that these megala billionaires who are from
(40:58) Goldman Sachs who are sending in lobbyist groups who literally send them to Republicans and Democrats with pre-crafted legislation are ever going
(41:05) to allow them to tax actual mega billionaires no [ __ ] way that's the
(41:10) most naive stupid thing I've ever heard they literally craft loopholes into the legislation so what these people can do
(41:16) is this what they do is they go "Okay I don't have any assets whatsoever what I do is I take out a billion dollars in
(41:22) loans and I live off the loans i never have to pay a capital gain because I never made a capital gain i've never made a single gain so they never pay any
(41:29) [ __ ] taxes we get it come on make a point they never pay any taxes kla
(41:35) Harris saying that billionaires are going to offset her economic disaster of charging corporations at 15 employees uh
(41:42) an additional 10% which then is going to go to consumers like you yes yes look at her corporate tax yes 15 employees right
(41:50) under do you understand that almost done with the point
(41:57) i know okay stop hold on because you guys have been interrupting each other left and right so Prawn if you could let
(42:02) him finish and then I will pass the mic straight to you so what's happening is this she's going to put it on Main
(42:09) Street corporations okay that's what's going to happen the people that you actually work for and what's what that's
(42:15) going to do is it's going to stop you from getting your raises and it's going to raise your prices you've already admitted you're going to raise the
(42:20) prices at the pump you've already admitted that it's going to raise the prices to the consumers in the stores you just don't [ __ ] care and then you
(42:26) say "No it won't because the make of billionaires for the first time in history are going to pay their fair share." Get a [ __ ] grip dude get to
(42:33) reality wait you think Well hold on the floors let Let Prawn have the floor i
(42:38) told him he could have the floor and then honestly being super good faith we already addressed this way way earlier
(42:44) at least in our opinion at least at least a simple worldview where we think there's gonna be way bigger effect from terrorists than the corporate taxes so
(42:50) you can just ignore our our our view but we've already we've already addressed that i'm proving [ __ ] prove it come on
(42:56) Andrew yeah I let you finish come on let me do it too and I'm happy for the back and forth but you definitely you
(43:03) definitely tend to like gish up and talk for way longer than everyone else so that's why I tend to interrupt you a little bit more um but I think you'll
(43:09) see a response as well wait and somebody has to keep the conversation moving wait so you think that corporate taxes are
(43:15) affecting small businesses they're not no no her tax plan specifically are not affecting small
(43:21) business it's for businesses that make over a certain amount of income what is the amount
(43:27) off the top of my head I don't know but it's like you don't know you can't see the debate you don't even [ __ ] know it's not small businesses prove it and
(43:33) small businesses buy their inputs from large corporations exactly and not only that what you would consider to be a
(43:39) large corporation often would be conflated with a small business right prove what now you just made a statement
(43:44) you said that Donald Trump is going to raise consumer prices more than Harris we both have agreed that consumer prices
(43:51) will slightly raise under tariffs which you guys agree that tariffs are good with me you just don't agree that he's
(43:56) going to raise them by 20 or 30% but you have not demonstrated how much that's going to raise prices on Main Street
(44:02) versus the corporate tax so tell me as you have made the bold claim now that Harris's corporate tax increases though
(44:10) you agree are going to raise consumer tax you say it's going to be less than the tariffs prove it while we sit here
(44:15) and enjoy a drink as you struggle and can't because you're lying through your [ __ ] teeth
(44:22) i already explained this first of all um prove it can repeats
(44:30) i I mean like you can't prove it either you can't prove it i didn't make the claim you made the claim prove it so the
(44:37) like economists all agree that 28% is the highest you can go before investors start getting worried about uh you know
(44:45) investing their money into these where you reading this from by the way ghosty where are you reading it from
(44:50) uh I don't know maybe it's like the Wall Street Journal or something i I saw a whole bunch of economists agree on this
(44:57) mhm so you can't press Wait a second but I just want to make sure that we're clear
(45:03) that your claim that Harris that Trump is going to raise consumer prices more
(45:09) than Harris that you can't prove that i just want to make sure that I got that correct you can't prove that right so if you again so if he's adding 10 to 20 to
(45:18) 30 plus% on on consumers and again it's not like a one for one but if that
(45:23) percentage is larger than the 6% of a corporate tax then that's obviously and
(45:29) yeah that's what's in dispute that's what's in dispute so we're just ready for you to go ahead and prove it whenever you want i I got some dead hair
(45:36) cuz again not I'm not going to go see I won't respond if that's okay okay also
(45:42) the the the prior example of the washing and drying machines that he already tried this
(45:48) with we've seen this in history every time you add tariffs it hurts the
(45:53) consumers yeah again we've already we've already agreed that it'll negligibly raise prices on consumers like you did
(45:59) with washing machines you would what you would have to do is demonstrate that if you had increased all of the taxes by
(46:05) 10% on all companies which make washers and dryers that would be cheaper than the tariff that's what your burden is
(46:12) right now as we kick back and have a smoke and watch you flail and not be able to do it and I enjoy my life over
(46:19) here good idea i'm happy to address this i I know you guys I know you all hate authority figures but just uh I want to cite some economist because I'm not an
(46:25) expert on economy but I do think we can look to experts on this but I have an econ economics degree and I can tell you
(46:31) that what you're reading is propaganda economist let me say three points and I'll go to you first tell us what
(46:39) website you're reading it off of i have multiple here but I'll give you other Which one are you reading off of now though uh the first one is coming from a
(46:46) USA article but they're citing Goldman Sachs warned that Trump's plan for across the board tariffs would could boost uh inflation in 2025 by as much as
(46:54) 1.2% uh one more point tariffs are generally uh passed on to the consumer in the form of higher prices that's
(47:00) coming from AP News and there's a third thing Trump policies are seen as more inflationary overall uh and this coming
(47:07) from uh putting economics on a Forbes article so just uh again I'm not an expert but I think for USA Today
(47:14) economics are saying this at least so you can disagree with them there you can get an economist to say anything you want yeah it's a soft I would qualify as
(47:20) an economist if they I'm not even going to dispute it i'm not even going to dispute what you just said all I need you to do is demonstrate that the
(47:28) corporate taxes are not going to move prices over to the consumer higher than
(47:34) Trump's tariffs that's all I want a demonstration of go ahead
(47:41) like how we would need to demonstrate that in real yeah you would need to demonstrate that yeah there's economic
(47:47) models that can that or just understanding how these things impact the system right a corporate tax affects
(47:53) the uh the the the profit margin of every company so every single product
(47:59) that's sold is affected then with a tariff it's only impacting imports so
(48:05) that's just components of things it's it's spread much thinner throughout the economy but tariffs also raise the the
(48:12) prices of US made goods too sure both both of them do maybe I could use a a
(48:20) demonstration or a scenario to illustrate again this is just hypothetical but let's say a US company was importing electron electronic
(48:26) components from China to manufacture smartphones um theoretically under Trump's policy uh the tariff policies
(48:33) will lead to more uh immediate price increase about 12% and under Harris's corporate tax increases you'd see a
(48:40) smaller potentially more gradual price increase about 1.4 prove it again you're reading propaganda off yeah proven
(48:48) wait but you just said that there's economic charts that can show the that can there are models there are models do
(48:55) you understand do you understand what a domestic model what flow state is referencing he's referencing an economic
(49:00) model so what economists do because they're soft scientists they make predictors but they can't rule out
(49:06) variables that's why it's a soft science right there's so many variables it's very difficult for you to make an economic model which is actually precise
(49:13) and consistent this is why people were wrong when they said that Trump would crash the stock market they thought that
(49:18) his policies would be kind of anti- elitist and anti-stock market but what happened was there was so much faith in
(49:25) Main Street from his tax cuts that people invested overwhelmingly it was a
(49:30) variable they couldn't compensate for so the stock market went through the roof economists get it wrong non-stop and
(49:36) constantly the demonstration here would be on you to say that with a protectionist tariff to equal the
(49:43) playing field with a country that had surpluses with us that somehow keeping
(49:48) free trade with them and allowing them to keep that surplus it would be better to tax the American business instead
(49:55) thus passing those taxes on to the consumer and you're never going to be
(50:00) able to do that ever wait what what stand do you have cuz you're kind of throwing out all the science you make a
(50:06) claim you make We're also making positive claims that you're making positive claim are you not making
(50:12) positive claims about the facts you made the claim i'm waiting for the data you can't push your claim on to me bro i'm a
(50:17) good I'm a real good debater and I'm never going to let you do it i'm never going to let you take your claim and put
(50:22) your burden on me it's your burden if you don't know and you want to move on all you guys have to do is say "We
(50:28) concede we don't know." And we'll move on go ahead
(50:33) are you against corporate taxes yeah okay yeah so I'm I'm not sure why you think it is that we need to provide you
(50:40) with evidence for your I'm asking a question i'm not asking for evidence i'm just asking question we're not here to
(50:46) answer your questions till you back up your claim go ahead you're allowed to ask me a bunch of questions but I'm not
(50:51) allowed to ask you any questions before bro you made a You don't ask me questions about your [ __ ] claim you
(50:57) back up your claim and let me explain something anecdotally i was I was still a commercial loan officer when Trump got
(51:03) in office the first time immediately immediately business exploded people
(51:09) started expanding and you would you can expect that again uh Democrats are always hard worse on the economy than
(51:15) Republicans are i guess I read up my claim this thing got missed i'm saying we can't trust
(51:20) econ like economy experts where you're kind of saying no we can throw out all expertise it's really
(51:26) well we can't trust any of why even talking about any of this
(51:32) you can't outsource thinking you cannot outsource you have to offiscate this is very simple this is very simple i'm not
(51:39) even going to let Flow State do the I know he wants to engage here i get it right but this is this is pure
(51:46) offiscation you made the claim if you can't back up the claim all you have to
(51:52) do is concede this portion of the debate no you just don't like how I'm backing up with ex expert opinions you just
(51:58) don't like that give then then all but your claim your claim specifically was
(52:04) that Trump's tariffs are going to raise the prices to the consumers more than a corporate tax increase go ahead and back
(52:09) that up we'll wait that's what economics are are proposing most economists are saying show me which ones show that
(52:16) that's what history has showed as well show All you got to do is demonstrate it we're waiting hey what about during his
(52:23) first you asking me questions you're just looking for the demonstration of the claim you you can't demonstrate
(52:28) yours either so I guess I didn't make one so I don't need to that's that's how that works i keep I keep I keep making
(52:33) demonstrations of my claim and she be like saying no that doesn't count that doesn't count like I don't I'm not going to keep giving you more claims and you
(52:38) like you keep just swinging them down you want to give me more claims just asking you to back this one up i've already given you multiple
(52:45) show me the source what What am I looking at that backs up this claim go ahead i'm waiting repeat do I need to repeat
(52:51) it again i already repeat it again i know you love to repeat repeat points but uh Dosi feel free to jump off this
(52:57) but I was saying in multiple articles for example Goldman Sachs is warning that Trump's plans across the board tariffs could boost inflation uh by up
(53:04) to 1.2% that's one another one is saying tariffs are generally passed on uh to consumers in the form of higher prices
(53:10) that's coming from an AP news article i can I can put these in the back chat and lastly Trump policies are seen as uh
(53:15) more inflation overall uh setting economics in a Forbes article i can put these all in the back
(53:21) chat that doesn't that makes no demonstration to your claim that the
(53:26) corporate taxes will not raise the consumer prices more than the tariffs
(53:31) that's what I'm looking for it's all predictive and it's all guessing and you can say for [ __ ] sure that that news
(53:38) source is going to compile the the economists that will support the answer that they want to get um if if Trump uh
(53:46) gave up the tariffs then would you support him
(53:51) um so I actually like his uh small business like that uh that 2017
(54:00) uh sorry I don't know the names of them i thought I had them written down somewhere but my notes didn't transfer over to my computer uh actually it might
(54:08) be in here but he had like a small business uh thing that he gave and I I like that and he does want to extend
(54:14) that i would say that's like the only positive thing about any small business tax credit yeah yeah so both of them
(54:22) have that they're exactly the same in that way which supports my Well Harris premise that it's all fake harris wants
(54:28) to help new business owners so she's raising the $5,000 deductible up to $50,000 for
(54:36) first year business owners yeah what deductible so you don't get taxed you
(54:42) you won't get to deductible $50,000 of what you start a new business of what
(54:51) of what thing there's multiple different types of deductibles for businesses so which which thing are we talking about
(54:57) here with a deductible um you don't know i don't know currently
(55:02) it's $5,000 hers raises you guys know anything i thought it was I You don't know anything
(55:10) i don't have a small You know what in the spirit of good faith in the spirit of good faith why don't we go ahead and
(55:15) we'll move on to social policy right how about that i want to say one more thing on ter before we move on if it's okay
(55:21) because I'm not an econom uh not an expert on economics so it is hard for me to like get demonstrate this it's like
(55:26) ask like demonstrate like a really complication but I'll try to do this with a very layman example uh for
(55:33) example here's kind of two examples to show the how the different policies would be implemented so let's say we're talking about like a t a TV is being
(55:39) imported imagine this uh it's a $100 TV uh with a 10% tariff uh the company
(55:45) would probably move it move it up to be $110 to for the tariff the price increase would be immediate and directly
(55:51) passed on to the consumer uh and thus and thus causing a swift rise in inflation versus comparing it to the
(55:57) corporate will happen faster let me finish go ahead bro go ahead versus a
(56:03) corporate policy a corporate uh corporate earning uh a company earning $100 in profit uh they would pay 21 in
(56:10) taxes that if that was 21% rate if if the rate was increased to for example 28
(56:16) they would pay 28 that would be increase in $7 so even already smaller increase
(56:21) already and also they have way more ways to handle that they can absorb the cost they can raise the prices slightly and
(56:27) they can cut expenses elsewhere they're not first of all they're not absorbing [ __ ] and second of all it's not one to
(56:34) one and the third thing that you need to look at there is that uh no there's a
(56:39) good possibility that instead the person who you're in the trade war with [ __ ]
(56:45) loses and then the price of that good drastically decreases which is the point
(56:51) of having the tariff to begin with the distinction is is that under the corporate tax you don't have the ability
(56:58) to [ __ ] the competition with these tariffs you don't have the ability to do so it's a strong point you asked me to
(57:03) give you the the mechanism that's how it's going to be different they're telling you even this one example it's going to be
(57:10) like that example illustrates exactly what I was saying it's propaganda they gave you the most straightforward
(57:16) extreme example where the the product purchased is 100% and only an import
(57:22) yeah it's ridiculous and not only that right I just gave you multiple offsets for this even within the hypothetical
(57:28) the hypothetical doesn't even make sense but again I'm so tired of kicking your guys' asses on this and you're so you're
(57:35) so unwilling to provide actual data that supports your point of consumer
(57:40) increases then I'm happy to move the topic on if you just will concede take the L on this topic we'll move to the
(57:45) next one and I'll give you the L on the next one not going to do it so I Sarah don't
(57:52) get mad at me then because I just tried to move it on i just tried to move it on they want to get their more on this so
(57:57) we're gonna do after this i just wanted to say I found it it was So I was as I was saying it was 50k startup cost
(58:04) deduction so that's what I was trying to say like if you start up a new business the startup cost that's the deductions
(58:10) yeah okay your question so So hang on i just want to make sure I got this right
(58:15) so if you start up a new business with your own money lucky you the
(58:20) government's not going to tax your own money from your startup cost well how nice of them go how nice of them it's
(58:27) 5,000 now and she's raising it to 50,000 okay from the federal level it's it's 5,000 but you have percentage i wonder
(58:34) what that percentage would be if you if on the average startup business because $45,000 is not that much money
(58:41) especially not for a startup cost on Sure but like it's a lot more than half of a truck okay can she affect whatever
(58:49) the state offsets are the answer is no you're talking about a federal offset who cares most of this most of this is
(58:55) not going to matter uh one way or the other it's not going to incentivize people to run out and start nobody's
(59:01) like I was going to start a small business until I realized that I'd have to pay a small percentage on my startup
(59:06) cost or I'd only get 5,000 of it non-deductible nobody's [ __ ] saying that anywhere on planet Earth it doesn't
(59:12) matter it's completely irrelevant it helps it's half It's half of a pickup truck it doesn't do [ __ ]
(59:19) nothing anyway do you guys want to move it to social issues we only have so much time
(59:25) tonight sure we can move on okay so uh I'm I'm guessing that you guys are super
(59:30) excited for women to kill their kids you can't wait it's your favorite yep and as
(59:36) we move into this topic can we please be mindful of the words we use and how we use them thank you
(59:45) thank you well I don't think I did anything to violate to no no no no i'm not saying you did i'm just saying as we
(59:50) move into a deeper topic yeah so uh I'm guessing So when we get when we get to
(59:56) social policies social policies for Trump right i would like for you guys to actually tell me any social policies
(1:00:02) Trump have that you're against go ahead death penalty for drug dealers
(1:00:10) jailing and threatening journalists kind of against that uh he hasn't jailed any journalists
(1:00:16) there's lots of there's lots of domestic polic
(1:00:22) uh what what's not so here's what's going on right there are people who are allowed to slander with misinformation
(1:00:30) and they lie and they use a journalistic publication to do so and Trump wants to change the slander laws and yes if
(1:00:37) you're guilty the president shouldn't do that if you're guilty of slandering a human being and lying about them and
(1:00:43) then using a giant mechanism a corporate newspaper for instance to do so yeah you
(1:00:49) should pay penalties for that i agree with that that's already illegal it's called defamation no that's a civil
(1:00:56) thing it should be criminal that's what Trump is saying you make it criminal yeah i care also I care way more about
(1:01:03) the freedom of press the whole point the whole point of the press to hold people power accountable so like I I'm really
(1:01:09) worried about uh changing that dichconomy because I think the whole point of the press and the freedom press is to make sure people in power are held
(1:01:15) accountable nobody's doing that why would we why would we change the
(1:01:20) laws to create more of a chilling effect on purpose in order to destroy a person's life
(1:01:26) why should I impossible that's impossible proof for instance let's say for instance Ghosty I just want to make
(1:01:32) sure I got this correct you think that it's a moral position to say that if you had a public newspaper which reached
(1:01:38) tens of thousands of people and you had somebody you didn't like so you made up lies on purpose to destroy their life
(1:01:44) and it did that there should be no criminal culpability for you you only a civil liability really
(1:01:51) uh that I'll get behind that you're describing information so that would be against the law freedom of speech yes no
(1:01:58) misinformation is not against the law fine what are you talking about where did you get the idea misinformation is
(1:02:03) against the law i said that'd be defamation what you're describing is a civil that's civil not criminal mhm i
(1:02:11) would be with lowering the standard of defamation for for publications and
(1:02:17) media because I think it is a very high unattainable standard right now so I
(1:02:22) would be fine with lowering that standard so that we can hold some of these what would be wrong with criminal culpability what would be wrong with
(1:02:27) that i don't get it um seems fine seems like if I destroy your entire life with
(1:02:32) lies that I should be I think that's a slippery slope i think I think slippery slope's a fallacy so I'm not going to
(1:02:37) let that terrible record of enforcing things
(1:02:43) accurately one second Flo i'm not going to let you use a facious argument like the slippery slope you never allowed for
(1:02:48) me in for a second so you're saying it's a slippery slope is dismissed what's wrong morally withholding somebody who
(1:02:56) lies on purpose slanders a person destroys their life criminally culpable what is morally wrong with that go ahead
(1:03:04) the assumption that we can accurately use that you're asking me what's what's wrong with perfection and I'm saying
(1:03:10) this is not an option not perfection that is perfection no it's not perfection i'm talking about if you can
(1:03:17) prove by the way in a criminal in a criminal case the evidence is higher is
(1:03:22) higher than it is in a civil case and also the prosecution's judge is if you
(1:03:28) can demonstrate if you can prove that a person on purpose okay slandered you and
(1:03:35) destroyed your life over these slanderous claims I see nothing immoral about holding them culpable for this in
(1:03:42) a legal way can you guys explain how that's an immoral position this is getting pretty close to like making hate
(1:03:48) speech like a law like when you're starting to hurt people when you're starting to be
(1:03:53) like words hurt people to a point of criminality you're getting close to the like hate speech laws no we're not
(1:04:00) getting anywhere near hate speech i would think you of all people would support more freedom of speech not less
(1:04:05) of it what wait first of all why don't you make your your living talking [ __ ]
(1:04:12) to people do you think I have freedom of speech don't make me [ __ ] laugh
(1:04:17) right now we don't have freedom of speech i just got chastised and told that I need to adhere to toos we don't
(1:04:22) have freedom of speech give me a [ __ ] break freedom of speech but we can have less of it we can have less of it don't
(1:04:29) make me [ __ ] laugh it's a joke what a joke we don't No first of all no nobody has no freedom of speech anyway what I'm
(1:04:36) saying is that right now newspaper publications across the United States are allowed to make up massive amounts
(1:04:42) of lies and what they can do is this they buy insurance they buy insurance so that if they're held civily liable
(1:04:47) insurance pays out for them they don't give a [ __ ] they'll make up lies every single day the only way to stop that
(1:04:53) from happening you want a real free republic and fair republic you want to stop that from happening you have to hold people criminally liable for making
(1:05:00) up slanderous lies about you in order to destroy your life and I want to hear a moral argument against that
(1:05:07) so I think kind of a question behind this would be like the the form of reach how much reach do you have and are you
(1:05:14) utilizing that reach in order to like the intention behind it right um and you're going for the moral version of it
(1:05:20) but I think that's where the publicity portion comes in because the intention behind it is to sway um well I'm saying
(1:05:27) that what's happening is to to the person is immoral and to hold them civily liable when insurance can come in
(1:05:34) and just cover their bill so they don't care they actually bake it into their price costs we are going to slander
(1:05:40) people on purpose and lie and it's baked into our price cost model that insurance will just cover whatever we need to pay
(1:05:46) out for the lies and slander we tell even though it destroys people's lives absolutely destroys their lives they do
(1:05:52) it all the time can you give me a moral reason an actual moral reason why those people shouldn't face jail time for
(1:05:58) doing that if they're doing it on purpose no I cannot but morality is not the only consideration when we're talking about these laws because that's
(1:06:04) just the conceptual part implementation is the other part that's why you isolated morality
(1:06:10) yeah i don't care i don't care about the morality i guess that's morally morally because because you know that the implementation is impossible if it's
(1:06:17) morally fine then what is your objection here the implementation unconstitutional might be constitutional
(1:06:24) so what implementation would you agree to
(1:06:29) excuse me what implementation would implementation would you agree to i don't think that we can we can implement these sort of moral paradigms like this
(1:06:36) so I would not I would not support any more freedoms on or restrictions on freedom of speech why not
(1:06:42) because we can't imple implement it well why not because it's subjective
(1:06:48) okay well then we shouldn't have any laws because they're all subjective
(1:06:53) this is uniquely This is uniquely subjective everything is uniquely subjective what What like how what is
(1:07:00) the standard for my life is ruined by words like words hurt me and my life
(1:07:07) yeah it's just it's not words it's not words hurt me it's through through malicious lies right i hurt not only
(1:07:15) your income but your reputation your family i can demonstrate this here's how I can demonstrate this and people will
(1:07:21) be a lot more careful with what they say about other people with such laws on the books that's Donald Trump's entire point
(1:07:27) another person who makes this great point is Elon Musk who says that a bunch of anons can make all sorts of slander
(1:07:34) against people nobody can do anything about it right the thing is is that I don't see anything and neither do any of
(1:07:40) you immoral about holding a person criminally liable who makes up slander and lies through their newspaper
(1:07:46) publication and then says that's okay because even if I'm civilally liable
(1:07:51) it's baked into my cost of doing business that's morally [ __ ] repugnant the the morally repug
(1:07:57) repugnant thing would be the people that you know are going to be chilled into silence on things they should speak on and the people you know are going to be
(1:08:03) punished for things that they should not be punished for yeah for somebody that you can't lie for example the economics
(1:08:08) the economics article that process just cited mhm that would never be written would never
(1:08:15) be written why would that not be written because because it's a subjective prediction and it could impact the the
(1:08:22) election results yeah but if he's wrong how would that be slander well it's causing damage
(1:08:32) within I'm okay with like uh some some examples of news news organizations like
(1:08:37) Fox News being held accountable for like blatant information if they know they're kind of putting that out there like Fox
(1:08:43) News and MSNBC and CN it's definitely
(1:08:48) So now I'm going to give you my take on why it is that liberals actually hate this even though they know that it's not
(1:08:54) immoral nobody can make a moral case against it and they don't even they don't even bother they don't even bother trying to the reason that they don't
(1:09:01) want anti-slander laws is because of this because there's all sorts of issues which are talked about
(1:09:07) right that the person is right about when it comes to things like foreigners coming into the country racial issues
(1:09:13) things like this and they're and what happens is liberals will slander that person with lies to the point where
(1:09:20) their life is destroyed and they're blacklisted from the [ __ ] world and they don't want to go to jail for it
(1:09:25) that's the only reason [ __ ] liberals don't want anti-slander laws i'm protecting Trump right now by being
(1:09:32) against this law that you're proposing i'm literally protecting Trump trump would be in jail a million times over if this Who sent you that talking point
(1:09:38) sweetheart so the liberals that would sler people
(1:09:44) uh so easily when they're in power they're going to slander people still and they're going to have the force of
(1:09:49) the law behind them so they'll actually prosecute people instead of slandering them that's the issue
(1:09:55) i think I agree with Flo with like pragmatically like it's really difficult because you can say it's an opinion piece and like say oh this is my opinion
(1:10:00) like maybe if you had like some emails saying like oh I purposely made this this these false statements in opinion
(1:10:05) article but I think it's going to be really pragmatically difficult to do case by case i think we need to be
(1:10:11) mindful how the obviously me and if if Ghosty and I were having a phone call or
(1:10:17) something and I said something about somebody that would not be considered slanderous right because it's not
(1:10:23) publicized it's not going out to the world so on and so forth so it it's not going to necessarily control your
(1:10:29) freedom of speech i think what Andrew is referring to is like specific publications or people that are putting
(1:10:35) out false information on purpose because slander defamation whatever has to be publicized specific criteria yeah
(1:10:42) there's a whole list of this criteria and the criminal portion of it would require a malicious intent or a harmful
(1:10:49) intent in order to be considered criminal yeah and then he would be crimally liable instead what about
(1:10:56) liable no restriction on what a prosecutor can charge somebody with there is no
(1:11:01) punishment for for excess charging what about a situation where somebody That
(1:11:07) sounds like you just need to give punishments for excess charging fine i'm fine with that too a situation where somebody is actually telling the truth
(1:11:13) and now this person uh doesn't doesn't like that the truth is out there so they charge this person criminally and just
(1:11:20) because they can't prove it to the like to the standard they're that that um
(1:11:25) they are telling the truth about this slander now they're in prison well they're actually protect they actually
(1:11:31) have a higher protection they actually have a higher protection because in criminal court the burden of evidence is much higher than the civil protection
(1:11:38) that they have right now where they could still be sued into [ __ ] oblivion so it actually provides an additional protection for them right but
(1:11:45) if they're actually found liable they go to [ __ ] jail and you know what that would actually solve a whole lot of
(1:11:51) problems with everything the left is claiming is misinformation it's just that then you couldn't publicly slander
(1:11:56) everybody you you call a Nazi and a KKK member and all this other [ __ ] that
(1:12:01) you would like to label people with because you can't make [ __ ] arguments and you don't want to go to jail that's it that's all it I think lowering the
(1:12:08) defamation standards civily would would like hitting people like people don't like losing their money especially big
(1:12:15) media companies I think they don't care if they're protected we move on to something that actually has to do with
(1:12:20) this election well additional clarification too you do require men's rehea in in order to prove a crime so
(1:12:28) the difference between going from the civil version of this to the criminal version is you have to prove like the
(1:12:34) the I had crime on my mind I meant to do this on purpose it was intentional so having that additional criteria criteria
(1:12:42) doesn't necessarily just mean anybody can say they did this on purpose like even if you do something and it's not
(1:12:47) proven to be intentional or malicious the only reason you don't want it is cuz
(1:12:53) you want to call people you don't like [ __ ] Nazis and you'll go to jail that's what you think maybe you just don't
(1:13:01) think sending someone to jail is like a good solution like doesn't really seem to be working these days so like why would sending a journalist to jail is it
(1:13:08) works fine to send people to jail is a deterrent otherwise you would get rid of all laws
(1:13:13) i would get rid of a lot of laws right why don't you get rid of all laws process if going to jail doesn't isn't a
(1:13:19) deterrent why don't we just outlaw everything that's bad him answer a question proess I'm not against laws but
(1:13:27) do you not agree there's like issues with like we're probably sending too many people to jail and doesn't really seem to be doesn't seem to be stopping most people from committing crimes
(1:13:34) usually a better criminal than you than you so then so then pro says why wouldn't you just get rid of laws
(1:13:41) i don't think that's the solution to address that that problem okay so then so then what should happen when a person is found criminally liable for a law
(1:13:48) that they broke what should happen to them depends it depends it's a case by case depends
(1:13:54) on the crime depends on the individual depends on the mental state i don't know that's a really question should they go to jail sometimes yeah yeah so I I don't
(1:14:02) even understand your [ __ ] argument go to sending them to jail doesn't work well what do you want to do when they break the law send him to jail oh genius
(1:14:08) broncess genius brilliant brilliant listen I just don't think that's the best solution i don't know that will fix
(1:14:13) the issue that's the solution broncess if sending people to jail are such a good is a good solution we should send
(1:14:19) people to jail for a whole lot more things we should outlaw every bad decision what are you talking about that doesn't
(1:14:25) even make sense it's the exact It's the exact same thing you did with trying to get rid of all people to jail for moral
(1:14:31) crimes moral crimes theft rape robbery
(1:14:37) words crimes mean words no mean words seems like a little slander would you
(1:14:43) send people to jail for cheating on their spouse no that's immoral not from
(1:14:48) your standard not from the standard of a progressive scumbag it's not immoral i
(1:14:54) think it's immoral about your morals anyway based on what based on what
(1:15:00) based on I think a human yeah based on I think you don't have any standard you have no standard to appeal it to all of
(1:15:07) this is optimism oh what what is your moral stand standard uh based on God
(1:15:13) Christian ethics yeah yeah an unchanging standard based on my human experience we've already been over that we are
(1:15:18) going down a rabbit hole by the way if we do want to get back to uh any more of the social dynamics of the election
(1:15:28) and by the way by the way yeah why not you know what now that I think about it
(1:15:33) yeah if your spouse cheats on you they go to jail for two years what the [ __ ] is wrong with that now that I think
(1:15:41) about it I actually don't see a problem with that what's actually wrong if you get married and you decide a week later
(1:15:47) to go suck some dude's dick and you go to [ __ ] jail what's actually wrong with that this guy wants to vote for Donald Trump ladies and gentlemen this
(1:15:54) this is what I want to Oh no no he's want to go out and suck other men's dicks oh my god what if your wife quits
(1:16:01) having sex with you right after marriage then then should you still go to prison you've you've had a sexless marriage for
(1:16:06) 10 years you go out and get some get a divorce so anyway so back ghosty back to this
(1:16:12) why why actually would it be problematic from your view if a wife went ahead
(1:16:18) because it's immoral right went ahead and cheated on her husband right with some guy if if she had to go to jail for
(1:16:24) two years what's actually wrong with that because I think jail should only be for dangerous criminals that's what I
(1:16:31) believe i I What does that mean i don't even think people should go to jail for like tax fraud and stuff i think jail
(1:16:38) should specifically be for dangerous violent criminals
(1:16:43) i didn't know fault divorce that's [ __ ] wild okay i know Andrew doesn't know the stats but reportedly more men
(1:16:50) cheat than women so like wouldn't men be kind of sure do it across the board by
(1:16:55) the way I don't think that way self-reporting and that's wrong i
(1:17:01) don't think that more men cheat than women i don't believe it i think that women are better at hiding their affairs
(1:17:07) at least that's what they they report or men are worse at investigating yep
(1:17:14) i don't think we should be sending people to jail for I would say petty stuff like that yeah whatever this is nothing at this point we're down we're
(1:17:20) down in the gutter talking about nothing i'd like to get back to Trump and Harris
(1:17:27) okay um so moving on to social issues what's your next social issue that you
(1:17:32) have a problem with Trump on uh his mass deportation plan which is
(1:17:38) ridiculous social issue yeah deport wait wait i'm sorry you don't want him to
(1:17:45) deport illegal immigrants his mass deportation plan is going to be
(1:17:52) like first of all it's just it's not feasible it's not possible we don't have
(1:17:59) Why are you worried about it isn't it possible what are you talking about if it's impossible you don't need to worry
(1:18:04) about it yeah what's What's the problem here because I mean he doesn't have a track record for making big progresses like the wall and not achieving them so
(1:18:10) maybe it's just a track record because Democrats are supposed to get every [ __ ] that wouldn't fund it that could
(1:18:17) happen this time andrew do you generally think he's going to he's going to commit to the the mass deportation that he's going to do it i
(1:18:23) hope so it's not possible to do without like destroying the country pretty much
(1:18:29) our economy big time wait so you're saying that we need to have secondass tier slave labor in this country and
(1:18:34) Trump's going to destroy that and you're upset about it well no we're talking about the logistics of actually achieving his his
(1:18:41) actual policy of mass deportation we think it's not really what Okay so what logistically is impossible about uh
(1:18:47) reinforcing ICE with thousands more agents kicking indoors and grabbing people who are here illegally and
(1:18:53) throwing their ass out of my [ __ ] country what's wrong with that we've we've got to put rounded up all
(1:19:01) It's not hard to round up people and put them in camps countries have done it all throughout the 20th century it It is
(1:19:06) actually it's not we did it during World War II russia did it germany did it it happens constantly
(1:19:12) specific skill set uh that you need what skill set putting people in a cage it's not at all to identify these people and
(1:19:21) and to find where they are have mercy they're not hard to identify there's a whole part with like the families the
(1:19:27) separation of the families we've all been putting them before this court case ghosty every single Japanese who was
(1:19:34) here in World War II was been sent to an internment camp it's nowhere near the amount of people this is This is a super
(1:19:40) simple logistics this is really simple there will be some that fall through the cracks but by and large this is very
(1:19:46) easy to execute yeah why would it just be hard to execute i don't get that it and and like Andrew said it is going to
(1:19:52) affect our economy and I would I wouldn't consider it i wouldn't call it
(1:19:58) slave labor but but that those jobs wage jobs are a huge part of our
(1:20:05) economy so I want I want to make sure I get this right you want people who are here in our country who are sending
(1:20:10) remittances back to their own country okay instead of spending it domestically they're sending millions and millions of
(1:20:16) dollars in remittances back to their home nations okay they're already here illegally they shouldn't even be here in
(1:20:21) the first place you're upset because local corporations can't pay them a lower wage than they pay other people so
(1:20:29) you want them essentially you want a second clear or second tier slave labor force notating for they sneak over here
(1:20:36) to work for it voluntarily it's definitely not slave labor yeah exactly it's a second tier slave yes it is from
(1:20:42) their view it is yes it is no it's not nobody sneaks into slavery hey watch me
(1:20:48) prove you wrong Ghosty do you think that illegal immigrants should get paid the same amount as American citizens
(1:20:54) illegal immigrants yeah probably probably not unless they become legal I guess so okay well why did you why did
(1:21:01) you ask her to prove your point ask me wait we're letting Wait we're letting get critiquing from their world topic of
(1:21:07) whether they're religiously possible and now we're going off into like I mean like morally morally yes but but
(1:21:15) call it slave labor working right now and it's definitely not slave labor
(1:21:22) they deserve to get paid whatever they can negotiate for themselves just like everybody else
(1:21:28) oh that was funny okay so anyway so back to this um yeah I don't actually see any
(1:21:33) uh any big concerns here with rounding up illegals and throwing them out i don't see the problem here if Joe Biden can make massive hotels to accommodate
(1:21:39) them in I don't see why we couldn't make uh some way or buses and things like this to collect them up and throw them
(1:21:45) out no these are people who are applying for asylum 90% of their of 90% of their applications are getting rejected asylum
(1:21:52) meant asylum yeah yeah and 90% have a border with two countries so how are we getting all these asylum seekers that's
(1:22:00) um so a global like immigration happened across Right but that's what I'm saying
(1:22:05) they have to pass through a different country to get here to seek asylum that sort of
(1:22:11) uh neutralizes the threat that they're running from right
(1:22:18) um I I guess I I think there needs to be immigration reform 100% okay let me let
(1:22:25) me Yeah we're pushing we're not We're not like for illegal immigrants i think
(1:22:31) we throw them all the Why can't we throw them all the [ __ ] out why not because it's a disa a disastrous plan again for
(1:22:38) why why is it disastrous what the fact it's going to cost a [ __ ] ton of money like 21% of construction oh no it's
(1:22:45) going to cost a bunch of money to enforce our laws and throw out illegal immigrants who also killed you say you say you care about like pom but yet like
(1:22:51) you don't care when Trump wants a higher deficit than all his nasty i don't really care about him calm
(1:22:58) down calm down i'll explain oh no you You've been talking let me just jump one more second you You talk about all the
(1:23:04) time but it's really clear like you don't mind when Trump spends all the money he wants like it's okay when he does it but if any Democrats spend money
(1:23:10) it's the worst thing ever but they're both going to borrow it sir you look even now and in the past higher deficits
(1:23:16) even when we had a better economy so they're both going to borrow it you can't tell me for a second Kla Harris is going to lower the national deficit
(1:23:22) she's going to borrow a shitload of money they're both going to borrow it we both know that they're both Trump borrowed way more what are you talking
(1:23:27) about did he borrow hundred million more dollars than the the next guy who's
(1:23:33) going to borrow 100 million who gets more than any president ever you say you care about the economy you don't care
(1:23:38) why even talking about you don't care about economist opinions you don't care about the debt why are we even talking
(1:23:44) about the [ __ ] why you don't care yeah
(1:23:49) I'm going to discuss it it's going to be worse but here's the thing the truth is is
(1:23:54) that both of them are going to borrow a shitload of money there's not a damn thing that anybody can do about that because the United States has a
(1:24:00) borrowing problem there's nothing we can do we have so many unfunded liabilities or less we have so many unfunded
(1:24:07) liabilities that we're always going to have to borrow there's nothing we can do about that what you're talking about
(1:24:12) though is you're talking about an entire sea of people who bankrupted the California medical system bankrupted
(1:24:18) them because they have no insurance no nothing and they used ER care as general care they bankrupted the entire
(1:24:25) California medical system some of the best surgeons in the world some of the best care units in the world [ __ ]
(1:24:30) bankrupted from illegal immigration that cost passed on the to the consumer as well this happens with illegals all over
(1:24:37) the country had one of the best open heart surgeons or surgery wards in
(1:24:42) California gone this happens non-stop they bankrupt the medical industry and
(1:24:47) you people are like "Oh no that's fine because it's going to cost a little bit of money to deport them." [ __ ] you they
(1:24:53) need to get out of my country ASAP and if we have to fund some [ __ ] buses to
(1:24:59) do it then overarchingly that's going to lower the cost across the board over time as long as you keep them out it's
(1:25:05) not buses it's planes it's detention centers it's jails it's agents why we
(1:25:10) want immigrants they're a scapegoat they're a scapegoat and neither side wants to deport them that's why you had
(1:25:16) Republicans making excuses to [ __ ] them all over the rest of the country as well right why aren't we passing actual
(1:25:23) immigration legislation that will prevent more people from coming in we could actually build a wall make it
(1:25:29) reasonable for people to come in here oh now you want to build a wall fix now you want to build a wall i I would build the
(1:25:36) bridge if we if we made if we if we propose some kind of reasonable
(1:25:43) immigration policy for people to immigrate here where it doesn't take like a million years it doesn't cost
(1:25:48) like a million dollars people can stay with their families and everything like this fix the whole asylum processes um
(1:25:55) add more judges how about this instead here's a counter proposal the United
(1:26:00) States National Guard and the border states right often has nothing all day long to do so just like in Rome when we
(1:26:06) deployed our soldiers or when they deployed their soldiers to build roads why not deploy the National Guard to go
(1:26:12) ahead and set up a massive a massive wall and then have them go ahead and
(1:26:17) patrol that wall and when illegals try to come up through the border right they arrest them on the [ __ ] spot and then
(1:26:23) they hold them in a detention center and then charge the country that they come from of origin in this case Mexico a fee
(1:26:30) for every single one which is captured at the border thus incentivizing them to keep them behind their own damn border
(1:26:37) how about we do that i don't know how we how would Mexico
(1:26:43) feel about that i know I had to consult what Mexico thinks about it why do we give a [ __ ] they're a partner they like
(1:26:49) affect our economy so like we might have to do about it bro what are they gonna do about it kind It's kind of like when
(1:26:55) It's kind of Wait it's kind of like when Trump says "Oh we're going to have the Mexicans pay for the wall." You think that involves some communication with Mexico do you think he's just like going
(1:27:01) to be like "Oh yeah they're going to decide to do that there has to be some coordination countries like that they
(1:27:07) can't do anything about it bro there's nothing they can do we don't want to stop immigration legal immigration is
(1:27:12) fine nobody said anything about it i'm talking about illegals who are coming up through the border why not have the National Guard there on a [ __ ] wall
(1:27:18) and every single time you charge me a reasonable like a bipartisan bill that Trump shot down how
(1:27:25) about that oh you know he shot it down because of ear marks and pork spinning in the bill that's why it got shot down
(1:27:31) so the thing is is like look and and moving back into this this is super important you resisted the wall every
(1:27:37) which way you could ghosty says "No I I'm not opposed to having a wall let's build a wall over there." Yes of course
(1:27:43) we need to keep illegals out there's no reason for us not to use our national guard for our own national defense in
(1:27:48) this case this is a national defense issue because it's not just Mexicans coming up i was on the whatever podcast
(1:27:53) and talked to a Russian a Russian infiltrator who came up through the southern border russian she said I came
(1:28:02) up through through the border right and I went through the asylum process right the whole nine yards and she was an only
(1:28:08) fans prostitute boy we're really bringing in the best and the brightest aren't we from that border who are trying to get political asylum it's
(1:28:15) [ __ ] ridiculous what needs to happen instead is we need to treat our border just like every other country treats
(1:28:21) their border as a military zone and you do not cross our military zone it's our
(1:28:27) [ __ ] country not Mexico's country how hot was the Russian though that's
(1:28:32) the question i know you're disagree Andrew but like I think the bipartisan bill would have been a step in the right direction you can always oppose more
(1:28:39) legislation when Trump wins presidency if that happens like you want but like that would have been a step in the right direction i know probably didn't have
(1:28:45) like everything you possibly want but it would have been a lot harder it would have made harder than it is today so I
(1:28:50) don't know why we would just shoot that down would be harder biden let in 5 million illegal immigrants all and then
(1:28:56) and then if Wait wait wait wait yeah but if that happened it would be shut down they shut down the entire board for two
(1:29:02) weeks yeah oh wow oh that's not going to a huge impact on people coming through
(1:29:07) the door no do you know how many weeks there are in a in a term yeah two out of 50 two out of 50 you're talking about
(1:29:14) and this guy already let in 5 million two out of 200 here's what here's what you're saying here's what you're saying
(1:29:20) this is also this doesn't matter what you should do you put that you put that in the law and then when you when you presence you put you change it or make a
(1:29:27) a better law yeah and you don't just knock it down and then be like you give
(1:29:32) them progress that was part of the law was amnesty correct wasn't Wasn't
(1:29:37) Amnesty the law go ahead go see amnesty was also part of
(1:29:43) the law but here's the thing let's dive into this here's what you want to do so Biden lets in 5 million 5 million
(1:29:50) illegals before he starts enforcing the border because he goes "Oh [ __ ] this is unattainable we can't be spending millions of dollars here putting these
(1:29:56) people up in hotel rooms." Right even though we want to make the future Democrat voter of America we just can't
(1:30:01) afford to do this we're getting a lot of political pressure after he already let in 5 million so here's what happened the
(1:30:06) donkey took a giant [ __ ] on America's face and you're going "Well here's a paper towel so you can clean it up."
(1:30:12) [ __ ] that bro [ __ ] that that's the
(1:30:18) stupidest ever [ __ ] heard i agree 10 out of 10 on that analogy i agree i
(1:30:23) think a better Biden could have done better with the border 100% but he's not
(1:30:29) running again harris is and if she wants to get re-elected who was the borders are it was not Kla Harris i'm sorry can
(1:30:37) you look Can you look up Kla Harris borders are i'll wait oh what was what was that like law you were talking about
(1:30:43) with misinformation and sending people to jail and [ __ ] like that what was her she official title was
(1:30:50) no it was an official title here you want me I'll I'll read it for you if you'd like well speaking of Harris cuz she was a prosecutor why wouldn't you
(1:30:57) expect like crime to be actually like better or get better under under her under her time versus actual convicted
(1:31:03) criminal way to enable way more crime under their under their presidency they're worse than cops
(1:31:11) yeah kla Harla Harris failure to secure the United States border 5 million come in she was officially she was officially
(1:31:18) put in as border official title that's not propaganda is that her actual title it's okay if he
(1:31:25) reads the article but I do no it's not cool no he's he's telling you what the official title is he's not 118th
(1:31:31) Congress that's from the 118th Congress yes official title this is not speculation now you believe them the
(1:31:39) Congress this has already happened it's not a projection i believe the Congress yeah
(1:31:45) what do you mean this is a projective we're not going to wait and see how this pans out this is
(1:31:50) already Biden said it yeah biden said it himself he has said himself that that was the borders are yes Kla Harris it
(1:31:56) was part of her failure 5 million came in again the donkey came over took a giant [ __ ] on our face you're trying to
(1:32:02) hand me a paper towel and say "Well that's fine we'll clean it up [ __ ] that [ __ ] off that's [ __ ] i want these
(1:32:08) guys out of my [ __ ] nation tomorrow you have failed us you Democrats failed us you can do that after the fact you
(1:32:14) don't have to knock down a law that's going to make it better than it's today just cuz you want something better in the future." You just need to fuckingly
(1:32:19) do your [ __ ] job how about we just get rid of Harish and we have not just it's not just the five million they're
(1:32:25) going to add more courts like not just it's a lot of investment beyond the
(1:32:31) criminal you want to catch people come coming across illegally or the people doing false amnesty I thought you cared
(1:32:36) about that you just mentioned that a second ago you care about that you probably want to court processes yeah let's let's see process let me ask you a
(1:32:42) question okay let's say that you hired a person to come in and build your house and he [ __ ] it up he [ __ ] your whole
(1:32:47) house up would you go ahead and say well that's fool because uh now we'll rehire
(1:32:52) you and you're promising that well this time I'm not going to [ __ ] your house up would you would you go ahead and hire
(1:32:58) that same contractor process you already [ __ ] up the bathroom might as well have the kitchen might as well [ __ ] up everything right would you rehire that
(1:33:04) contractor if he [ __ ] your house up process i got to compare the numbers cuz if you look at someone like Obama
(1:33:13) dude you're [ __ ] That's a god where do you people come from where do you people come from dude here's how the
(1:33:19) numbers play out it's going to be more expensive as we [ __ ] up your kitchen too bro can we just take a moment to absorb
(1:33:25) that he said I have to look at the numbers can we just take a moment and have a drink
(1:33:31) here i go based on fact unlike some people you know based on feelings you know I like actually look the numbers
(1:33:37) and actually get my opinions based on numbers yeah harris as a vice president really doesn't have much say i know this
(1:33:43) whole like borders are talking point um but she really doesn't have that much control the Republicans denied two the
(1:33:51) second most powerful position huh i I got to jump in here it's the
(1:33:56) second most powerful position in the whole government one sec i found the numbers yeah like Biden's administration
(1:34:01) is just behind Trump as faration there's not like a huge difference in like the deportation are doing i think you're
(1:34:07) saying there's a lot more to deport cuz he left 5 million in yeah I'm sure he Oh they're finally catching up they're
(1:34:13) finally doing their job trump's not doing a better job though so why would you think Trump's going to do better you just said that a second ago so now what
(1:34:19) you're saying is you're saying failure i'm saying the numbers the same so we don't It's not a concern of ours the
(1:34:25) same on on on that unless we he actually does the deportation he's promising but I don't I don't see it what you're saying to me now is this do you want to
(1:34:32) make me What you're saying to me now is this you're saying "Okay the donkey has
(1:34:37) [ __ ] on your face here's a paper towel." so that you could wipe it off but but I
(1:34:43) promise you that Biden analogy but it fails that Biden who sent the donkey to
(1:34:48) [ __ ] on your face is going to wipe it off quicker than Trump are you [ __ ] serious bro you mean Harris this is a
(1:34:55) serious argument harris oh yeah harris sorry Harris
(1:35:01) um is is such a big issue right now that's something she's really going to want to focus on especially if she wins
(1:35:07) and she wants to get reelected she's going to have to prove that she's not letting as many people in through the border and actually taking Did she go to
(1:35:14) the border at all not even once well no i'm sorry she did yeah she didn't do She
(1:35:19) didn't do a photo opportunity how horrible her job is do being the vice
(1:35:25) president unlike someone else bro I misspoke she did and she did do a photo op but the thing is is like Kla's been
(1:35:31) hiding this entire election she barely does any interviews she does everything that she can to shut herself away from
(1:35:36) the public because she has no [ __ ] plans to do anything she has she's a DEI candidate and by the way
(1:35:44) if you guys love democracy so much can you just tell me real quick why it is that you're instructing people to go
(1:35:49) ahead and vote for a woman who was never democratically put in there by your own party yeah because she was vice
(1:35:56) president and she was going to be vice president under Biden so therefore when you're voting for Biden you are also
(1:36:03) inherently voting for Kamla too especially since Biden is such an old man that it's very likely that he could
(1:36:08) have passed away or something could have happened where she likely could have become president so by voting for Biden
(1:36:14) you're also voting for Kamla okay real quick before I rip this apart
(1:36:21) right ah real
(1:36:26) quick we're waiting before I rip this apart let me just explain a couple of
(1:36:33) concepts to it yes when Biden's president the vice
(1:36:38) president if he's in firm gets to be president that has this is pre-election
(1:36:44) pre- anybody voting it does not def stop it does not default to the vice
(1:36:51) president because the president bows out that is [ __ ] insane i mean the Democrats could have put up anybody they
(1:36:58) wanted to anybody they could have taken the second on the ticket and nobody could have said a [ __ ] word about it
(1:37:03) that's their candidate what you just said total [ __ ] [ __ ] lies total [ __ ] lies it's not a lie at all it's
(1:37:10) actually It is a lie yeah it doesn't default to Kamla in an election that's [ __ ] [ __ ] lies i never said it
(1:37:16) defaulted to I'm saying it's not I'm saying by voting for Biden you're technically voting for Kamla too so she
(1:37:22) was saying she got the vice president it's not really that it's not really this big like whole like oh my god
(1:37:27) democracy is being open then how come how come you how come you didn't take the next candidate who got the second
(1:37:34) amount of votes why not do that wouldn't her laugh be enough reason not to vote for her do you want to hear that cackle
(1:37:40) for four more years that's pretty terrible to be honest but I still want my answer to my question why if you love democracy
(1:37:46) minutes about nothing and tariffs yeah yeah but why if you love democracy didn't you just go ahead with the candidate that had the second most votes
(1:37:53) for the primary why not how come because I think
(1:37:59) uh based on like the actual like the laws there is a legitimate process to have uh the vice president who is again
(1:38:04) in the first in the line of succession uh take over when they're on when on the
(1:38:10) same ticket yes there is a process for that you can you can like the process but that's established bro they could
(1:38:15) have had anybody they wanted that's the process yeah the DNC and the RNC are both like
(1:38:21) kind of corrupt yeah so why didn't why didn't they go with a second amount of votes that's the actual process they had
(1:38:28) anybody they wanted because they thought Camala would have won anyway most Democrats wanted wanted to take
(1:38:34) over they don't care about democracy they all care about winning is [ __ ] winning they didn't You didn't go with
(1:38:40) the will of the people the will of the people the will of people was the will of people was Camala
(1:38:47) because they voted for the Biden Harris ticket in the primary yeah by the way if I go back through your guys' streams
(1:38:53) after this debate are I just want to see if you guys will lie to me because we I'll actually do this if I go back
(1:38:58) through your streams post debate are you going to talk about how Joe Biden's actually a very soundminded candidate
(1:39:04) just weeks before he was removed tell me the truth tell me the truth i've only been streaming for three months so I
(1:39:09) wasn't streaming back then am I going to hear you say that Biden is a sound-minded candidate just a couple of
(1:39:14) weeks before he was removed am I going to hear that Ghosty i probably wasn't talking about politics either to be
(1:39:20) honest so I'm not gonna I just want to hear that I'm not gonna hear it right i'll tell you i made I made arguments
(1:39:26) that even if he was completely Yeah is there I made arguments that even if he was completely brain dead he'd be a
(1:39:31) better a better leader than Trump because he is he can establish a cabinet that
(1:39:38) actually will like get stuff done and not he won't fire everyone have you ever tried lithium to trying lithium no no i
(1:39:44) love this argument i love this argument so wait a second so unelected officials would be running the country with a
(1:39:50) puppet president and you think that that's optimal i don't think it's optimal i said I would still vote for I
(1:39:55) still like I'd like that over Trump be still be more successful let you know that you've just endorsed what we like to call the deep state dummy i just said
(1:40:02) I don't think it's as good i'm saying I think they still have better results you turn it over to the deep state over an actually democratically elected
(1:40:09) competent president got it so what is the devil that you know what about Trump
(1:40:15) would make you prefer the devil that you don't know wait what what is the worst thing about
(1:40:21) Trump besides his tariffs i just think he doesn't really care
(1:40:26) about the middle class i think he's kind of laring i think he really just wants to help out people like himself the the rich and more elite class and I think
(1:40:34) this is just a vibe opinion so no no the policies are like that yeah it's his tariffs he wants to get rid of the chips
(1:40:41) act is taxing the uh middle class more
(1:40:47) middle class more how he's raising taxes on the middle class oh
(1:40:54) by raising taxes on the middle class how permanent tax cuts yeah that's not that's the opposite of raising taxes on
(1:41:00) the middle class classes no no no no no wait i'm sorry i'm sorry if you admit
(1:41:06) that a corporate tax increase is going to raise the prices on goods then what he has done is he's expanding the
(1:41:12) economy allowing corporations to hire people at better wages that's what he's doing that's a tax cut for the middle
(1:41:18) class doofus by So if people pay more taxes at the
(1:41:24) end of the year that's a tax cut no no no no no that's not what I said
(1:41:30) he's having people decreased the if he how would they be paying more taxes how
(1:41:36) by making them pay more taxes how are they How's he making them pay more taxes by raising their taxes whose taxes Whose
(1:41:44) taxes are Trump's raising who uh lower and middle inome people there's Okay what's the policy show me show me the
(1:41:51) policy show me the policy yeah show me the policy i want to look it up so the
(1:41:57) 2017 tax cuts and jobs act that Trump signatured into tax legislation uh look
(1:42:02) at the stats affected more highincome households than uh Yeah that's great she just said that Trump is raising taxes on
(1:42:09) the middle class can you show me what Trump's proposal is that is raising taxes on the middle class i will find it
(1:42:16) okay you find it you're never going to find it but go ahead i'm going to wait patiently and so will flow state don't worry
(1:42:23) i will say this uh I'll look it up in a second but I do know unlike unlike Trump Camala actually has some policies that
(1:42:30) would give tax cuts to the middle class in particular like actually addressing them and targeting them where I don't see Trump doing it at all like what so
(1:42:36) she's increasing deductions he's cutting taxes and increasing deductions yeah
(1:42:42) tell me tell me how how is Kamla going to be cutting taxes on the middle class
(1:42:49) i think it's multiple ones but I think a lot of go see Dave response it you literally don't pay as much taxes at the
(1:42:56) end of the year okay yeah can you can you can you explain Can you explain how she's cutting taxes on the middle class
(1:43:04) if you make a certain amount of money how much and less you pay less taxes
(1:43:09) yeah how much i don't know the exact number it's $400,000 i think she said under
(1:43:17) $400,000 she said nobody's taxes would be raised under that okay but that's not a tax cut on the middle class what are
(1:43:24) you talking about saying that by not raising taxes on the
(1:43:29) middle class that's a tax cut what are you talking about you're paying less taxes how are you paying less taxes what
(1:43:35) are you talking about her plan says that these people like especially which again like I don't agree with i wish she would
(1:43:42) like talk more about like the middle class but like for very lower income people they're going to pay like
(1:43:48) extremely less amount of tax ing the taxes now they don't pay any now
(1:43:55) they get more in the returns than they pay into the system now so if you have a if you have like an earned income child
(1:44:01) credit of $4,000 and you have four kids you probably get more of a return from the system than you ever paid in what
(1:44:09) are you talking about that's not true it is true that's not true just from
(1:44:14) totally i know that's not true oh my god okay just listen i will stop this whole debate so you can look this up okay all
(1:44:23) I want you to do is look up one thing do poor people get more back from the
(1:44:29) system of taxes than they pay into the system of taxes i will wait when my mom
(1:44:35) was making under $11,000 a year she was paying taxes at the end of the year she
(1:44:41) was not getting money back let me let me make sure I got this correct i just want to make sure I got this right how many
(1:44:46) children did your mom have one okay let's say she had three what would her
(1:44:51) earned income child credit be at the end of the year it would be more than her wages
(1:44:59) okay well it wasn't okay what if she didn't have This is like I I don't even know what if her
(1:45:05) children were over 18 okay so can you engage with what I'm saying can you engage with what I'm saying if some
(1:45:11) people If a woman has three children okay wait wait this is not really about
(1:45:17) We're talking about middle class you're talking like a single mom with three kids the middle class they would have they would be paying up they would have
(1:45:23) they would have No we're talking about middle class that's what we're talking That's what came up a second ago and they would be paying
(1:45:28) tax i think we're trying to go into a hypothetical let's We're going to let your never going to let the offiscation
(1:45:35) happen the current the current child's uh tax thing whatever is like 2,000 so
(1:45:41) if she had three No it's 4,000 it's $4,000 it's $2,200 yeah it's
(1:45:50) 4,000 or I think it's at least three but I'm pretty sure the earn the earned income tax credit or something else the
(1:45:56) the child tax credit i think it's four i'm saying that went up under Trump by the
(1:46:03) way so the thing is is like But even if it's 2,000 if it's 2,000 you make $11,000 a year okay at the end of
(1:46:11) the year you would be receiving $6 thou
(1:46:18) $6,000 how could you possibly pay more in taxes on $11,000 than the $6,000 you get back
(1:46:25) from the government lady how so for clarification it comes in uh at it was
(1:46:32) at 2,000 it now went up to 3600 per child for children age five and younger
(1:46:39) 4k like I said and then anybody else over that is is 3,000 so just real quick just help me out here $11,000 you have
(1:46:45) three kids you get a $6,000 tax return how did you pay more in taxes than you
(1:46:52) got back can you explain that to me my mom had one child and I wasn't under five okay even with one ch even with one
(1:46:58) child even with one child if you made $11,000 you got $2,000 return from the
(1:47:04) IRS how did you pay taxes she also might have just been bad at doing her taxes how did you pay taxes if you got a
(1:47:10) $2,000 return on $11,000 in wages how i I don't know you don't know she has
(1:47:18) She has my aunt do this is not tax she's like a tax i'm going to do the destiny we're
(1:47:25) missing the point we're missing the point the point is to address the middle class this is not He hates it this is
(1:47:32) not a good criticism of the of the of the tax credit because the point of tax credit is to address the middle class so it would be people that no taxes where
(1:47:39) this would be relevant we're not talking about people that make the same $1,000 a
(1:47:45) year has the same tax credit so let's I mean running the hypothetical on middle
(1:47:50) class uh even if we ran that and you still had three children you still would
(1:47:55) be getting back a good portion then presuming if you're middle class you wouldn't be paying any income tax at all
(1:48:01) you wouldn't be paying a single [ __ ] dime you'd be getting money back that you never paid in so if you're if you
(1:48:06) made $11,000 in a year you had two kids you got 4,000 back there's no possible way you'd ever be paying into the system for
(1:48:14) your wages the amount of tax you got back not even close i doubt even on consumption since food has no taxes on
(1:48:20) it that you would even do that because what can you afford to pay with $11,000 you would be a net drain to the system
(1:48:26) Ghosty poor people do not pay taxes they don't pay them they never have paid them
(1:48:32) because there's nothing to pay you can't get blood out of a turnup in instead they get all sorts of tax incentives
(1:48:38) back to them they actually are a net fiscal drain on the system and then you have welfare and everything else on top
(1:48:43) of it like what are you talking about yeah she didn't and that's the paradigm that the the government has the people
(1:48:50) in right is they leverage that they give [ __ ] they give part of the booty to the poor half of the population so that they
(1:48:57) vote for them again yeah that's part of this that's part of the scam i agree so that was my problem with with like what
(1:49:02) I was trying to explain with Kamla is I wish he would give more money to like the middle class instead of these extreme like impoverished groups no what
(1:49:10) you said was that Trump had policies that was going to raise the taxes on the middle class and the poor i explained
(1:49:15) that the poor don't even pay taxes for the most part and they don't and I just proved it to you now can you show me the
(1:49:20) policy that Trump has taxes back then yeah can you show me the the policy that Trump has that's actually going to raise
(1:49:27) taxes on the middle class a direct assess tax go ahead i'm looking at both of them right now
(1:49:33) and they both have the same tax credit provisions yeah well I mean for the earn for the child credit that's true right
(1:49:39) child credit and earned income um both of them are going to increase that so how is he going to how's he how's he going to [ __ ] increase tax on the
(1:49:45) middle class can you explain that what's his policy to do that i think I don't know this har I don't know this was
(1:49:51) referring to but Harris has multiple plans the child tax credit is one thing but also question about Harris it's
(1:49:56) about Trump what policy is Trump going to do that's going to raise tax on the middle
(1:50:03) class what what what's the policy what is it
(1:50:08) i don't know the name of it it was the chart I saw on his for his plan that
(1:50:13) showed who was going to be taxed the most and who was going who was going to receive more taxes and who was going to
(1:50:20) get tax cuts do you know that income tax was originally supposed to be a temporary
(1:50:26) thing only on the rich for World War II fun fact I think I did hear that
(1:50:35) somewhere um do you have do you still have this chart that you're referring to
(1:50:42) um but I do I think I feel like I think I know what's happening or the I think what Goi is saying is when you compare
(1:50:47) the tax cuts versus like she's saying in totality the middle class will end up paying less taxes under Harris she's not
(1:50:54) I think she's saying directly Trump uh maybe there was some this but I think she's kind of not saying directly like
(1:50:59) Trump is going to have taxes that will affect the middle class in particular but more so in the aggregate they'll
(1:51:04) have more of an effect under Trump is that kind so I'm just going to make a shout out to my wife real quick to uh
(1:51:10) bring me down a shot in another drink so that I can get through whatever is left in this this debate this is uh this is
(1:51:17) the most insane [ __ ] that I've heard all year and that's saying something that is
(1:51:23) saying something that is saying something it was on the Wall Street Journal but I saw like other people back
(1:51:29) it up like um other tax people
(1:51:35) um I don't know so Trump's plan people who do taxes for people CPAs accountants
(1:51:42) um Trump's plan says it will double the deductions and Camala's raises it from four to
(1:51:48) six so that's a third okay can we move to I guess we'll move to a different policy so uh here's a policy that I'm
(1:51:55) really invigorated about and support in a massive way uh Trump has proposed to
(1:52:01) cut all tax from all overtime pay any objections there yeah that's stupid oh
(1:52:07) it's stupid tax on but we shouldn't be not taxing tips and we shouldn't be not
(1:52:13) You mean like Kla Harris kla Harris the lower and middle class earns i know she wants to do that too the tax on tips I'm
(1:52:20) like you know that's lower class people getting that money yeah I know so we
(1:52:27) should be taxing more you want you want to tax when we make all these tax cuts uhhuh where where is this money coming
(1:52:35) from what do you mean where's the money coming from there's no money coming from anywhere
(1:52:42) you're letting people keep their money you're letting people keep their money yeah it would be a stop money coming
(1:52:47) from so t So Trump wants to balance all these tax cuts with his massive tariffs
(1:52:54) that's his plan do you want taxes do you want more or less taxes do you want more or less taxes no no no you have his plan
(1:53:01) the plan is the opposite you just said that because of all the tariffs that are coming in there's going to be a massive
(1:53:06) amount of tax revenue because we are taxing the imports and exports what are
(1:53:12) you talking about what are you talking about that makes no sense you just got done say "Well he's going to balance
(1:53:18) he's going to balance the fact that he's still collecting massive amounts of revenue from tariffs which is his plan
(1:53:24) and then he's going to let people keep their overtime pay what a [ __ ] monster." And let's be real nobody
(1:53:29) claims their tips anyways yeah that's why that So it's not they're
(1:53:34) not really conceding anything there they weren't they already weren't getting the overtime thing is kind of difficult because people might be like I don't
(1:53:41) know starting to uh work slower or like I don't know i
(1:53:47) just overtime pay time and a half so they would already be doing that there's already plenty of incentive for that i
(1:53:53) just think these massive tax cuts people are trying they're working slower bro
(1:53:58) flow state i am a little conflicted with these [ __ ] flow states it's really
(1:54:03) not that complicated they both have tax cuts but the the one Trump's proposing are probably going to affect the rich more and not as much the middle class
(1:54:09) the one Paris are proposing more the middle class less so the rich the rich don't earn overtime they're on salary or
(1:54:17) they have ownership for clarification purposes uh Ghosty I'm
(1:54:24) a little conflicted with with your statement only because it is contradicting to what you were saying to
(1:54:29) a degree um because you were saying how you didn't like the fact that the middle class were being taxed um or you know to
(1:54:36) the higher degree but then also Flow State is right the people that do earn
(1:54:42) the bulk of overtime or or uh tips would be the the middle to lower class uh who
(1:54:48) are working the overtime so that would be very conflicting in very contradictive in terms of the argument
(1:54:54) alone it sounds really nice in theory like of course nobody wants to pay taxes right but taxes are actually like
(1:54:59) important for our for our society for our government to run we need so we can drop more bombs round up more immigrants
(1:55:09) also I don't know about I don't know about other I know also Harris has proposed eliminating the federal income
(1:55:14) tax for tips for workers i don't know what um other aspects Trump has done the same thing yeah they both have that they
(1:55:20) both have that as a provision but it's a nothing burger because like I said nobody reports their tips except for the bare ass minimum they have to anyways i
(1:55:27) will give the caveat it's probably happening a little bit more as uh like credit card and POS systems have like become more adopted but definitely cash
(1:55:33) are definitely not being accounted for yeah and yeah taxes taxes fund the debt
(1:55:45) okay so I think we keep going like if you guys want money to deport people
(1:55:52) where that from i don't um I'm I don't want that i'm just trying to figure out if you want more or less taxes for the
(1:56:00) average American i want a balance of uh goods goods at a
(1:56:07) at a nice price at an affordable price and then also a balance of not getting
(1:56:13) taxed out the ass and I think both candidates to be honest are a little bit extreme with both I don't nec This is an
(1:56:20) exchange though the more of one you have the less of the other you have so how which where are you sliding it
(1:56:26) because I would prefer that the individual just be taxed less and the government can deal with its own [ __ ] inflated spending and and budget issues
(1:56:34) again it comes down to the consumer the consumer pays the price of the goods and services and all these costs of things
(1:56:43) so we could so inflation inflation will go if consumers if workers are not
(1:56:48) getting charged for taxes for overtime that does not increase prices that would actually decrease
(1:56:54) prices because of the the product that that's being made with that overtime
(1:57:01) hour yeah the business would be able to hire more overtime workers so they'd be more productive with the same amount of
(1:57:07) business dollars spent okay um I don't know maybe maybe the
(1:57:14) overtime thing is okay like this isn't something I'm like super crazy on i just think uh if we do too many tax cuts
(1:57:22) that's probably not good overall just like these these the we would have to
(1:57:29) stop sending so much money so much foreign aid out we don't most of the foreign aid we send
(1:57:35) out is in like old military machines weapons and [ __ ] it's not actual money
(1:57:41) we send it we send a ton of cash out we send I think none of these things are inherently wrong like tax cuts or taxes
(1:57:47) it's more so how they're applied and how they'll be effective i actually think the tax cuts are morally wrong talk
(1:57:52) about the taxes are morally wrong it's coercive infrastructure police like
(1:57:58) again like the the asylum people and whatever like all this comes from taxes
(1:58:03) our military and if I could stop paying for for a lot of these things I absolutely would i would love to stop buying some of these services that I'm
(1:58:10) forced to have i'm curious Andrew how do you feel about Kamala's at
(1:58:15) least proposed plan to invest into the police force giving some more money there [ __ ] that [ __ ]
(1:58:22) her proposed plan was I think that was flow state but uh I don't know specific
(1:58:28) I can do some live research but I think at least she's proposing to make some investments into like the police force uh Camala I think both of them are
(1:58:36) because the police union is a big special interest group so both of them will be supporting
(1:58:42) it oh no hey hey hang on hang on hang on sure go ahead yeah absolutely i'm I'm
(1:58:49) sure that Kla Harris will invest in the police force to give them a bunch of DEI
(1:58:54) training and lower the standards so more women come in and make absolutely sure that the weakest people do one of the
(1:59:01) toughest jobs around i'm absolutely sure that she'll do that now I'm also pretty positive that Trump who is a real law
(1:59:07) and order guy will likely also invest in police departments across the nation but
(1:59:12) perhaps will not do DEI standards and lower the standards so that the very weakest of the sexes can somehow get
(1:59:19) through the really basic training segments so that they can actually apply the law to criminal cases but you know
(1:59:25) what do I know i'm going to trust the prosecutor over the committed criminal to implement that but that's just me oh I trust criminals way more than
(1:59:32) prosecutors prosecutors are flying you're going to trust what what does this have to do with her prosecutotorial
(1:59:37) role i want you to show me a standard of Kla Harris uh ever saying that she's
(1:59:42) going to raise law enforcement standards so that what happens is you have to be
(1:59:48) able to meet the rigorous physical demands of the job or is she going to
(1:59:53) lower standards i'd love to see that i'm sorry that's your claim right so wouldn't you I didn't make a claim he
(2:00:00) made the claim you made a claim that she was I know she's gonna invest into it initiate said
(2:00:05) one to hire weaker police officers that claim so let's let's see well let's see
(2:00:12) under Democrats would you guys say that the standards have been lowered for uh
(2:00:18) DEI hires and police forces or do you think they've been raised go ahead and let me let me know real quick and I'll
(2:00:24) go ahead and pull this up and we'll go over it together do you think it's been raised under Democrats the standards or lowered for
(2:00:31) DEI hires go ahead let me know what do you think well you mean like affirmative
(2:00:36) action no not just affirmative action but this would apply to sex as well right so do you think that uh for
(2:00:43) instance that Democrat policies in their police departments in their major metropolitan areas that they're more
(2:00:49) likely to lower standards so that women can become police officers or raise them
(2:00:54) what do you think i think it's not it's a little more competent though i think a lot of people are they're probably lowering the standards because no one
(2:00:59) wants to be a cop anymore and so they're not desperate let's allow Let's allow more
(2:01:08) officers they need to fight with you guys when you agree with me already they're lowering standards give me a [ __ ] break with this [ __ ] cops are
(2:01:16) already pretty [ __ ] low so yeah I know wouldn't you like to see them raised up and have like I don't know men
(2:01:22) out there in the field who actually are Bronny and can not get their gun taken away from them and shot dead which is
(2:01:27) what happens to women constantly in this job cuz they can't do it constantly constantly yeah constantly
(2:01:34) okay well here I'll tell you what just like getting shot constantly right
(2:01:40) things are constantly happening why are happening what are you talking about no I know i'm being I'm being ironic
(2:01:46) because How is that ironic how is that ironic though because it is happening so there's no
(2:01:53) irony it is happening i'm saying you're exaggerating these stats just like some
(2:01:58) people exaggerate the like unarmed black people shooting here's my question to you then Ghosty would you say that
(2:02:05) standards are being lowered so that more women can join the police department to do the same jobs that men are doing out
(2:02:12) in the field or that they're raising them they're raising which one do you think is more likely i would love to
(2:02:17) know your answer to this more likely are actually happening at both
(2:02:24) well invest investing into like education and like making better officers that implies like they're raising the standard because they're
(2:02:30) talking about the physical standards talking about the physical standards do you think that they're raising them or lowering them for women you don't think
(2:02:36) there's like any like like like physical courses in here it's not just like I I can tell you they they are lowered um I
(2:02:43) was in the military they were lowered for me um how you got in well in the military yeah but Well there are It
(2:02:50) depends on the job right but there are specific uh like your PFTs are always lowered uh the amount of even the the
(2:02:58) actual physical the actual like instead of pull-ups you actually do the hanging
(2:03:03) arm thing or whatever like it's weird it's really weird
(2:03:09) i think there there's a false perception like that we always need like a big brrawy officer like sometimes we actually need like people that are more
(2:03:14) like educated have education on mental issues and how to deal with that not every not every not every case that
(2:03:20) actually most of the cases people call for are mental issues that don't involve any violence but we should probably like
(2:03:25) think about how to address those not just women who are police officers should be paper pushers and come out to
(2:03:31) be nice to people when they need nice people to come out and be nice to them i agree with you so you want more mental
(2:03:37) health within law enforcement based on how that's a big percentage of
(2:03:43) the what they have to address on the dayto-day yeah we should probably address that do you understand that that when you introduce mental health care
(2:03:49) into uh law enforcement you obliterate due process entirely
(2:03:56) please explain wait wait mental health assessment so like when police are
(2:04:01) called What good is an assessment if it's not enforceable no no no i'm talking about people that
(2:04:07) have like education so like you might you might be more equipped to like address someone who has mental issues whereas if you're cop you don't have
(2:04:12) education you might be prone to like do something more negative or someone does something more outrageous where
(2:04:18) some education you might not have effect none of this education and assessments
(2:04:23) none of this [ __ ] is any good unless it's enforceable right how how wouldn't it be enforceable
(2:04:30) that's what I'm saying when you enforce mental health what you're say what you're saying is that you're not you're bypassing due process entirely no no no
(2:04:38) i'm not saying I'm not saying to train people to understand mental health so that it can be used as an excuse in
(2:04:44) court i'm saying that they can so they're properly trained to be able to deal with these people properly in the
(2:04:50) safest way possible okay you're not talking as as a remedial measure you're not talking about in lie
(2:04:56) of punishment or in addition to punishment you get mental health treatment you're talking about deescalation technique yes yes yeah well
(2:05:02) if I mean but that would that would gut the police force entirely because most of those people are there because
(2:05:08) they've got a chip on their shoulder but most of the kinds they're addressing like that they're getting phone calls
(2:05:13) are are nonviolent like issues related to mental health so why would you not be prepared to address those issues well
(2:05:19) what do you mean by addressing those issues do you mean as the court assigns treatment or do you mean like the cop
(2:05:25) knows how to deescalate the cop knows how to deescalate that's what I'm talking about okay well that's fine cops
(2:05:31) don't want to deescalate half the time but um yeah no I'm all for that maybe you should invest in education so they
(2:05:37) get better at that you can't educate somebody out of being an [ __ ]
(2:05:42) maybe you can change the standards of who you're having applied for a job that might have an effect also
(2:05:47) I think you'd have to change the laws to where you're actually uh enforcing laws that have victims you're protecting
(2:05:52) victims instead of just finding victims for the industry the criminal justice
(2:05:57) industry all of them against what you're proposing so yeah that's like what we're doing now is
(2:06:04) we're finding victims right instead of Well I mean most of the most of the
(2:06:10) prison inmates are nonviolent uh conditional like parole violations or
(2:06:16) drug use right there's no victims in these things yeah well that's why I said
(2:06:21) earlier I don't even think any like non-violent criminals should be in jail anyways i I think there should be some
(2:06:28) kind of like working system like where you have to like work without getting paid for a certain amount or like work
(2:06:34) like a very minimum you shouldn't have to go to prison you should be a slave like almost like it like if you do like
(2:06:40) tax evasion like you uh instead of making a regular salary you would make like a very Can we get can we get back
(2:06:47) to policies here trump Harris policies we can get to the back we can get to that in one I do want to say just I'm
(2:06:52) seeing a big difference between me and Flo and the some other people other side where me and Ghosty are free to admit like paracism issues like I think a lot
(2:06:58) of us like don't love 100% of her policies in our campaign but we're willing to admit where they have issues
(2:07:04) and where there can be improvements where I'm not really seeing that from the other side of the aisle any I see Flo you're better at
(2:07:10) this but I'm not seeing anyone willing to talk like about the issues Trump has in fact anytime we bring them up it's like you guys just want to like
(2:07:16) offiscate them or like go past them as as soon as possible what did I offiscate Like way earlier when I gave a claim
(2:07:23) like about the economy every time I gave us a solution you kind of like no let's not talk about that but anytime we bring
(2:07:28) a solution you want to drill down and go a new solution give me the specific example go ahead no you're doing you're
(2:07:34) doing it right now so I want to say why don't you show what am I doing i literally asking you for the specific
(2:07:39) thing I'm talking about what are you talking about i'm asking you to say what Palm news has with Trump's campaign he
(2:07:44) must have at least one so why don't you tell me one wait I'm I'm sorry i'm here to have a debate with you on policy
(2:07:52) claims and on Trump versus Harris i'm not here to give you ammunition against my claims you [ __ ] i'm here to have a
(2:08:00) debate with you i'm not here I'm not here to tell you things I don't like about Trump i'm here to defend my
(2:08:06) position i'm not here to make your arguments for you why don't I tell you something I don't like you can critique
(2:08:12) [ __ ] you give me an argument [ __ ] give me an argument if you make the argument for them it actually Yeah I'll make the
(2:08:18) argument for you is there anything else I can do for you can I get you a cup of tea can I get you some crumpets can I
(2:08:23) help what else can I [ __ ] help you out with boys boys it's called good faith not having like reverse that's not
(2:08:29) good faith but good faith is doing your job and debating [ __ ] now debate don't ask me to debate for you
(2:08:36) don't ask me to give you talking don't ask me to help you out don't ask me to make your position i want to respond to
(2:08:42) your to your question so my next my next contentious or concern is promoters they're in a cult they don't want to
(2:08:47) admit any of his failings that's another reason why we probably shouldn't have him in office his supporters are they
(2:08:53) can't admit one thing wrong with him that's illogical there's many examples yeah okay here I'll I'll go ahead and
(2:08:59) respond this is a completely illogical claim here's what my opponent just did this is how low tier this [ __ ] guy is
(2:09:05) he just said to me I'm here in a debate i've gotten my ass absolutely stomped
(2:09:11) out and I want Andrew to tell me a thing about Trump that I can then critique
(2:09:17) that he agrees with and he won't are you [ __ ] serious with this if I had a
(2:09:22) million issues with Trump I am not here to tell them to you i am here to debate
(2:09:27) the perspective on Kla versus Harris i am not here to make your arguments for you and make concessions for you and
(2:09:34) kiss your ass and hold your [ __ ] hand in a debate make your arguments i know what you're I know you're trying to say it that way but what I'm trying to point
(2:09:40) out is your clear delusion and how you can't be good faith in this discussion where we say logical there are some
(2:09:45) issues with Harris but overall it's going to be way better where you can't do the same i just show
(2:09:53) I'm going to explain I'm going to explain how illogical this is okay and I'll just do it with a Socratic critique it'll take us two seconds is it possible
(2:10:01) that I have many issues with Trump i assume so okay great
(2:10:07) why do I need to tell you what those issues are during a debate where I'm defending the positions of Trump you
(2:10:14) idiot he's pointing out that sometimes just being honest and good faith to have like an actual it is good faith i'm the
(2:10:21) most good faith to go in an actual good direction about what are you talking about instead of just being like I have
(2:10:26) to be right and I have to win can I put it to you can I put it to you this way if this were a court case it would be
(2:10:33) good faith for me to help you out with your arguments about Trump it would be patronizing
(2:10:39) okay you know what here okay here's my biggest my biggest issue with Trump okay
(2:10:45) you ready i'll I'll I'll be as good faith as I possibly can my biggest issue
(2:10:50) with Trump is that on his way out with the deportation buses he doesn't round up every [ __ ] progressive and send
(2:10:55) them out with them that's my biggest issue with Trump he's not authoritarian enough if he was I'd be more happy when
(2:11:01) I went and cast a ballot for him is that Is that helpful to you
(2:11:06) you're a monster i know it does make you seem a little bit more reasonable i got to be honest
(2:11:14) i'm not I'm not here to make arguments for you give you positions assist you in
(2:11:21) critiquing the position I'm here to defend that's the dumbest thing I've That's the second dumbest thing I've
(2:11:28) heard all week in this one debate tonight and man I hear some stupid [ __ ] all day gotta tell you why would I be
(2:11:35) here to help you with your position i think it's totally defended to like defend someone defend your world you also mention what his flaws and
(2:11:41) critiques i think that's why I need to mention his flaws defending him cuz your
(2:11:46) I assume your goal is like need to get the truth it's like you want to have honest discussion where like you you don't want to hide stuff for like the
(2:11:51) benefit of being right you know how you get to the truth truthful answer unlike they get to the truth through argumentation and who has superior
(2:11:57) arguments i have superior arguments to you and that's how people get to the truth how they don't get to the truth is
(2:12:04) when you beg on your knees like a dog that I hold your [ __ ] hand and tell you how to make your arguments against
(2:12:10) the candidate i'm here to defend that's nuts you need to learn how to debate sir this makes me think that you were like
(2:12:16) kind of disingenuely defending the tariffs earlier because I was curious i was like serious curious seriously
(2:12:22) curious about how you could be just so gungho about them and just so like supportive of them when literally nobody
(2:12:30) is and and it just must be because you have to be defending Trump people are what do you mean do you are you aware
(2:12:36) that throughout US history before there was an income tax the primary way in which we got our revenue was through
(2:12:42) tariffs the United States has already used protection tariffs you yourself a reason we don't do that anymore yeah
(2:12:47) because we shifted the burden on to the individual with the income tax which is [ __ ] insane do you like paying the
(2:12:54) income tax or would you rather the billionaire and terrorists put the burden on the
(2:12:59) consumers it doesn't do anything so the corporate taxes do you understand that right this second if you would actually
(2:13:07) tax the imported goods coming from other countries that have a surplus you would not need to pay an income tax you
(2:13:14) wouldn't have to do that and you're demanding that you do that cuz you're so [ __ ] stupid and brainwashed that you
(2:13:21) think that you paying income taxes somehow is necessary for this country to run it's not we're a massive economy
(2:13:28) everybody wants access to our market with bringing jobs back how did we raise revenue before we had we don't need back
(2:13:35) to America how did we raise revenue before we had an income tax how did we do it
(2:13:42) it's irrelevant because it's not irrelevant answer the question from back then it is today trade is no different
(2:13:48) than economy trade's no different totally different world trade's no different trade is trade is trade trade
(2:13:54) is trade so real quick real quick i just want I just want an answer how do you think we raised revenue before there was
(2:13:59) an income tax how do you think we did it
(2:14:04) you don't know you have no [ __ ] idea i don't know the Yeah okay well here I'm going to help you here's how we raised
(2:14:10) revenue we did it through tariffs and nobody had to pay an income tax they got to keep that they didn't have their income wages that's a brand new thing
(2:14:17) it's an invention of the 20th century and it was written by bankers there's literally this was written by bankers
(2:14:25) into law they had Nelson Aldrich uh by the way who was against it i believe he
(2:14:30) was poisoned later right uh the I'm not even going to get into this because it's insane but I'm just telling you very
(2:14:37) quickly that you yourself would not have to pay the income tax if you would take
(2:14:44) the countries that have a trade surplus with us and tear off their [ __ ] goods we would raise so much revenue that
(2:14:51) Ghosty would never get another dime taken out of her paycheck you could offset it you could literally offset it
(2:14:56) now you'd have to do some things with unfunded liabilities but good they're unfunded liabilities we probably
(2:15:03) shouldn't have those either that's a really bad idea that's really weird that none of that is a part of like Trump's
(2:15:09) plan or argument his literally Trump has said multiple times in speeches that he
(2:15:15) would love to get rid of the income tax with tariff revenue he's literally said it would you like me to send you the
(2:15:20) clip sure if you have offh hand uh but
(2:15:29) we can do a followup with that sure um okay does everybody feel like they've
(2:15:36) gotten their points out all right i thought closing statements
(2:15:42) yes that's where we're going to move to now um we can start over with Andrew and
(2:15:47) work our way back if you'd like to do that andrew yeah this was simple my opponents got absolutely [ __ ]
(2:15:53) obliterated they're dumb as a box of rocks i don't even know why they came out for this debate they have no idea what they're talking about they have no
(2:15:59) idea about any policies they had no idea they literally had no idea about anything they don't know anything about
(2:16:04) US history they don't know anything about how it is that we raise revenue in this country right they're just a bunch
(2:16:11) of mindless [ __ ] NPCs and what happens is NPCs are told every single day that they're special boys and
(2:16:18) special girls and that they're super smart because they believe the science and they believe the economist and then
(2:16:23) when you put them to the question you find out they're a bunch of clueless [ __ ] morons don't know anything about any issues at all never know anything
(2:16:29) about any issues the informed public on the other hand the conservatives like myself right we actually know what the
(2:16:36) [ __ ] is going on that's why we obliterate these people day in day out super simple they have untenable
(2:16:42) worldviews they don't know anything about anything demonstrated over and over and over no matter this this was so
(2:16:49) bad that these people demanded that I give them arguments that they could critique against me because that's the
(2:16:55) only way I could be good faith to them and then what they do is they say "Well we had to concede on a bunch of arguments because we're so dumb we can't
(2:17:02) make them." But so I but I think it would be good faith if you would go ahead and make concessions on things you
(2:17:08) don't like either so we can critique those it's the most low tier [ __ ] I've ever seen in my life i have no idea what
(2:17:13) the hell they're even doing here obliterated this was easy i just had a debate with counterpoints last night a
(2:17:19) million times smarter than both of you combined and that guy made way better arguments he got blown out too you
(2:17:24) should be ashamed of yourself you should immediately stop doing this until you figure out how to be good at it because
(2:17:30) this was one of the most disappointing debates I've had all [ __ ] year you're pathetic and I'll leave it with that
(2:17:37) thank you so kindly flow state to you i'm just going to go get some aloe vera for all those burns
(2:17:44) um yeah no uh I still think even though clearly the the conservative platform is
(2:17:51) less harmful than the liberal one uh ultimately at the end of the day we are still dealing with two wings of the same
(2:17:56) bird they're both walking us in the same direction just at different rates and none of them represent you
(2:18:04) thank you flow state prawn to you thanks um I guess I'll start off by
(2:18:10) addressing um the income tax history i wonder if there's a reason like why we changed from the income tax or sorry
(2:18:16) from the tariffs to the income tax maybe there's a reason why we made that change and we've been doing that for a long ass time i it seems like Andrew is okay with
(2:18:22) disagreeing with like the majority of uh economist i'm not okay with doing that i'm not an expert though maybe he is
(2:18:28) i'll admit that um I do think overall um I'll get I'm going I'm going to site the
(2:18:33) economist you say overall there's probably be a way bigger benefit to the middle class uh in a a Trump sorry in a
(2:18:40) Harris campaign presidency versus the a Trump one where that's definely going to be more affected by the rich they're
(2:18:46) going to get way better um and I like how you're trying to tweak what I was trying to say what I'm trying to
(2:18:51) demonstrate is you know I can I can make what Harris is uh has has her issues i think that's way better for getting to
(2:18:56) like a final solution where you get we're all on the same page being truthful i think when you like aren't
(2:19:02) willing to admit your your party's issues like that's when it gets really uh hard to have clear and honest communication that's what I was trying
(2:19:08) to get to i came here uh a little bit openminded uh I'm voting tomorrow so my vote is not solidified but uh I was not
(2:19:15) convinced uh I'm probably still going to vote for Harris i'll just say that all right thank you ghosty Teal okay uh I
(2:19:22) don't know if this is allowed for my closing statement am I allowed to ask Andrew a very simple question a yes or
(2:19:28) no question that's if if you'll entertain it Andrew that's totally up to you
(2:19:35) i think he's talking to his people right now okay um I was going to Hang on hang
(2:19:40) on i'll agree to this i'll agree to this but it can't be a loaded question here's what I mean by that like if I said "Hey
(2:19:46) Ghosty when did you stop prostitution?" That would be a loaded question right that would that would be what that would
(2:19:51) be as long as this question is not loaded I'll answer it yes or no if it's loaded I'm not going to answer it okay
(2:19:57) it's your choice whether or not to answer it um do you believe in dinosa
(2:20:02) do I believe in them yeah do you believe in dinosaurs i don't i'm sure what
(2:20:12) okay that's my closing statement do I believe in them do you think dinosaurs were real
(2:20:18) i mean I think that there's was at some point giant reptiles that walked around
(2:20:24) do I think that uh people who uh started in the bone wars made many many many
(2:20:31) mistakes yes okay
(2:20:38) what did that By the way by the way remember how you were talking earlier about good faith sir see what that was
(2:20:44) right there because she was wrecked so badly she wanted to end this by saying "I was arguing with a person who doesn't
(2:20:51) even believe in dinosaurs." That was what the [ __ ] That was literally what
(2:20:57) she just tried to do there mr good Faith maybe Maybe you should put a check i definitely don't
(2:21:03) i don't think so you got proof where's the proof i mean your wife doesn't and And I'm sorry i'm sorry what's my
(2:21:12) name what's my name he said he lives we can We can pick yeah is my name Rachel
(2:21:18) Wilson or is it Andrew Wilson yeah okay okay then i'm sorry that was a
(2:21:25) great gotcha go you really had me on the roofs for that one anyway I'll go let you go back to your closer he doesn't
(2:21:31) did you have any more final thoughts to that ghosty outside of that um
(2:21:39) uh I don't know i'm good harris 2024 they're lying about Well that's
(2:21:45) convincing they're lying about the tariffs it's going to be Everybody agrees terrible so how would you
(2:21:52) possibly know that i have an econ degree literally I was a loan officer last time
(2:21:58) I talked to you like a week ago you said you don't believe in tariffs like you said you think tariffs are generally
(2:22:04) always no I didn't yes you did they're always what I said is they're always a market
(2:22:11) inefficiency and then I gave And then I gave a reason on the other side why [ __ ] why you would want them actually they
(2:22:17) are kind of a market inefficiency if we don't have enough of them no they're always a market inefficiency but that's
(2:22:23) okay because if we export too much over time we're sending all of our capital
(2:22:28) out and if China owns America we got a bigger issue than just high prices
(2:22:36) all right uh let's just move on to the super chats if you don't mind jeff Bader comes in with the big 50 hey Ghost can I
(2:22:42) ask you a question how do you think Tyrannosaurus has had sex oh I'm done
(2:22:49) like honestly how do you think a Tyrannosaurus Rex with its arms like this how do you think it had sex with
(2:22:56) another Tyrannosaur what do you think what do you think the process for that was since you're an expert on dinosaurs I've always wondered how do you think a
(2:23:02) T-Rex has sex with another T-Rex what do you think they do i don't believe in dinosaurs Dio probably laying down what
(2:23:08) do you mean i'm just asking you a question you're the dinosaur expert here how do you think a T-Rex has sex it's
(2:23:13) really weird right the little arms like they can't even get any friction like they can't grab that bitch's shoulders and really give it to her right they
(2:23:20) kind of they kind of have to like I like I don't know like how is it done have you seen their legs though they're
(2:23:25) probably like power bottoms you know they got lots of but I mean but how do they lay on their back with their tail
(2:23:31) and [ __ ] they got really big mouths though i I just I'm not sure i'm not sure how that works Ghost as a dinosaur
(2:23:36) expert I was just hoping you could help me out with that that's all i'm picturing like It's kind of like reverse cow cowgirl
(2:23:44) yeah I'll accept that can we agree that T-Rexes give the worst
(2:23:50) [ __ ] oh they have to they have to right i mean there's no way there's no way all those teeth oh man is that why
(2:23:57) they're all honory do you think that that the T-Rex was so honory because they had all them teeth and no toothbrush ghosty is that why the T-Rex
(2:24:04) was so honory that's crocodiles I think yeah but I mean that's like a descendant of the T-Rex right true true yeah yeah
(2:24:10) so I mean it's it it it stands to reason you know if you have to eat like thousands of pounds of meat a day and
(2:24:16) [ __ ] look you proved if you really believe in dinosaurs you're you're uh you know a step ahead above than what I
(2:24:23) Well I'm just asking how the T-Rex [ __ ] i don't know how they [ __ ] you know this is this could be brought up on whatever it could be the ghosty question
(2:24:30) that Brian Atlas can ask on the next whatever podcast how did a T-Rex bone
(2:24:35) another T-Rex with those small arms how do they get the f You know what I mean like you know how most mammals and reptile they like grab their shoulders
(2:24:42) they're really giving it to them you know i don't know how I don't know how they do it with the small arms ghost i
(2:24:47) just don't know you know there's like species without arms that procreate okay they put I'm just saying I'm just saying
(2:24:54) like they're giant they're giant animals i'm just I'm not sure how they get that forward inertia you know that's all I'm
(2:24:59) saying on the back of the female i'm just asking questions that's all I'm asking i
(2:25:04) ask you you believe in dinosaurs i'm very proud of you yeah can I say one more thing before we get to super chats uh Sarah I do want to say thank you for
(2:25:11) putting this together thank you Ghosty Flo and thanks Andrew for coming here i know you want me to quit debating but uh
(2:25:17) I'm just starting off anytime soon so now listen listen here's my olive branch i do not want you to quit debating i
(2:25:23) want you to get better and come back here and whoop my ass that's what I want i've only been doing this for a little
(2:25:29) bit so I'll try to get better just for you i'm not like a big political person to
(2:25:34) be fair but still like it just it
(2:25:39) doesn't take much to know that Harris is going to be better this is just
(2:25:45) Trump but it sure isn't thank god you made it this is why women
(2:25:51) experts agree with it the experts agree with it the numbers show it everything you guys can deny it you guys don't
(2:25:57) believe in experts you know it's all propaganda whatever don't believe in experts what are you talking about i I I'll think for myself
(2:26:04) you should think for yourself too why the [ __ ] would you outsource thinking i trust I trust tons of experts what do
(2:26:09) you mean but you're clearly you're clearly not one of them so I'm not going to trust you and let's look at this just
(2:26:16) just this approach to life just outsource your thinking to other people and trust that they have your best interest in mind is absurd no it's when
(2:26:23) I when I'm not an econ an economist i I go to economists to to go various Do you
(2:26:30) understand what a conflict of interest is do you understand what a conflict of interest is
(2:26:36) yes do you think that economists could have a conflict of interest when the person
(2:26:42) paying them has a preferred outcome
(2:26:48) yeah but there are so many different ones that agree with this
(2:26:53) all of them have the same boss i know all of them are getting paid by the same person okay and economists care about
(2:26:59) their money right so if they care about their money they would want they would economist don't have any president
(2:27:05) economists don't have any money they're the worst investors ever econ if you want to make investors investments you
(2:27:11) go to investment bankers you don't go to economists they don't they're [ __ ] broke economists are propaganda
(2:27:19) it's tax it's people who do the taxes like I've listened to economists
(2:27:26) i I know they're saying more than just economists i've listened to the tax
(2:27:31) people on this the economists on this the investor people on this and they all are saying Harris's plan is much better
(2:27:37) truth doesn't come from authority do you know that well I think the problem is we can't even trust what Trump is saying himself
(2:27:43) you can't trust what any president says ever they've been lying to you can I can I ask a serious question real quick i
(2:27:49) don't ask i don't give a [ __ ] about this election that much to be honest well
(2:27:54) Ghosty can I can I just ask you a serious question real quick if I could demonstrate to you that most of the
(2:28:00) economists were in agreement that Trump was going to crash the stock market and they were wrong would you still trust
(2:28:07) them in this election if I could demonstrate that for you uh I don't know if I'm looking at the
(2:28:13) same economists that that uh if I give you the same ones and I guarantee you
(2:28:18) it's the same ones if I were to demonstrate that they were all wrong about their predictions that Trump would
(2:28:24) crash the stock market and instead it went to new highs never before seen would you still trust the same economist
(2:28:30) not on the stock market but maybe on a different Yeah so so it wouldn't matter like so so ultimately for you it doesn't
(2:28:38) really matter what the facts are it just matters what the consensus is and right think and because all that matters for
(2:28:44) you is right think right that's why I believe that your opinions are [ __ ]
(2:28:49) completely irrelevant and I couldn't change your mind no matter what and I don't believe for a second this gentleman was an undecided voter i don't
(2:28:54) believe for a second that even though I pummeled his entire worldview showed him how stupid it was he was always going to
(2:29:00) vote for Kamla stop lying to me guys just stop it's It's just not a good look stop it
(2:29:08) okay i just ask one thing i think this be fun i think this will cause more debate but just I think it' be fun andrew are you
(2:29:14) willing to do a little bet with me i think we have a caveat this where it'd be this only be if Trump wins the presidency it' be cool like putting $100
(2:29:21) to see if you'd actually do the deportation numbers he's talking about how much is he talking about i can find
(2:29:27) exact quote but we can like we can al pick a number just agree agree upon but I think that'd be kind of fun to do the exact number for that is Yeah that he
(2:29:33) will do better on deportations than Biden and he will allow less illegal immigrants in than Biden you want to
(2:29:39) make a thousand bet on that i think I'm going to find a specific number and then we can like go back and
(2:29:44) forth if we if we No how about this how about this how about that this This is super more than Biden i can't less
(2:29:51) illegals in and he will he will ultimately have better deportation well
(2:29:57) actually no he won't have better deportation he'll simple simple net number hang on
(2:30:02) simple he will let less illegal immigrants into the country than Joseph Biden how's that
(2:30:09) you mean then her i don't like the first part because I think he definitely will probably do better uh he'll probably clamp on immigration so I don't disagree
(2:30:14) with that part okay the thing the thing I disagree the thing I disagree upon is
(2:30:20) that he won't he won't actually do he won't do the mass deportation that's part of his major that's what I'm addressing bro you don't have as many to
(2:30:26) deport you don't have as many to deport if you don't let as many in and if you're saying that Trump already
(2:30:32) let you think bro I don't think he'll do the deportation already slowing down
(2:30:38) anyways the problem was there was a global mass immigration thing and like sure you can say Biden didn't handle
(2:30:45) that right i agree with that oh he handled it the absolute opposite of what you would do if you were trying to stop
(2:30:50) it can we just I just say I offered a simple a simple bet that will basically prompt do what he promises in his
(2:30:57) campaign with his core pillars and you're like no I'm not going to do that okay well then here uh did would you
(2:31:02) make the bet that under um Harris that inflation will go up higher than
(2:31:08) economists predict right now i'll put the same $100 bet on it that inflation
(2:31:13) will go up higher than economist that if if Harris wins okay that inflation will
(2:31:19) go up higher than economists are currently predicting in your model under under a Harris president
(2:31:25) presidency yes let me think about it but I might be open to that no you might be yeah okay these these these bets are fun
(2:31:32) for me so I'm okay if I if I lose but but here's something we could say is that I think that Trump will let in far
(2:31:37) less illegals than Biden did and if you say you won't take that bet then that means that you believe already that that
(2:31:43) Trump's going to be better on the border than Biden so your argument is defeated either way it's silly you should just go
(2:31:48) vote for Trump it's a good idea just go vote for Trump keep the illegals out
(2:31:57) i know you love to repeat points but I never said that like uh Harris is going to do a lot better on on closing the
(2:32:02) border vote for nobody and stop beating the paradigm that's being used to control you we we repeat these talking
(2:32:09) with nothing i don't want to watch your [ __ ] lesbian smut if you could take that down that'd be great

(2:39:42) comes in with another Big 10 thank you Sarah for being a W host just keep in mind that Trumpers not conservatives
(2:39:48) want less for you they want to make your lives worse for their benefit t-rex compensates by having a long
(2:39:59) be h the dinosaur one got me that one definitely got me good so that's uh I
(2:40:07) wonder what everyone knows that oh yeah why the thing is thing is is like uh process if you want if you want
(2:40:15) to kind of up your debate skills when it comes to rhetoric right remember that people always have a cheap gotcha right
(2:40:21) but you can always turn one around you can always turn one around
(2:40:27) yes we can turn them around um that's that's all I see for now um in
(2:40:35) terms of uh we went 10 and up damn Don Juan was doing so good with the Big 20 and now he's back to his normal [ __ ]
(2:40:42) yeah ask deter Ask Andrew about I'm simply afraid I could not answer any of
(2:40:48) his questions about that Don Juan play for less than $50 to Sarah's channel how does that make you feel how does that
(2:40:53) make you feel don Juan he named our ring so maybe we can have that combo a different day as a T-Rex I can confirm
(2:41:01) that intercourse is very problematic stop it you guys
(2:41:09) I'm kind of curious but I also don't want to Google that at all i kind of want to
(2:41:20) oh sorry i feel like there's other more problematic dinosaurs if you think about it stegosaurus
(2:41:28) stegosaurus yeah but wouldn't they wouldn't Wouldn't they have sex like turtles have sex
(2:41:33) though like they would just basically How do That's a good question well they
(2:41:38) they just like crawl up each other's shells right i don't know how do they do that yeah can't t Can't some turtles
(2:41:45) like not turn themselves over if they get Don't they lay eggs though dicks like really i don't know
(2:41:52) shoot again so if you Google T-Rex sex the images are [ __ ] up dude don't do
(2:42:00) that [ __ ] DJ Flow State stop it stop it bro
(2:42:06) well surely this But surely this this question has been addressed by somebody uh you know somebody asked whose job it
(2:42:13) is what's the What's the rule i'm trying to remember what the rule is the rule it goes like this somebody somebody in the
(2:42:19) chat helped me out with this but the rule is if it exists there's porn of it
(2:42:24) and is that rule 34 or something yeah 34 i think it's 34 if there's if it exists there's porn of it and if there's not
(2:42:30) porn of it yet somebody's making it i think that's the rule is it 30 yeah it
(2:42:35) says rule 34 rule 34 okay what's crazy you said phobia someone's definitely written a thesis paper on that subject
(2:42:41) in particular just happened for sure it's happened yeah research into how exactly dinosaurs mated um or in fact
(2:42:49) anything at all about how they hooked up has drawn a total blank to this day scientists can't even accurately disting
(2:42:55) distinguish males from females yeah isn't that strange trust the J i trust
(2:43:00) the science trust they don't know i do trust the
(2:43:06) science there's no bones to be able to tell right i do trust the science right they don't know and I don't know that's
(2:43:12) all I'm saying they don't know i don't know nobody knows
(2:43:17) scientists admit they're wrong i think it's a good thing you should do i I think so too and the second you
(2:43:24) prove that I'm wrong I'll admit it oh goodness uh Christopher Scott coming in
(2:43:30) with the big 20 thanks for the setup Sarah yes you are most welcome

(2:44:43) would have figured it out man I was just thinking that i thought I was done with it you'd already won that in my mind and then you didn't mute yeah I didn't mute
(2:44:50) i know i failed that's [ __ ] integrity though there's a W for integrity what I'm saying like you blew it bro you
(2:44:56) [ __ ] blew it unacceptable i'm so disappointed even I
(2:45:01) can do a shot of this [ __ ] worthless Andrew it's too bad all these L's are
(2:45:06) coming out after the debate all right that's when they're
(2:45:12) allowed mr boule comes in with a big 20 this super chat is sponsored by Tactical
(2:45:18) Soap from Brondike Soap Company covered in weak arguments that hangs on mindlessly use the soap that'll cleanse
(2:45:26) progressives into submission get the win with tactical soap today thank you Mr boule he said "Never
(2:45:33) double swallow." Double
(2:45:39) swallow that's terrible never never double swallow everybody knows that oh my goodness i like now I
(2:45:47) wish I had some vodka oh and Datalus
(2:45:53) Datalus interesting names uh comes in with a big 10 for the grift ghosty do you believe in absolute truth that one's
(2:46:00) to you uh no is that true
(2:46:08) no oh is that true though but but what about that is that true that's what I mean i don't know i don't but is it true
(2:46:15) that you don't know i don't think I don't think we I think there is an absolute truth i don't know if humans
(2:46:22) know it though so there is absolute truth okay
(2:46:28) i don't know if we can like obtain it though if it's perceivable is that kind
(2:46:35) that's fair somebody said "Oops Andrew forgot how to drink." Listen my Irish forebears are not
(2:46:43) looking down on me right now this is not cope this is not cope
(2:46:52) it's a little bit third time okay but hey here's the
(2:46:57) thing one more i'll have the wife bring down one more but it's a normal shot and this time if I don't cough I'm not sure
(2:47:03) that's a total redeemer but it's like a partial redeemer right uh if you if you mess up a third one
(2:47:12) dude we have to just keep taking shots until you get it right
(2:47:18) that's the motivation you can't end on an L vote this This one's actually nice from
(2:47:27) Holly Dolly she says "Can you each say something nice about the other by the end on a by the end end on a positive
(2:47:35) note?" Sure i'll start uh so I do admire the tenacity of uh both interlocators
(2:47:41) i've seen Ghosty uh punch up going against people who are way above her weight class when it comes to debate and
(2:47:49) she still shows up and I do think that she tries her hardest and I have respect
(2:47:54) for that because um you know when people are young they're kind of foolish and
(2:47:59) they say foolish things and they think foolish things and I think that punching up actually has been helpful to her
(2:48:04) ideology i see her softening up on some positions that she was a little bit more adamant on before uh trying to kind of
(2:48:12) understand the other side so I will say that and then moving over to the other guy i don't know him right and he just
(2:48:19) had really terrible arguments but I would try to give you the same type of advice right which is like keep punching
(2:48:25) up bro there's not that many creators who are my size who will interlock but if you can get them get them keep on
(2:48:30) fighting the good fight from your angle right put this up now our last convo yeah
(2:48:37) uh and did would anybody else like to say something nice oh yeah but Flo State's a stupid libertarian [ __ ]
(2:48:42) [ __ ] there's that and I'm not saying anything [ __ ] nice about him i could have had a way better debate partner Rob
(2:48:49) No but I think he did okay he did okay i'll accept it okay you don't need a
(2:48:55) debate partner though i've acknowledged this i've recognized you no I actually prefer to go one v [ __ ] 10 if we can
(2:49:02) do it i'm I'm I can get you 10 if you want 10 let's do it gang bang oh what
(2:49:08) the [ __ ] dude are you immediately Okay
(2:49:14) all right we're going to get the coughing out of the way here we go you can't pre-cough you're just irritating
(2:49:19) your throat more that's going to that's going to [ __ ] you up more while he does this shot somebody else say something nice about Andrew i want to see him
(2:49:26) cough over the nice thing as much as I always as much as I completely disagree with Andrew on almost everything he is
(2:49:32) very polite and uh welcoming to debate with and I never feel like I don't know
(2:49:40) like a I can't think of the word but it's it's a very nice like debating with you
(2:49:45) you're very uh personable I guess to debate with which I wasn't which I wouldn't expect i
(2:49:52) wasn't expecting when I first did that so he's a sweetheart is that what you're saying well The
(2:49:58) Crucible has always had a non-harassment policy my job my job is to represent my
(2:50:04) worldview and the worldview of my audience the best way that I possibly can and that's what I come to do but
(2:50:11) once the debate is done we do not harass creators we do not bother creators we don't do any of that [ __ ] we just
(2:50:17) don't do it so uh my job is to destroy your ideology and make it as public as
(2:50:23) possible my job is not to destroy your life
(2:50:28) oh I'm do my nice bits too uh unless Andrew doing your shot you want to do your shot first yeah you ready give him
(2:50:34) the compliment right in the middle of it yes please what are you going to Are you not doing one with me i don't have
(2:50:40) anything to shoot you [ __ ] Milly mouth scumbags i'm the only one nobody i
(2:50:45) got I got something i'll go double check i don't think Ready here we go i have I
(2:50:50) have rum don't Don't hold it no breathe through

(2:51:07) that was a Hang on okay so it doesn't it doesn't absolve me but I feel
(2:51:14) like I I don't even know it doesn't absolve me but I'm hoping that there'll be some mercy i'm going to throw myself
(2:51:20) on the mercy of the chat my chat is remarkably unmerciful especially to me they have no [ __ ]
(2:51:27) mercy there's like "Oh Andrew took an L." Well then he's [ __ ] then forever more that's how That's how they look at
(2:51:33) it it's [ __ ] you have to You have to match two for two you You got one no no

(2:51:49) process your kind words starting with the goce thanks for being a great debate partner thanks for uh
(2:51:55) taking up some of the airways while I was doing some live research definitely got to stay on on top of research here where there's some uh misinformation
(2:52:01) being thrown out there um but I did definitely enjoy my experience i do like these uh heated debates it makes me
(2:52:06) better a better debater i definitely have some room for improvement i only been doing this for like a month or so uh been streaming for three months
(2:52:13) entering the debate sphere like a month or so pop in the Crucible Discord those guys will set you straight i'm a member
(2:52:20) plenty of progressives there's plenty of progressives in that discord um you you will be in good company uh and yeah
(2:52:27) that'll help sharpen you up there are progressives in there is that what you said oh yeah yeah especially Corinth
(2:52:34) meet Meet a guy so Okay so the the Crucible has one particular
(2:52:41) progressive who's kind of who Okay I hate saying I [ __ ] hate saying this but he's kind of based right but he's a
(2:52:48) [ __ ] progressive but he is a philosophy major he's quite brilliant
(2:52:53) and he is brutal as [ __ ] and sometimes I listen to the guy and I'm like "Fucking
(2:52:59) [ __ ] actually made a good point." And then of course I get in and start tangling with him but the point is is that uh there's some brilliant
(2:53:06) progressives inside of that discord corin's one of them i highly suggest you come in i'm I'm already a member i
(2:53:12) definitely spend some more time in there let me just finish my round of comments uh next flow state uh I've done a couple panels with you it's always fun to
(2:53:18) interact with you uh you're definitely unpredictable you're not uh you don't have always the takes I kind of thought you uh would have when I first met you
(2:53:24) so I you definitely seem like an open-minded individual so I do like that about you i usually enjoy our panels together um and Andrew definitely I
(2:53:31) definitely respect your rhetoric debate ability got to be honest I've had a lot of little debates i think this the first one I would say is pretty challenging uh
(2:53:38) and they're definitely part of the reason sorry it's not that's not like we have dis you flow state um but also
(2:53:43) thank you for coming to these uh smaller panels supporting us and supporting small channels like mine the process please sub i'm I'm small i'm below 500
(2:53:51) subs support me you know what pisses you know what pisses me off i'm going to I
(2:53:57) hate saying this is it something Francis just did uh oh no no your channel what
(2:54:02) actually upsets me this this is something which actually upsets me the support for smaller smaller channels
(2:54:08) smaller streamers people who have you know 100 200 um I was there you know
(2:54:14) what I mean now this debate I averaged I think like 5.5,000 live viewers um I
(2:54:20) learned this actually from Destiny right i learned this actually from Destiny and he I I will say he
(2:54:28) pioneered this idea that there's a lot of smaller creators who are very very
(2:54:34) talented very skilled and interlocking with them early on is a good idea for
(2:54:39) both sides and that guy has always brought smaller creators on and debated
(2:54:45) with them and in many ways that's one of the biggest reasons I respect the guy he's always he's never been like "I'm
(2:54:52) too good to debate you." Now I'm blacklisted by him but even then he ignores the [ __ ] blacklist because we
(2:54:58) end up fighting it out anyway right but in many ways that is what earned me his respect is that he never thought you're
(2:55:05) too small for me to deal with i like that true i like it a lot and I I
(2:55:12) think the you started with the concept of like we were all there once um I mean I'm still there we're like and if if you
(2:55:19) don't allow the smaller creators to uh engage well then you're just holding
(2:55:25) yourself back honestly because you're not allowing room for Destiny's a [ __ ] cummer gremlin piece of [ __ ] and
(2:55:31) I will always be there to be the thorn in his side um because I'm Batman he's
(2:55:37) Joker I guess right that's how his audience sees it but the thing is is ultimately that was a good lesson
(2:55:43) learned and uh I I've always respected him for doing that that's fair that's fair and Jess Gerald
(2:55:50) coming in with the big 50 thanks for hosting you have a great laugh well thank you so much i I I had to mute
(2:55:57) myself several times because I didn't want to interrupt the panel um but
(2:56:02) Andrew Andrew definitely had the dad jokes rolling for me so it was quite comical i love dad jokes so they were
(2:56:09) kind of hitting that on that that realm and Don coming oh I'm sorry uh process
(2:56:15) were you done with your nice words flow state did you want to give nice words
(2:56:20) sure um I think that just I was I was hoping to fly under the radar um no I
(2:56:27) mean everybody's everybody's um I think the the most forefront positive
(2:56:33) attributes that everybody displayed today has already been covered um but I would say definitely um Andrew's ability
(2:56:38) to or willingness to engage with smaller channels um is something that I've always I've always respected and um both
(2:56:46) of you two did stick right the [ __ ] in there um the whole time and didn't get
(2:56:52) upset or pissy or rage quit or anything like that and uh I think a lot of a lot
(2:56:57) of people would have that's fair that's very fair don Juan
(2:57:03) comes in with the Big 10 andrew your Irish forefathers are looking down at your lack of Catholicism they were uh
(2:57:09) grateful when the Spanish helped them against the Calvinists flo don't forget to read Aquinus everyone took L's sorry
(2:57:17) sorry uh Don Juan Plegus but uh my Irish forefathers were actually Orthodox long
(2:57:23) before they were Irish and there was a schism so [ __ ] off
(2:57:31) alter Boyd coming in with a big 10 just wanted to help out but I have one question for the panel if you only have
(2:57:38) one win and you say double or nothing how many wins do you now have
(2:57:44) two one i was thinking one well I have zero
(2:57:49) because I took Jesus because I coughed twice i coughed twice and I couldn't
(2:57:55) redeem myself with the one so if I double or nothing I would actually maybe be at negative
(2:58:00) -2 if it was double or nothing did you take a third one i did
(2:58:06) i redeemed it i redeemed it on number three but it was a normal size you need a fourth one to redeem it
(2:58:14) all right i do I do think a fourth just tell her to bring down the bottle all right she's filling it with water that's
(2:58:20) why he says normal size normal size shot woman one
(2:58:27) more normal size shot he's like He's doing the fake face like "Oh disgusting." Oh this water is so burning
(2:58:34) do Do you want to see to pour it out of the bottle or what i've seen him have those be when we had uh what was it uh
(2:58:42) the sperm the sperm tour one the sperm donor tour he was like actually drinking
(2:58:47) it straight out of the bottle that's what I do i swig it
(2:58:53) oh my goodness no class well here's the thing if anybody ever doubts I will
(2:58:58) literally pour that shot and light that [ __ ] on fire and then you can
(2:59:03) see for sure you can't light water on [ __ ] fire can you
(2:59:09) vodka hang on hang on hang on here we go if you just shake it we go here we go
(2:59:15) water doesn't oh he went for gray goose this time oh is that Belvadier Oh it's Grey Goose gray all right i'm kind of I
(2:59:22) don't think he's faking but what if what if the bottle is filled with water all on camera
(2:59:30) if you want to be really nice on Dave and Buster's shot glass too but yeah if you want to be really safe and secure
(2:59:36) you got to have an unopened unopened bottle open be a [ __ ] hang on no all you have wait
(2:59:45) definitely water bro
(2:59:51) [Music] well Pete Fletch comes in with a good point he says "Uh Andrew also took an L
(2:59:57) due to peer pressure we all sat here and convinced you to do the
(3:00:02) Why do you Why wait why do you think you would ever need to convince me of that?" Look at Look at trying to use peer
(3:00:09) pressure to shame peer pressure it's a weird [ __ ] paradigm there l P Fletch my chat says it's still an L they said
(3:00:15) it's still a [ __ ] L this is [ __ ] andrew just curious at what point does binge drinking become degenerate at what
(3:00:23) well I'm not binge drinking that's ridiculous i'm not saying I'm just wondering at what point
(3:00:28) i I'm kind of meing i'm just wondering if you had an answer to that i assume you're against binge drinking at some point yeah you mean when someone's a
(3:00:34) drunkard degeneracy is the way of the future do you do you Let me ask you a
(3:00:39) question let like let's think about this objectively from the Christian ethics side you know that there are priests who
(3:00:46) are in the middle of their fast like uh a priest came to my home one day and he cleansed it and he was in the middle of
(3:00:53) a fast and I said uh you know father can I offer you some food and he said of
(3:00:58) course and he sat down he had breakfast sausage and eggs and bacon that my wife made him in the middle of a fast because
(3:01:05) what he said to me was though I'm in the middle of a fast I'm never going to turn down the charitable meal of anybody who
(3:01:14) offers me one the idea Well but the idea here is actually very sound and the idea
(3:01:21) here is why would I why would I not break my fast why would I piously signal
(3:01:27) to you that I'm fasting and have you make like a vegetarian omelette for me rather than eating and breaking bread
(3:01:33) with you right now you and I uh we're having drinks we're having a good time
(3:01:40) isn't that the best way that I can really bring you over to my side ultimately I can crush your worldview in
(3:01:46) a debate but can I also break bread with you can I also talk to you where where
(3:01:52) you get to see me i definitely think alcohol consumption is definitely a good bonding experience
(3:01:58) yeah there's a vodka in this cup
(3:02:06) and there you go the thing is here's what I've learned in my some 40 odd
(3:02:12) years on this planet men can't fight over two things if I offer you a steak
(3:02:19) and we're eating we're not punching each other and if I offer you a drink and a steak we become friends
(3:02:30) oh tell me I'm wrong i'm sorry i'm always asking but yeah I
(3:02:37) don't think I just um um and just for the record we will open the panel here
(3:02:42) shortly i always let the panelists have their time and then once everybody who chooses to leave leaves then I'll open
(3:02:48) it up uh if anybody is waiting for that another new account comes in with the Big 10 people like Kyle Kyle
(3:02:54) Writtenhouse and Darren Wilson have and that's the the cops right have had their
(3:02:59) lives ruined by lies pushed by media even some still being repeated after the
(3:03:04) facts are out why shouldn't they go to jail that's a good question um if anybody I think that we
(3:03:12) know the answer to that because I already explained it the the the impact of being able to sue people for free
(3:03:18) speech or I'm sorry criminalize them for free speech is worse than the impact of uh of people
(3:03:26) being able to tell lies the best way to count counter a lie is with truth right you put all the information out there
(3:03:32) and then the truth will rise to the top no it won't is it perfect no it won't
(3:03:37) that's that's dude also like what about algorithms we have the the public square
(3:03:45) as it exists you will admit right now like on Twitter let's take Twitter for
(3:03:51) instance okay only under Elon Musk now can truth rise to the top where's not
(3:03:58) even under Elon Musk where does truth rise to the top on YouTube sir where
(3:04:05) well with debates like this I don't you think some truth rose to the top here rise to the [ __ ] top dude when you say you mean people being able to say
(3:04:12) slurs and and use the f- word and just say rac I agree but but like when you say
(3:04:20) there's no like freedom of speech blah blah blah like I understand some things like that uh some topics like the
(3:04:26) pandemic or 9/11 and stuff like I think these should all be able to be covered without being demonetized and stuff like
(3:04:31) that i think that's stupid but for the most part when people are talking about like I'm not allowed to say this they're
(3:04:37) talking about like the the n-word with the R and [ __ ] like
(3:04:42) well well then explain the delineation you think that people should
(3:04:48) be able to combat what they consider to be misinformation even if that's misinformation what is actually from
(3:04:55) your worldview wrong with going on YouTube and saying 10,000 times the n-word with a hard R what is actually
(3:05:02) wrong with that in my view no no no from her view I again I don't see anything
(3:05:07) hang on let her let her answer let her answer i don't even like necessarily have like a problem with that like I
(3:05:13) really I don't say it but Yeah you're talking about free speech but you can't
(3:05:19) say it but you can't say it right but like what what about that is so truth
(3:05:24) liberating well it's not it's not a matter of truth liberating it's just a matter of testing the logical
(3:05:30) consistency when we're talking about truth I'm saying the truth doesn't rise to the top but if you're talking about
(3:05:37) the n-word with the hard R for instance you say I have no problem if somebody says it right why why don't you have a
(3:05:45) problem with that i mean it like bothers me on a personal level but do I think we should be like stopping like like
(3:05:52) arresting people or or like uh Well I think that [ __ ] should be out in the open so we can you know know who people
(3:05:59) actually are so why do you think So why do you think that that is suppressed
(3:06:07) um I guess because a bunch of people complained about because advertisers
(3:06:12) don't advertisers don't want their ads in front of content like that like just cuz it's truth like might be able to get like a truthful like uh videos getting
(3:06:20) uh deleted by terrorists like you probably don't want that on your YouTube platform because like it's going to scare off advertisers how are you not
(3:06:26) going to say kill but you're going to say the t word sorry I'm I'm swinging out the words
(3:06:32) well let me give you an example of how agreed i was going to add one more thing there because I'm curious Andrew do you
(3:06:38) think like should corporations be able like to kind of place what they want on their private platforms because I agree
(3:06:43) with your uh concerns but I don't how that interacts with the private private platforms there's nothing there's
(3:06:49) nothing we can do about this but if we're talking about how the truth rises to the top that I have an issue with let
(3:06:57) me give you a perfect example of how that's not true right now I do Tik Tok invasions all the
(3:07:05) time i go on Tik Tok i literally eviscerate progressive scumbags on Tik
(3:07:10) Tok all day long mhm if I say something this
(3:07:16) uncontroversial men with an XY chromosome who produce
(3:07:23) semen semen are not females i'll get banned
(3:07:32) is that suppression of truth sir that is suppression of truth let me ask him
(3:07:39) me um sorry i'm saying there let me repeat it i'll repeat i think you're saying on
(3:07:46) Tik Tok you can't say like on Tik Tok if I go on Tik Tok and I say a man a male
(3:07:53) who produces actual sperm has XY chromosomes is a
(3:07:59) male I'll get banned
(3:08:04) is that the truth rising to the top no but I don't think I don't think any of these platforms or algorithms are
(3:08:10) bringing the truth up to the top they're bring that that illustrates my point i agree the truth does not rise to the top
(3:08:17) is my point no no no my point was if you if you're allowed to have truth if
(3:08:22) you're allowed to if you have a lie and you're allowed to combat it with truth the truth will win you just gave a
(3:08:28) paradigm in which the truth is not allowed to be presented but the truth is not allowed to be s even if you allow
(3:08:35) both like stop like let's not [ __ ] the truth is not allowed to rise to the top
(3:08:42) right it's really not i see your point and where like there's a lot of these
(3:08:47) discussions that we're not allowed to have because there because one side is
(3:08:52) going to be like you're not allowed to have those discussions so I guess I'll concede it on that but like when a lot
(3:09:00) of people are talking about like these things like oh we can speak the truth on Twitter it's like most of them aren't
(3:09:06) actually talking about real [ __ ] they're just like saying that's okay nonsense
(3:09:12) what what is that wait wait wait wait wait what is that jump in here real quick i think it depends on why they're banning the thing cuz if they're if
(3:09:18) they're banning it to like stop misinformation that's one thing but if they're banning it because like oh they realize like hey advertisers not going to want to advertise on our platform if
(3:09:24) we like have debates about Transformers maybe let's just ban the topic all together transformers
(3:09:30) i I heard that's what Tik Tok is robots in disguise you know that right i'm on
(3:09:35) Sarah's channel so I'm trying to be Yeah but you do you do real realize the
(3:09:41) entailment there let me ask you just But wait just a second you you said you're okay with private platforms kind of
(3:09:47) dictating what they can and can't there's nothing you do about it but you do realize that Tik Tok is a Chinese
(3:09:52) company i do agree that's an issue that part of the tariff program and part of
(3:09:58) the Republican program was to stop hang on to stop Chinese propaganda from being
(3:10:04) able to infiltrate the United States and what what do you want to do do you
(3:10:11) think that it's okay to ban Tik Tok we should probably do something i don't I think the way it currently is
(3:10:17) run um in the current regulations they probably do new we probably need more how are you voting for Harris bro
(3:10:24) what are you doing what are you doing with your life stop voting for Harris look if you know that this is a
(3:10:30) disinformation company which is run by the Chinese and is designed specifically
(3:10:35) to run propaganda to demoralize the West and Republicans are telling you this is
(3:10:42) true and you know it's true why are you voting for [ __ ] Harris what are you doing wait but didn't we didn't we
(3:10:48) didn't we propose buying them under Biden's administrations like I don't know why this is like a left or right thing i think Democrats
(3:10:54) buying Do you want the United States to buy Tik Tok no America did make some
(3:11:00) kind of deal it would still be the same thing this is the same idea right you're missing my point i'm saying both
(3:11:05) Democrats and Republicans probably don't want the the Tik Tok issues they both parties agree yeah that Republicans
(3:11:12) don't want it democrats don't and here's why democrats are not in favor of like Chinese having a bunch of control via
(3:11:18) Tik Tok they're not for Well can you show me the Democratic proposal to stop
(3:11:23) Tik Tok in the United States go ahead got to look up because it's been a while but didn't something happen under Biden i'll look this up while uh go see yeah
(3:11:30) you look it up look up what Republicans said not not Democrats
(3:11:35) wait so you want freedom of truth or whatever but you want to ban Tik Tok
(3:11:43) that's not truth who would you like to be in charge of deciding what is true and not what is
(3:11:50) propaganda ghosty let's start with what is propaganda what is it propaganda is
(3:11:56) an intentional like force of information to uh persuade masses of people to think
(3:12:03) a certain way are you a propagandist uh no i don't What makes not What makes
(3:12:11) you not one um I'm not intentionally trying to make people think a certain way for a a like
(3:12:19) specific purpose especially maliciously let us assume for a second
(3:12:24) that you knew you were wrong but you'd make a lot of money by
(3:12:30) pushing a narrative which was incorrect you knew that yeah is there any penalty
(3:12:36) for you um other than defamation lawsuits no I
(3:12:43) don't think so there's nothing and so what happens if we allow foreign
(3:12:49) governments to move their social media platforms into the United States to to
(3:12:56) push a progressive message a progressive message which says
(3:13:03) um you know men can be women and women can be men
(3:13:08) well is demoralizing is that demoralizing to your enemy i mean that
(3:13:14) specific topic is like open to debate some you can Well then let's debate it
(3:13:20) can men be women can men be women are you propagandized you transgender people
(3:13:26) are you propagandized i will say transgender people exist yeah sure i would say the same thing but what
(3:13:33) we mean by transgender means what [Music]
(3:13:38) um uh somebody who has uh what is it body dysmorphia surgery
(3:13:46) okay so they're mentally ill
(3:13:52) and they um in order to be Are they mentally ill body dysmorphia is
(3:14:00) a mental illness yeah mhm so why is it that we're taking the word
(3:14:08) from a bunch of mentally ill people about what a woman and a man is ghosty
(3:14:14) just because we're not taking the word of them we're we're talking about professionals that work with them i think we're professionals but Ghosty
(3:14:20) just said that she doesn't believe in sociology remember
(3:14:25) maybe we disagree there ghosty go ahead remember Ghosty said she doesn't believe in sociology remember that just a few
(3:14:31) minutes ago I said it's not a real science oh it's not a real science and who says that men can be women
(3:14:38) psychology is I'm sorry psychology is sociology psychology is sociology
(3:14:44) no it's not oh go ahead and pull up sociology and
(3:14:50) psychology sociology and see what social sciences psychology is the study of Wait
(3:14:56) wait what is sociology what is sociology the difference is scale what is
(3:15:02) sociology the study of like social issues social sciences like social
(3:15:08) interactions and what is let me ask you let me ask you a question go ahead sure address that one go ahead i'm just
(3:15:14) curious like do you think no one is actually suffering from dysphoria no I think they are nothing i think they
(3:15:20) are i think I think that there are people who have a condition where they
(3:15:27) believe their limbs are causing them problems and want to cut them off would
(3:15:33) you say that they should if it if it gives them a better life outcome then yeah
(3:15:41) how how would you how are you measuring better if they if they feel better i just want to make sure I got this right
(3:15:47) your little brother comes to you and he's like "Hey my right arm i really hate this right arm i'm going to [ __ ]
(3:15:52) chop it off." Is it causing pain this doesn't Well sure it's causing mental
(3:15:58) anguish yeah that doesn't apply to No no that's a real [ __ ] condition i'm not
(3:16:03) kidding it's a real condition but wait it is the best solution wait is
(3:16:10) the best solution cutting their arm off because I think that's where a lot of people are saying the arm off yeah yeah
(3:16:16) yeah I don't know enough about that one then maybe if like if they're going to live in in anguish without doing that
(3:16:22) for the rest of their lives like maybe I don't know i just know I just know enough people now now if I cut my right
(3:16:28) arm off because it's causing me anguish am I
(3:16:34) now not a male your arm
(3:16:41) no that's not the same thing no okay so let me say my penis is causing me anguish and I cut that off am I now no
(3:16:48) longer a male muzzletoough that's definitely not a determining
(3:16:54) factor for me i'll say that yeah I would say so wait wait can I can I just ask
(3:16:59) you to answer me honestly if my arm was causing me anguish and I
(3:17:05) cut it off am I a male sir
(3:17:12) still oh uh uh yeah if I cut my penis
(3:17:18) off because it causes me anguish am I still a male i guess like
(3:17:25) biologically but you can No no no no not biologically am I still a [ __ ] male
(3:17:31) or not well it's a complex question right
(3:17:37) because how come I know you guys I'm still a male to dispute no because I
(3:17:44) know you like to dispute that like gender I guess like isn't a real thing or whatever what is What is it it's
(3:17:52) different than sex it's an expression of uh male and female I guess oh okay so if
(3:17:59) we look at both ends of gender if it's on a spectrum what are we pointing to
(3:18:06) both ends on a spectrum what are we pointing to so if a gender is a spectrum
(3:18:11) we have to have two points in which the spectrum points to what are both spectrums pointing to
(3:18:19) you mean male and female i'm asking you wait what that's a
(3:18:24) rainbow is a spectrum that doesn't mean like by default it's like it ends with red and ends with another color like no
(3:18:30) a rainbow is not that's not a good example i just silly there's literally it's literally a spectrum of light wait wait wait wait so the color red the
(3:18:37) color red is in a rainbow yeah yeah but you don't the customer either red or
(3:18:44) blue is a color red in a rainbow yes yes I agree with that is the color
(3:18:50) red in a spectrum then it's pointing to something which is
(3:18:56) within the spectrum of red so now let me ask you a question
(3:19:01) if you're saying that male female is just so you know it starts with red
(3:19:06) because that's like how our eyes were we happened to see red we could it's literally
(3:19:13) directly we could have evolved eyeballs that would started somewhere else and then would have pointed elsewhere so
(3:19:18) okay I don't think I don't think it's very accurate say it's pointed red what is gender what is gender sir
(3:19:25) what is you asking me now yeah well do I want to answer your question because once I brought up my thing you kind of didn't didn't because it's stupid and
(3:19:32) I'll explain why what is gender you brought Let him answer i'll go no I'm
(3:19:38) giving a very good response where you saying "Oh it's a spectrum therefore we had to like have this dichomy where I'm like "No it doesn't necessarily have to be that spectrums can be uh not it's not
(3:19:45) a zero or one kind of thing." Okay oh it's not okay well let's see let's see
(3:19:50) if we can't test this is red a thing yes
(3:19:55) great so then that means not red is the thing
(3:20:01) so then there must be a delineation point between when one color becomes red and when it's not red
(3:20:08) no there's no clear delineation so then how is red a thing
(3:20:15) is it something it's a part of the spectrum we identify and like we can identify as like a color that we there must be some delineation point between
(3:20:23) red and not red becomes red i guess like the saturation oh saturation okay great
(3:20:29) so wait you're b Wait you're I got to jump in here real quick you're basing off of human perception we happen to
(3:20:34) perceive colors different way other animals perceive it very differently so we're just going by what we have i think
(3:20:40) that's there's no there's no clear like oh red starts here and orange starts here it's more so we kind of identify
(3:20:46) like hey this part of the spectrum we kind of we want to wait i'm almost done to be practical we were
(3:20:53) like "Okay let's let's label this color this part of the spectrum this and we'll delineate it." But that's not how it actually works in reality it's a clear
(3:20:59) it's a a constant gradient there's no point where there's like definitively you're going from one color to the other
(3:21:04) we just divided that because it's easier for communication there either is a distinction a delineation or there's no
(3:21:10) distinction exactly there it's impossible what you're talking about is a contradiction is there the color red
(3:21:18) yes then the color then is there all colors which are not red
(3:21:26) yeah i agree i already say this delineation yeah but you know listen to me the delineation has to do with communication
(3:21:32) it makes it easier for us to say okay all these colors
(3:21:38) then red doesn't exist do you do you understand that there could be like a there could be like a
(3:21:44) spectrum or something that like where there's a constant gradient but also we might label parts of that to make it easier to identify sure i don't know
(3:21:51) let's do that that's all I've been saying let's do that and there's certain parts which are
(3:21:58) easier to identify than other parts would you say that a penis versus a vagina would be easier parts to identify
(3:22:05) than anything in between penis and vagina considering how many people penises and how many people have vaginas
(3:22:12) maybe for sex but not for gender I would think okay great so then what is gender
(3:22:20) i'm going to hop off to go see okay you hop off we'll let Sarah get
(3:22:26) back to her super chats oh go see Justin i'll give the same definition earlier where it's kind of
(3:22:32) like the colloial colloquially the things we associate with a certain sex so things you associate with being a male
(3:22:38) versus those things are not inherent wait I'm you ask me a question let me just answer i'm almost done but those things are not inherently uh involved
(3:22:45) like Yeah gen so he I just want to let you know what you just said gender is
(3:22:51) alluding to things that we consider to be associated with a what
(3:22:59) currently I'm saying the con the currently definition with sex but in a different society we might associate less with sex yeah okay so anyway when
(3:23:06) you what you just said was these words gender is a construct which we generally
(3:23:14) associate with what sex sex so then both points of the
(3:23:22) gender debate would be pointing at what just because society today like has this
(3:23:27) association accurate so both so both instances of gender would be Yeah that's
(3:23:32) the answer said that 10 minutes ago holy [ __ ] but that's literally the definition of But here's the thing right is that
(3:23:39) understand from my perspective you think you think Andrew Wilson bad faith try to put yourself in my shoes when I
(3:23:46) literally catwalk you to the [ __ ] answer and you still won't give it because you hate the fact that you
(3:23:53) answered all your question we've not gone to any of your questions for the past five minutes i've answered all of
(3:23:59) them okay okay so gender is pointing at Gender's pointing at what sir i said this is associated with sex i don't
(3:24:04) disagree it's associated with sex so if both spectrums are associated with sex what there really is is sex and what the
(3:24:10) social construct is is [ __ ] gender yeah i like to add this caveat currently in today's society because it's changed
(3:24:16) like we had different ideas of gender in the past it'll probably change in the future though there's no reason it had be has to be the same it is today
(3:24:21) currently today's society yes it is associated with sex but it doesn't have to be associated with sex so what is
(3:24:27) real is sex and what is a social construction is gender correct
(3:24:33) i think I Okay great once it stops being associated with sex it's no longer gender
(3:24:40) so it's no longer gender trait once it stops being sex associated but like what is your your argument is that my
(3:24:46) argument is simple my argument is is that sex is a biological reality and
(3:24:52) that the associatives that you put on this spectrum are actually just indicating sex and so if we know what is
(3:25:00) true what is true is that we all have a sex what is not true is that we all have a gender then what you're pointing at is
(3:25:07) the thing which is real that you're trying to be even if it's not real for instance let's just take an elf what is
(3:25:15) the characteristics of an elf from Lord of the Rings 20 years okay I agree what
(3:25:21) else they live a really long time so if I were to say I live longer than
(3:25:28) average and I glue elf ears to my [ __ ] head am I an elf
(3:25:36) no but in a fancy environment you might there might be other species that also have pointed ears and it would be crazy
(3:25:41) wow all all people with pointy ears are there for What are the characteristics of elves that are different than those
(3:25:46) of other species with pointy ears not expert but you're not an expert
(3:25:54) right i'm just asking no I'm not a [ __ ] nerd i don't know about Lord I imagine are you actually an elf
(3:26:01) because the characteristics of elves you meet whatever those characteristics are are you actually that thing
(3:26:09) well I qualify as an elf because I'm really little but go ahead Prawn if you wanted to
(3:26:15) answer well I think you're kind of put and I don't know what ghosty he feels but I think you're kind of put putting some progressive box where to me there is a difference between like a
(3:26:20) biological uh sex and and gender so I do agree there's a difference there uh
(3:26:26) which one is real and one isn't right
(3:26:32) one has to do with with your perception both like how you're perceived by others in your own in your own perception and
(3:26:37) one one is not so which one which one is
(3:26:42) real I don't I don't believe in that dichotomy so so so you can't answer the
(3:26:48) question which one is real is sex real or is gender they're both real which one is entirely subjective which one is an
(3:26:55) objective reality which one is not sex sex thank you okay we can move it on
(3:27:03) thank you so sexist thank you thank you Andrew wait wait i'll I'll let you go
(3:27:08) see but wait I agree with you i just had a second go you don't [ __ ] agree with nothing all you do is offiscate and lie
(3:27:15) your ass off because you don't like the comments you said you're not freaking listening i literally said one is the
(3:27:21) perception of you both your internal and and other ones that would be subjective so I actually What are they pointing at
(3:27:26) what are they pointing at no wait forget I'm You're acting like subjective is a dunk i literally just said the same
(3:27:32) thing in different words a second ago so it's not like presenting like oh I [ __ ] dunked on you when you l said the same thing I said in different words
(3:27:37) we established there was no objective truth and now sex is
(3:27:43) I agree yeah okay well then well then we have nothing to argue one is one is perception and one is not is there sex
(3:27:50) and then what you do is you say gender the gender spectrum between sex deviates towards sex which means there's no
(3:27:56) middle there's no middle ground you're either that is based on today's society that is
(3:28:02) not inherently of a system it can change it's changed the past it's not inherently true okay fair enough if it's
(3:28:09) not inherently true is sex in other societies today there are like a third genders so like
(3:28:16) is sex objectively true and gender is not objectively true
(3:28:23) i think I agree with that okay well then there's nothing there's nothing more to argue about
(3:28:31) why reception would still be pointing at what is objectively true what makes this such a big like issue though that like
(3:28:39) what is it about the fact that transgender people exist makes them like
(3:28:45) not truth or transgender like what is your problem like what is your problem
(3:28:50) what is a transgender person let's start with that um somebody who has body dysmorphia
(3:29:00) and uh associates so they're under a delusion would you agree they're under a
(3:29:06) delusion then if they have body dysmorphia well if it's a it's a real condition so I agree it's a real
(3:29:13) condition would you agree that this condition indicates that there's a mental illness by your definition are
(3:29:19) you saying all mental illnesses are delusional it's a mental illness that needs treatment and in order to treat it
(3:29:26) agreed so it's a mental illness that needs treatment if I said that I was the queen of France why would I be wrong
(3:29:35) this isn't an equivalency it is an equivalency if I said I was the queen of France why would I be wrong
(3:29:44) be because you're not the queen of France okay with that I'm going to go
(3:29:50) take a leak i hope you really [ __ ] think about what just happened i hope you really think about what just
(3:29:57) happened there i got to take a leak sarah I'll let you go on with your um
(3:30:02) with your super chats thank you i hope you don't need any help in there uh
(3:30:08) Marathon Kev coming in with the big 20 says "Watching from a distance salute
(3:30:13) sister Sarah and my ninja Flo." What's up Marathon Kev we love
(3:30:19) having you here unknown known says "Thank you for being a great host as always from the Crucible chat thank
(3:30:24) you." Uh starving a I'm not reading yours number one I said it would would have been 20 and up um and then number
(3:30:32) two I can't read that super chat it was not very nicely worded and that that like that will trigger every to possible
(3:30:39) but thank you so kindly terry comes in with the big 20 he asked the question "How can gender be a spectrum if we have
(3:30:46) bisexuals?" Can I answer that sure everyone feels differently but uh bisexual is do what
(3:30:53) you're attracted to that's different than what your gender is those are not inherently linked that makes no sense that question
(3:31:00) because bisexual necessitates that there's two sexes and gender is and gender is a
(3:31:07) reference to sex that's a good point i think agree with that yeah yeah that is a good point
(3:31:15) and then Benedict comes in with another another big 10 says "What gender is your dog and how do you know?" Ask his
(3:31:22) kindergarten teacher so far there's no evidence the dogs had dysphoria if that
(3:31:27) was an issue we might want to address it i just want to say this like the the French thingies
(3:31:34) dysphoria implies this is a mental illness based on something not true i just want to let you know that the big
(3:31:40) difference between like this now with like the like you're the king of France the the thing is there's evidence that shows actually addressing your dysphoria
(3:31:48) and like kind of identifying as other sex actually alleviates your symptoms i don't think that would be the case for the scenario you know what I'll grant
(3:31:54) the argument if I'm the queen if I say I'm the queen of France then you're going to tell me that I am and treat me
(3:32:01) like I am right yeah but that probably wouldn't help you where it would help what if I could demonstrate what if I
(3:32:06) could demonstrate that it did it alleviated my symptoms to treat me like the Queen of France you had to roll out
(3:32:12) a red carpet every day throw roses at my feet and follow all of my commands would
(3:32:17) you do it if it helped we're not We're not asking people to do that much would you do it
(3:32:24) i see an opportunity here we're asking people to use the same like pronouns we're not asking people to roll out the red carpet for you would you do
(3:32:32) it no probably not i probably would not put on if it uh Yeah I'm not going to lie to
(3:32:39) you because it helps you all for that level of I'm not gonna lie
(3:32:46) to you [ __ ] you lie to you [ __ ] you that Queens of France exist nobody's
(3:32:54) going to [ __ ] lie to you to help you [ __ ] off [ __ ] [ __ ] off we're not going to lie to you to help you all
(3:33:00) you're saying is "Yeah I would have to lie to you to help you but it's so much of a lie that I just feel like I
(3:33:06) shouldn't do that but I feel like it's such a little lie that you should do that." Andrew [ __ ] you it's the same
(3:33:12) [ __ ] you're just asking me to lie to help them but you wouldn't lie to me to help me with whatever my [ __ ]
(3:33:19) condition [ __ ] off dude [ __ ] is your whole thing is your whole thing like oh
(3:33:25) uh a a transgender woman is not a a biological female is that your whole
(3:33:32) gotcha i mean that's objective we agree i I agree with that too there there's
(3:33:37) like no progressive we No you don't no you don't you're lying to me and here
(3:33:43) I'll demonstrate it very quickly is a trans woman a woman
(3:33:49) um I address they're a transgender woman yeah yeah is a trans woman a woman
(3:33:56) biological or you're talking with a gender is a trans woman a [ __ ] woman can you say yes or no i have to ask you
(3:34:03) a question i need more information so hang on so then what is a transw
(3:34:09) woman versus a woman then well Andrew just even earlier you agreed at least we feel that sex and gender are different
(3:34:14) so you should be agree those differences
(3:34:20) okay so I would say I would say that a a what you call a trans woman is a man
(3:34:27) dressing up like a woman and pretending to be a woman that's what I would say so you tell me then now that you know my
(3:34:33) position and I've unequivocally told you it what is a transwoman a transwoman is
(3:34:41) a biological male who has body dysmorphia who transitioned to present
(3:34:48) as a female in order to uh address their condition oh great are they females
(3:34:56) biologically no okay are they women uh yes i I will There we go there we go
(3:35:04) trans women so what is Okay what's the difference between women and trans women but I
(3:35:10) don't addressing trans women as women trans woman is actually a man
(3:35:16) do you understand how like at least based on our worldview like that can you let her answer white knight let her
(3:35:21) answer i I will I'm sure answer bro let her answer this is very important though
(3:35:27) we'll get to you we'll get to you Sim let her answer is a trans woman a woman
(3:35:38) they are a trans woman so what is a trans woman i already told you this
(3:35:44) we're just dressing up woman it's a man dressing up like a woman no they're not dressing up i mean that might be part of
(3:35:51) it but they have like I already explained this they're biological man so okay well
(3:35:57) let's start with this what is a woman again like that's a loaded question it's
(3:36:04) a loaded question what a woman is really you know you know what stop stop you
(3:36:11) said you said you said you jump in we'll get
(3:36:17) to stoping we'll get to you you can't stop we'll get
(3:36:26) to We'll get to you you're not going to forget your question just Just address
(3:36:32) shut up bro shut up it's one v one wait a second ghosty ghosty
(3:36:37) are you a woman yes what is that
(3:36:42) an adult female okay great and are trans women that
(3:36:50) uh no they're trans women okay thank you that's all we needed so it's a man got
(3:36:55) it but it's not a man i mean I identify as a woman are we the same
(3:37:02) literally just now I turned trans have you been Have you been diagnosed
(3:37:07) you just mentioned dysphoria as a big part of that so that's not a requirement i just don't think Did you not mention
(3:37:13) that i don't know i like I I know many people
(3:37:20) who are trans and it's like not and are they and are they women it's not this
(3:37:26) like la like I just want to be a man like I want to be a woman
(3:37:31) that you guys like kind of make it out are they women ghost whimsical are they like you Ghosty are they women
(3:37:39) they are trans women can I jump in
(3:37:45) even identifying for even Lots of people will give me [ __ ] for even just like making that differentiation but there is
(3:37:51) a difference especially as a feminist okay what's the difference
(3:37:57) like I've already linked it to 10 [ __ ] times you said you said you said
(3:38:02) I'm a category of this thing and I agreed with you you're a category of this thing and the thing that makes you
(3:38:07) this thing are these criteria and then I asked you you know what what is a man then well it's the criteria of these
(3:38:14) things well then all you're saying is that everything which is not ontologically you is a man
(3:38:22) no there's that's why that's why but you guys agree that trans men and women exist but you're not depends on what you
(3:38:30) mean by that you're trying to Andrew said earlier dysphoria exists that's a very strange exist crossdressing exists
(3:38:36) surgery exists i agree well hang on no no no i agree that men with mental illnesses exist and I agree that women
(3:38:43) with mental illnesses exist can you explain what a trans person is
(3:38:49) i literally said it 10 times yeah so it's a man with a mental illness a man
(3:38:54) or a woman with body dysmorphia yeah and body dysmorphia is what
(3:39:00) it is a mental ill this isn't I know i agree she exists mental
(3:39:06) illnesses it's simple it's so simple even a
(3:39:11) [ __ ] [ __ ] can get it it's so simple a literal second grader can understand
(3:39:17) these concept the only reason you double down on this because you don't want to hurt the feeling you don't want to hurt
(3:39:22) the feelings of the people liars having a different opinion conclusion no but you're that's the whole pro the problem
(3:39:28) is you're making it out like a a liar like it's like a liar it is a lie it is a lie yeah it's not true so then if
(3:39:36) somebody tells you something which is not true and they know it's not true then what is it wait but it's true
(3:39:42) andrew wait andrew did you Wait Andrew do you not agree earlier that gender is a spectrum you said this right you agree with me there you said based on your
(3:39:48) worldview if it is a spectrum it's still pointing to two things i don't even believe gender exists i don't think
(3:39:54) gender exists i don't even think it's a thing i think you just make this [ __ ] up so that you can try to say that oh
(3:40:01) there's social norms that are one of the things that here I can prove it sex is
(3:40:07) the only real thing gender is not a thing at all it's just imagination if a young male plays with dolls is he now a
(3:40:13) female no oh that's weird but what you consider
(3:40:21) the concept of gender if a young male plays with dolls right is he a female then
(3:40:30) wait what no no exactly i agree so in both I feel like we should define gender
(3:40:36) i'm trying to explain it to you we don't even need to defi we'll both agree on the definition gender would be
(3:40:43) the expectation of social norms based on a sex you would agree do you agree with
(3:40:49) me where like that's currently today where it doesn't doesn't have to be one to one with sex there's a we could change that world where it could be more
(3:40:57) correlated and less correlated to that even the name transgender implies I'll just left to right i can literally grant
(3:41:04) it you're going to lose the argument either way if a little boy who's playing with dolls doesn't make him less of a boy and if a little boy playing with
(3:41:10) dolls doesn't make him less of a girl then what makes him more of a boy or a girl
(3:41:17) we're talking about gender in particular i would say it's a again I don't like the dichotomy where it's not it's not a
(3:41:22) clear spectrum where Yeah yeah yeah it's not Wait answer i'm trying to answer a question you just asked a question can I
(3:41:28) [ __ ] address it as soon as I as soon as I respond to a question just trying to over talk me yeah very good faith so
(3:41:34) I'm trying to answer your question you just asked me yeah go ahead um yeah I think there'd be a better society where like I don't think we should have like
(3:41:39) this view of like oh men only have this these characteristics i think there should be a more open view of what a man is and I think if we kind of separate
(3:41:46) the difference between sex and gender we are able to do that where I agree with you we should not have that perception where like if a if a young kid plays
(3:41:53) with dolls he's uh associated with a certain gender i want to I want to wait i want to divorce that connection go
(3:41:58) ahead what makes him a woman are you making the argument that we can uh help
(3:42:04) better help uh trans body dysmorphia by not accepting
(3:42:10) uh their transition i would make that argument what
(3:42:16) he wasn't but I would make that first of all first of all there's no transition you don't move from one thing to another
(3:42:22) thing you are By the way that would literally stop that would void the
(3:42:28) concept you're not actually that would void the concept of identity that would void the concept of identity you can
(3:42:34) only be ontologically what you are if you could ever be something other than what you are then that would violate the
(3:42:40) law of identity it's illogical you are what you are that is the second rule of
(3:42:46) logic the law of identity okay i think we're like I agree you should go to more
(3:42:52) like a more Go ahead sorry so do you think to help trans people you to better
(3:42:58) help trans people you would rather just deny uh their desire to transition you mean
(3:43:05) like we do with be accepted as the opposite sex like with schizophrenics we
(3:43:10) deny their voices yeah of course we're going to we're going to tell people the truth yeah you think that would that would help
(3:43:16) them because I don't think the medical field agrees with you it's not just about helping them it's about helping
(3:43:22) all medical industry wait it's about helping all of the public why
(3:43:27) go here shut up [ __ ] let me make you ask
(3:43:32) question how does this chick ask me a question and you instantly cut in shut the [ __ ] up so back to the bandwidth i
(3:43:39) don't even know this back to you Ghosty well okay so I'll tell you what you do this every time she asks me a question
(3:43:45) you go ahead and cut in every time okay i'll Every single time go ahead ask me whatever question you
(3:43:51) wanted to ask me so that I can never answer the one she just asked me
(3:43:57) you're I'll give it I'll give I'll give [ __ ] second i'll jump in right after that right after that so back back to where
(3:44:03) we were at go I thought [ __ ] asked a question are you going to and I'm trying to answer it you have to you have to
(3:44:09) stop talking though bro or I can't answer it how can I answer a question if you keep talking
(3:44:14) [Music] okay great so anyway Ghosty back to your question your question was should we
(3:44:20) affirm it uh so to answer this question let us assume for a moment and this is
(3:44:26) true that there are millions of people who do not want to affirm this because it does them harm if that is the case
(3:44:32) that it does you harm to affirm this thing in other words it's against some type of religious value or something
(3:44:38) like this why is it that all those people should affirm it anyway
(3:44:43) um if it's against your religious values um
(3:44:50) I got Okay so I'm not going to force you
(3:44:56) to Oh accept that I guess um I don't understand how it's harming you
(3:45:02) specifically but like you because we're not telling the truth well speaking of
(3:45:08) ask I'm going to ask my question now because I think Anna's going to go off another question since I tangent so I'm just curious i was answering the
(3:45:13) question i was literally answering question hold on hold on Prawn i know
(3:45:19) you're excited just boy you're you're you're really spurring when I'm trying to answer the question so if you're a
(3:45:24) Christian right you would agree with me that the value of lying is no good right
(3:45:29) we we're not allowed to lie so if you tell us that we must lie in order to affirm an untruth doesn't that do us
(3:45:36) harm um I guess from your perspective ah well
(3:45:44) that's why so it's just a disagreement based on
(3:45:50) belief values or based on belief values you and I agree this is not a woman this
(3:45:55) is not a man i got to ask my question at some point the distinction the distin It's really good to you we'll get to you
(3:46:02) we'll get to you we're almost done no I don't I don't believe you here's the distinction here's the distinction the distinction is Ghosty is that you're the
(3:46:10) ones asking us to lie um I guess I was just I was
(3:46:18) asking I was asking the harm and I guess if you're harm is that you
(3:46:25) uh can't understand the concept or or don't concept of it and and you consider
(3:46:33) that a lie to your religion then I'm not religious and it's a lie but in order to
(3:46:40) make other people Why are you going to put that on other people though
(3:46:45) you don't have to you don't have to accept it i can actually explain this very quickly if I could for some reason
(3:46:52) show you and demonstrate to you that if everybody believed in Christianity the world would be a better place would you
(3:46:59) then advocate that all people believed in it if you could actually do that success if
(3:47:05) I could actually demonstrate that it in some way improved the world if everybody
(3:47:11) believed in Christianity even though we knew Christianity was a lie would you then advocate we all believed in
(3:47:17) Christianity me personally no okay well then shut the
(3:47:23) [ __ ] up anyway so back to you sir for your question i'm curious i'm curious
(3:47:28) now about this because uh you know let me get in front of pro on this one i'll be real quick it's going to be real
(3:47:34) quick it's going to be a question go ahead so I'm curious is at least based on my knowledge the research shows like
(3:47:40) addressing uh addressing their trans their uh this dysphoria does like kind of make them less deletion i'm curious
(3:47:48) like if you don't like that solution what do you think is the best solution to address at least if you call it mental illness what do you think is the best solution to address their mental
(3:47:53) illness very simple i I think for instance that if everybody was a
(3:47:59) Christian that they would be less deletionprone therefore should everybody be Christian
(3:48:06) i don't I don't think I don't believe that be true why would not Christians delete themselves less than secularist
(3:48:15) that isn't true look it up i'll wait what about I'll just take your word I'll take your word for it so since that is
(3:48:20) true should we advocate everybody be Christian wait you didn't really answer my question though because I'm asking what is what do you think is the best
(3:48:25) solution it's a logical inter no but no you're trying you're trying to not answer my question by asking me a question i'm asking you what do you
(3:48:32) think is the best way to address their dysphoria i'll answer your question if you immediately answer mine is that fair
(3:48:38) i I'm happy to yeah okay let me rephrase it one more time though because again I I'll admit I could be wrong here i'm not an expert on the subject but research
(3:48:44) seems to show that addressing this dysphoria kind like working with it has good outcomes you don't seem to like
(3:48:50) that for the people with dysphoria for the people with dysphoria yeah I'll say that okay i would I would tend to even
(3:48:56) agree that that might be true you don't seem like there was your I Wait that was not my question
(3:49:03) that was a deal we made a deal that was not my question though that was actually I said it before your second question
(3:49:09) now this time when I answer your second question we must answer mine answer okay stop you've been taking up way more than
(3:49:15) a space stop acting so like angry jump in the
(3:49:22) fine how much time do you think you you've been This is how you got your air time back man you should have done this
(3:49:27) all along just want to make sure that we're clear like you're like "Oh my god this guy wants to This guy wants to enter the panel how dare you try to
(3:49:34) enter the conversation you've been taking way more of this time the airspace just let me jump in
(3:49:39) process to be fair should I ask your question i just want to make sure that after you ask
(3:49:45) your second one you will actually uh process just to be fair because flow
(3:49:52) state didn't do a whole lot of talking time i usually divide the time by the sides just like the last debate Andrew
(3:49:58) was on Torcha did very very very little talking so therefore Andrew had more floor space so I divide it that way and
(3:50:05) I look at it in that direction so if you and Ghosty are both doing a lot of talking I let it go both ways but but
(3:50:12) for Andrew's side if Flo is staying more quiet I just let him have the mic to himself so fair enough fair enough i do
(3:50:18) understand that i do got to say question but I promise yeah I promise i promise
(3:50:25) i'm a good I'm a good answer your second one clear my question is oh that was a preface my question is you don't seem to
(3:50:31) like the solution what would you do to address their dysphoria that's different than what we're doing today tell them the truth and if they selfdeleted that's
(3:50:37) still better for the public okay yeah at least you bite the bit the bullet okay what's your question for me there's no bullet to bite because I'm just going to
(3:50:44) ask you the second question back and you're going to agree if it were true that less people would selfdee if you
(3:50:50) can convince them of the delusion of Christianity would you then do so
(3:50:57) doesn't that be the case but I'd be literally answered your question yes or no can you answer mine please yes I'll
(3:51:04) say that you would you would you would convince them to be Christians
(3:51:09) i don't believe that's the case but if that if that was the case we're definitively Okay so I'm going to demonstrate to you that Christians
(3:51:16) delete themselves lesser than secularist and since that is the case you are now going to convince people that they
(3:51:22) You're missing You're missing You're missing question can I ask my question before you answer i I already answered a
(3:51:28) question do you You're asking a second question now yes wait you said one question i already answered it so now you made a deal we made Wait wait wait i
(3:51:35) gave you guys a note now I want to expand upon my answer can I do that before you ask your second question go ahead you're not going to ever be able
(3:51:40) to evade though but go ahead i won't evade i'll ask your question i'm not hiding i just want to give just want to
(3:51:46) let you know i just want to expand on my answer before I go into into the next question fair enough i think it's I
(3:51:52) think it's safe go ahead i'm on kind of off track but uh
(3:51:57) I think the difference is [ __ ] just ask that question i [ __ ] lost god damn it i need better now you question you were
(3:52:04) gonna ask okay okay well then I guess you have to answer mine so if I can demonstrate this for you right this second that secularists delete
(3:52:11) themselves at a higher rate than Christians you are going to forever more advocate that people be Christians yeah
(3:52:18) I was like yes with the caveat I was going to say and keep in mind part of the reason that probably uh people what
(3:52:24) uh the transformers are deleting themselves more often is because we live in a society where they are not viewed as they want to be viewed where maybe if
(3:52:30) they're perceived differently which again might be impacted by having a more secular society i bet they would end up
(3:52:36) deleting themselves a lot less so I want to give that caveat but you can't prove that right
(3:52:41) no I think that we have research to say say can you empirically prove it
(3:52:47) looking to data but just uh just based on how the best approach we have today for adjusting transphobia trans uh sorry
(3:52:53) not transphobia adjusting dysphoria is kind of like making them more more similar to what they feel inside that
(3:52:59) makes me think that's that's probably the best solution we have right now okay great but can you empirically prove
(3:53:06) empirically prove like here I'll give you an example
(3:53:11) uh do you believe that right now there are just as many uh young people per
(3:53:17) capita who are transgender as there were in the 1920s
(3:53:23) per capita there's probably more there's probably more right yeah I'd imagine why would there be more i was going to say
(3:53:28) probably the same why would there be more sir what do you mean like actually
(3:53:34) experiencing it or identifying it yeah per capita are there as many people with
(3:53:39) gender dysmorphia now as there were in the 1920s i want to clarify diagnosed with
(3:53:45) definitely because we probably were not diagnosing anyone with that back i'm not asking diagnosed okay so just would have
(3:53:52) h would have had it i don't know i would have I any more
(3:53:57) what would be the contributing factor then if you're born with this for why it
(3:54:03) would be in the 1920s that you had it less than you have it now unless it was social conditioning
(3:54:11) well I'm not saying either way there were definitely trans people like all throughout yeah do you think that there were as many per capita as there are now
(3:54:22) um I I I don't see why there wouldn't be yeah that makes sense there should be if
(3:54:28) they're born that way right right i think it'd be the same if you mean going on ghost fish with people that uh people
(3:54:34) that suffer dysphoria i think it'd be the same number if you compare it back maybe not diagnosed cuz back then we probably weren't looking it right
(3:54:41) identify so can you tell me something if affirmation is how you stop them from killing themselves then how come there
(3:54:47) was way less suicides in the 20s amongst the same peer groups that there's way more suicides in right now with trans
(3:54:56) i bet at least one factor is like there's probably more guns available so it's a little bit easier to There was more guns available in the 20s way more
(3:55:03) there wasn't even a background check system that's how you got food so can you explain this to me how it could be
(3:55:11) this many people had gender dysphoria the same amount as right now and yet the suicide rates per capita for the same
(3:55:17) groups were way lower when nobody affirmed it
(3:55:24) it's a good question i got I got to look more into it though yeah it's a good question cuz you're [ __ ] dumb you
(3:55:29) never think about nothing and all of you should be ashamed of yourselves ready for the next super chat
(3:55:35) praise baby Jesus um I've got one that came in on the uh Buy Me a Coffee app uh
(3:55:41) the legendary Trash Panda uh came in with the Big 25 says Andrew take it easy
(3:55:47) on us racco uh TF also take another shot i doubt you
(3:55:52) could handle it also what Zen flavor are you on uh well right now I'm um It's these like
(3:56:00) lime things citrus citrus oh yeah i'm about to pop another Z's in
(3:56:07) about to pop another one fair enough i had to I had to look this up i'm looking this up there's way more There's way
(3:56:14) more guns now than the 1920s i know what you guys talking about people to buy no you had a background
(3:56:20) check you have a background check system which was implemented by the Brady Act you had the uh assault weapons ban
(3:56:27) you've had every amount of gun control in the 1920s you could have a Thompson submachine gun shipped to your front
(3:56:33) door would you say that people today are heartier or or more sensitive
(3:56:42) uh I don't know you don't think You don't think people today are like you know little soy boy snowflakes and [ __ ]
(3:56:49) like that more than in the 19 [ __ ] 20s i'm not sure how I would quantify that
(3:56:56) but let us assume for a moment that yeah they're more soy boy now because you affirm their delusions and so they kill
(3:57:02) themselves more we probably shouldn't do that right i don't know if it has to do with
(3:57:08) affirming their delusions i'm just Oh I don't know i don't know the local has to
(3:57:13) do with like you guys had to make at least at least total guns there was definitely way less in 1920 than now
(3:57:19) yeah capital argument there was less people in 1920 than now yeah yeah but that doesn't make guns less available
(3:57:25) that makes guns more available even though there's more people around available so that's help me out here
(3:57:31) what do you think the population 1920 i should clarify cuz you guys were saying Okay okay great what do you think i'll
(3:57:37) agree we can move we can move on what do you think that the population of 1920 was versus now wait way way smaller i
(3:57:43) totally agree population has exploded since then that would impact 1920 was it was it about half
(3:57:51) the problem is you guys said total you didn't say per capita you guys should have specified per capita i would agree with you oh okay yeah you agree with
(3:57:58) Okay even though I did say pera but okay you did not let's go rewind it you did not say that you can rewind it and I
(3:58:04) just told you that guns were much more readily available in the 1920s than they are now way more available you go to
(3:58:10) your local hardware store and buy a machine gun a machine gun do you not
(3:58:15) think you don't think we produced we produce and sell more guns in total in America now compared to 1920 yeah
(3:58:21) because people own 15 but almost everybody had a gun in in America in the 1920s it was very common okay it's fine
(3:58:28) you can you can walk back your argument but I'm saying there's nothing total total amount of guns there's way there's
(3:58:33) way more now than people there's more guns no one's disputing that it has nothing to do with the suicion rate
(3:58:40) though yeah let me ask you a question let me ask you this let us assume for a moment that we had assume for a moment sir that we had
(3:58:48) a country where you had 330 million people and only half of them were armed versus a country where you had 100
(3:58:54) million people and twothirds of them were armed which country would have more access to guns
(3:59:01) one more time i'm bad at math so you had 300 million people and and about half of
(3:59:06) them had guns versus you had 1 million people and twothirds of them had guns which country is wrong yeah I just I
(3:59:12) don't disagree i said per capita i agree with you yeah I think you idiot i'm making your own argument i said I
(3:59:20) perly total guns you're wrong sorry Andrew god this guy i'm gonna rip I'm
(3:59:26) gonna one out so that I have less of a good head of hair than I do think less
(3:59:32) people were probably less I think more people were less likely to commit suicide back in those days and uh people
(3:59:39) had like more family like on them they had the same amount of
(3:59:45) gender dysphoria why are they killing they killing themselves less why are they killing themselves less uh time
(3:59:52) like things were also harder back in the day and people probably killed themselves less people had uh you but
(3:59:57) nobody was affirming but nobody was affirming their gender why are they killing themselves when no one's affirming their gender that's where
(4:00:03) you're Well it's not just about killing yourself it's about just overall happiness like alcoholics are happier if
(4:00:09) you let them drink you sure so smokers in the long term are they really though
(4:00:15) in the short term i So I I'm I'm very confused i would
(4:00:20) think that the selfdeletion would be the ultimate form of not being [ __ ] happy
(4:00:26) and yet for some reason all the same people in the same age demographic in
(4:00:31) the 1920s were not self-deing themselves even though they had the same rates of gender dysphoria and they had no affirm
(4:00:38) and they had no affirmation for this that's super [ __ ] weird can you explain that to me because it was my
(4:00:45) assumption is that because it was a different time and you couldn't come out as trans or even gay so you probably
(4:00:52) were forced or like like uh highly uh
(4:00:57) pushed into some kind of family life so you had people depending on you uh a
(4:01:02) social social like uh so you're saying that the best thing that we can do is
(4:01:07) force them back in the closet and give them responsibilities i agree good idea great idea oh because that's not the
(4:01:14) solution really good recommendation Ghost i love you Ghosty you're right push it back in the closet give more
(4:01:19) responsibilities and then they won't have to worry about it great i support Ghosty's proposal i support it too flow
(4:01:25) State you are completely correct oh my god haha
(4:01:31) how about How about some like uh it's a little adjacent but like something like conversion therapy do you think it's effective or does it end most people
(4:01:38) more people like bleeding themselves in the long run i don't think I don't know i I didn't
(4:01:43) hear the question say it again something like conversion therapy do you think it's an effective measure or does it end
(4:01:49) up with like more people deleting themselves you mean towards religion toward uh trying to convert trying to
(4:01:55) convert gay people to not be gay anymore oh yeah no I think that that saves their lives yeah
(4:02:02) you be willing to back up the stats on that like you're okay with the sex rates sure what was the selfie you would agree
(4:02:09) with me right now that there was as many homosexuals in the 1920s as there are right now right
(4:02:15) again uh identify with or like actually uh being open about it they are there's
(4:02:21) as many homosexuals in the 1920s as there are right now right yes how come they're deleting themselves less in the
(4:02:26) 1920s than they are right now i don't know i I I imagine like
(4:02:32) deletions of ghost be the best answer ever cuz she said the key words i don't
(4:02:39) know well I think it's like many factors i imagine at least one factor would be
(4:02:44) something you probably agree with me where has become like more secular society you probably a bit more so
(4:02:50) secularism secularism is bad and leads to selfdeion i agree god damn it Bron says what the [ __ ] are you doing i agree
(4:02:57) secularism leads to selfdeion i agree you probably shouldn't do that then we should probably be reinforcing Christian
(4:03:02) ethics shouldn't we great idea but I bet the reason secular people
(4:03:08) aren't killing themselves let me address i bet gaslighting and brainwashing everyone idea like the hell exists it
(4:03:14) might prevent people from doing that that want to end up doing that yeah that might have an effect yeah I agree i
(4:03:20) agree we should force Christian ethics on people and they'll stop deleting themselves at the same rate they were deleting themselves even if they're
(4:03:25) homosexual or trans i totally agree that leads to the better outcomes i'm completely right both of you agreed with
(4:03:30) me i love doing this to you i'll do it to you all night i tried I tried to build a bridge and he
(4:03:37) even talks to me then so oops wrong do you want to read this one
(4:03:43) sarah do you want me to read this one i can read it uh Sarah could you ask Ron
(4:03:49) why are you gay in a Nigerian accent uh really like know the answer
(4:03:56) despite my name I'm a straight white sis male voting for Camala
(4:04:02) all right let's barrel through the chats Sarah because I have to go but I will say this to the Crucible can we make her
(4:04:07) read a bunch of super chats tonight can we make her read a bunch of super chats tonight before I go we've gotten off on
(4:04:13) like tangential arguments i've enjoyed it but uh let's spam Sarah with some super chats before I go this evening i'd
(4:04:20) appreciate it thank you so kindly um all right I'm just going to start them right up here gr Gracie comes in with a big 10
(4:04:27) said saying "Debating gender itself is pretty gay." Uh Trib One says "With the five
(4:04:34) it's objectively true that males exist it's also conceptually true that men and women don't act like a monolith monolith
(4:04:40) we are unique therefore gender exists." The Queen of France is a title it's just
(4:04:45) That makes no sense if we are all unique then how does gender exist gender would
(4:04:52) be pointing to something which is not unique that's so stupid but anyway that's okay
(4:05:00) um the Queen of France is a title just like gend gender not a gotcha from Andrew france is also a title it's also
(4:05:07) a piece of land that humans gave meaning yeah so it's not true got it and Chuck wants to know uh which one is doing the
(4:05:16) moderator surprised that didn't come up tonight thank you Chuck um awesome yeah
(4:05:21) yeah okay my chat would never forgive me i'm going to ask Sarah because he'll never forgive me if I don't and you don't have to answer but are you still
(4:05:27) with based Oracle no oh okay no not that's that's been a long time oh um is
(4:05:34) it because he was bald is it Andrew's fault hang on is it because he was bald Sarah is it because he was bald they
(4:05:40) want me They want to know okay look i'm not gonna lie i'm not going to lie i'm going to ask the question the hard
(4:05:46) questions i get asked the hard questions on your [ __ ] i'm gonna ask you is it because Is it because he was bald he's
(4:05:53) not bald he's kind of bald is it because he did streams with his shirt off is it
(4:05:58) because he did streams with his shirt off they want to know they want to know
(4:06:04) inquire the inquiring minds want to know sarah um just difference of opinion okay fair
(4:06:12) enough okay austin King because he was bald and and did
(4:06:17) shirtless bald shirt all right go ahead go ahead go ahead dodging questions just
(4:06:23) like Andrew O those are not personal questions that he's
(4:06:29) dodging um Austin comes in with a five if gender is a spectrum what are you transitioning to wouldn't you already be
(4:06:36) whatever gender you identify as good point robert says "Trump Vos 2028
(4:06:43) what's going to happen if Trump is 1488 vance can covert bosch can be Trump's
(4:06:49) 2028 running mate inauguration move to 21429 benedict says "How much mess is
(4:06:56) that guy smoking dude does that guy All right a boss Trump ticket would be
(4:07:01) that'd be interesting." Uh Benedict says "You started to say something about bourbon Sarah here's a 30 total in this
(4:07:08) price point might I suggest Buffalo Trace have a good night folks." And no matter what go vote excellent advice and
(4:07:15) an excellent choice hang on Sarah hang on woman bring me one more shot and then I can finally redeem myself go ahead
(4:07:22) Sarah here we go peer pressure i have to defend the chair uh
(4:07:28) the chair to transformer as a transformer it can't be a white knight
(4:07:34) maybe we should just call it a bumblebee to the progressive should
(4:07:41) prisons separate prisoners based on sex or gender that's a very thought proc
(4:07:48) if anybody wants to respond you're more than welcome to uh sex
(4:07:53) oh probably oh that's really weird why should Why should they do it based on
(4:08:00) sex that's so weird i'm not denying biology but I'm also not denying
(4:08:07) body dysmorphia and transgender people like I think there's a medium here let
(4:08:14) me Can I ask you this Goce just like a really super like important to me can I
(4:08:19) Can I ask both of you this question just super simple question right do you think
(4:08:24) that prisoners would be more likely to grape a man or I'm sorry a woman who
(4:08:30) claimed to be a man but still had a vagina versus a man who had a penis which one do you think they'd be more
(4:08:36) likely to grape the the one with the vagina oh the one
(4:08:43) with the vagina so it's like we're the indication of reality when it meets your [ __ ] delusion doesn't seem to matter
(4:08:48) anymore does it well speaking of it's almost like we shouldn't maybe maybe we shouldn't have a like a one or zero dichotomy maybe like have a have a
(4:08:55) spectrum of uh people we can divide people [ __ ] maybe doing one or the other isn't the best way maybe it's not
(4:09:02) the best way to go people don't really identify that dichotomy if you got a [ __ ] a prisoner wants to [ __ ] it over a
(4:09:07) dick how's that for a dichotomy you want to dispute that yeah we can just have a
(4:09:12) another topic where like we have another section where none of them know how to deal with that you know it would be that way how do they not all deal with that
(4:09:21) so you would separate oh yeah you would separate the sexes yeah I know i know i
(4:09:28) know and not and but not not into two c not into two categories more than just that and that would solve all the issues
(4:09:34) we run into today so good for you guys to finally have to confront your own
(4:09:40) cognitive dissonance and [ __ ] asinine nonsense cheers to both of you question
(4:09:45) this is actually a great example andrew agrees with me we shouldn't have it based on we shouldn't have a dichom where it's just like male and female
(4:09:51) there should be a more complex system where we divide criminals up into i totally agree wow we found a we found a bridge okay so uh but I'm sorry on the
(4:09:59) spectrum how many genders are there should we I'm going to go get a drink should we go ahead and divvy them all up
(4:10:06) based on the gender they identify as based on what has best results but go
(4:10:12) ahead go see i kind of disagree with you on just that point cuz it's just not the
(4:10:17) it was just it's just causing too much like chaos at that point yeah too much
(4:10:23) chaos it's almost like we can take two criteria it's also third category that'd be so hard
(4:10:31) there's such a small I'm sorry it's almost like we wouldn't need that many resources to address their issues because they're
(4:10:36) such a small population are you saying that if you you're saying that you would take transgender or put them in a third
(4:10:42) criteria and then put them all together i I'd probably do it more complicated than that but if you want to make a complicated solution that would be
(4:10:48) better than that'd be that'd be better than the one the two system we have today yeah
(4:10:54) when it comes to prison when it comes down to prison I'm not trying to like accommodate for criminals can I can I
(4:10:59) please can I Yeah well we're not trying to accommodate for you i just want to know how would you divide them up so I
(4:11:05) don't have I like I said I said this a second ago you probably listening I said I don't have a definitive system I would do whatever has the best idea okay so if
(4:11:11) people end up getting great less in a different system I'd be for that whatever that system is whatever the research says you don't know what the
(4:11:17) system is of course right you don't know either because you don't have a solution either you just
(4:11:23) hang all you did was point out the issues with the system we have today which I agree there are there are
(4:11:28) issues the only thing is I'd be open to a solution go ahead i'll give you my system i'm listening what you would do
(4:11:34) is you would divide up males with males and females with we have no we have no
(4:11:41) issues with essay in jail today that no issues at all hang on hang on nobody's disputing that there's not male on male
(4:11:48) grape or female on female grape what are is in dispute is whether or not if you have a vagina you'll get grape more the
(4:11:54) answer is yes so if that is the case then we will put the vaginas with the vaginas the penises with penises right
(4:11:59) dummy no how do you get How do you think um what's like the guy who's like uh
(4:12:05) he's not Blair right he's like the opposite where he he looks like a dude but he's like not a dude you know what
(4:12:10) I'm talking about ghosty [ __ ] name where he likes most people
(4:12:17) if you if he has 100 people like that's [ __ ] that's a dude but he has a vagina so if you wait if you put him in
(4:12:24) if you put him in a bunch of women how do you think that's going to go it's probably going to lead to Totally hang on but if you put if you put him in Hang
(4:12:30) on I'm going to totally concede to your argument i'm going to totally concede to your argument let us assume for a moment
(4:12:36) that Bunk Buck Angel if you send him to a cell full of women you're saying that
(4:12:44) Buck Angel's going to assault them more if you did it on math it probably wouldn't it probably would have results
(4:12:50) you're talking about similar to it probably wouldn't it probably would not alleviate all your issues you're addressing i'm saying for Buck Angel I
(4:12:56) don't know which one it would be safer so you're saying to go to You're saying that if you put a female with females
(4:13:01) the essay will be lower if you put males with males they have they're very dysphoric yeah there might be there
(4:13:06) might be males with males the essay will be lower but if you put the females with the males the essay will be higher and
(4:13:12) the males with females the essay will be higher i agree not I'm suggesting there's a possibility and I don't even
(4:13:17) know i'm I'm open to the research that if you had a third category of people that are dysphoric maybe they were separated on their own there might be
(4:13:22) better results if that was the case I'd be I'd be willing to put that forward is that that is that that ridiculous well
(4:13:29) it's actually illogical so let us let us assume we're gonna go ahead and make your prison all you're doing is mixing
(4:13:34) males and females yeah no I'm sorry if you had Buck Angel and
(4:13:40) Blair White right that would be F to M and M to F right there be different
(4:13:46) types of You're saying that the people with I'm answering your question can I ask the
(4:13:52) question before you answer it are you saying that the males wouldn't be more say the biological females so you're
(4:14:00) making assumption I and maybe I I [ __ ] up by saying putting dysphoria in a group two group but in my headed I'm
(4:14:05) saying I'm saying it I'm dividing into two groups because you dysphoria is going to uh express in two in two major
(4:14:11) ways where you feel like you're the opposite sex so usually it means you feel like a woman or a guy the two
(4:14:16) express so I would maybe I would probably play divide those different types of dysphoria so now wait I'm
(4:14:22) almost one more time and then probably address the concern you're bringing up go ahead okay so now you're going to divide all the F2MS and the M2Fs and
(4:14:29) they're going to be in their own social groups if they had better results I'd be for that yeah how frequently can they change
(4:14:36) their mind if they're just females and they're just males why would you assume that the grape rate would be any less
(4:14:41) than it would be amongst I don't know that's what I'm saying if it had better results I'd be for that i'm not saying
(4:14:46) either way what I'd be for i'm saying you assume what do you assume let me ask you a question if you have males who
(4:14:53) have x amount of stat rape on males and you have females who have x amount of stat rape on females why would you then
(4:15:01) assume that if you were to take the trans version of those things and put them all together that the rate would go
(4:15:07) down are you making an assumption like that people that are not actually dysphoric would enter is that your females are
(4:15:13) still females why would you then assume that the SA rate would go down even
(4:15:20) though they're the same sex that makes no sense i had to say this one more time i'm not making that assumption i'm saying if that was proven to be the case
(4:15:26) I'd be forward that system do you want what I'm asking you what do you think i don't know you We already said
(4:15:33) this it's good to answer i don't know we don't have the research but it's okay logically test it we're just going to
(4:15:39) logically test it 10 times that's crazy if you have females in a prison is there going to be grape
(4:15:47) okay if you have males in a prison is there going to be grape yes can you point to me the thing that if you have
(4:15:53) males and females in prison and there's going to be grape is going to reduce it simply because they identify as the
(4:16:00) opposite sex even though they're the same sex
(4:16:08) that's to me or either one wait wait wait sorry i It's
(4:16:14) confusing so you're saying by putting which which one are you asking for are you asking you to put Okay here
(4:16:21) I'm I'm going to make it super simple but pay attention to what I'm saying it's very important ghosty do you agree with me
(4:16:29) that males in male prison will grape each other
(4:16:34) do you agree that females in female prison will grape each other bless the males okay so if Okay
(4:16:42) fine do you agree then that if you had M2F transitioners and section them all
(4:16:49) off they're still males and will still grape each other
(4:16:55) oh you mean if trans people had their own prison yes oh I see yeah would not
(4:17:00) be a zero but because it would still be it would still just be males and females so I don't understand why somehow the
(4:17:07) grape goes down even though we're segregating by the same exact thing which is by sex except we're just making
(4:17:14) a new category by sex so now what you do is you take all the males who identify as females who are still males and put
(4:17:21) them all together and you take all the females who identify as males and put them all together why do you assume that
(4:17:27) the grape rates are going to go down that's my question
(4:17:33) yeah if you're in prison for life like people are probably gonna Yeah I know but can you answer my question can you
(4:17:39) answer my question sir I said I'm not making that assumption i said like five times i'm making that assumption cuz it's [ __ ] stupid it's stupid all
(4:17:46) right Sarah go ahead sarah the stupidest [ __ ] I've ever heard you actually dump
(4:17:51) but I said this from the very beginning where if the evidence showed that I before that I don't know how to say it sometimes if the evidence says
(4:17:57) something's going to be a positive I'm probably going to be for that system if you say the I'm not going to be until I don't get it
(4:18:04) you know what great great argument how would you gather this evidence absent the segregation to show the evidence and
(4:18:12) I'm just going to ask you if you're going to segregate why would you assume that male to male or female to female
(4:18:19) grape would somehow decrease just because they had transitioned and call themselves something else that's my
(4:18:25) [ __ ] question can he answer it well I'm not I'm not making assumptions
(4:18:31) so I don't know that but I'm saying I assume that if you what I am assuming if you miss if you mix uh sis people in
(4:18:38) dysphoria issue that might lead to some issues and concerns that's not my question what's my question can you repeat it back to me you had to repeat
(4:18:45) it but I'm telling you that's what I'm trying to know my question okay I'll repeat it it didn't make any sense to me
(4:18:51) to be honest i'll recreate I I'll repeat it this is [ __ ] in Okay I'll try again there's males there's females let
(4:18:59) us assume for a second that all the people who identified as being male
(4:19:05) male even though they were female they identified as being male got put in a
(4:19:11) block and all of the people identified as being female got put in a block right
(4:19:17) why would we assume that the amount of grape would decrease from those who did
(4:19:23) not identify as being those things
(4:19:29) i keep wrong but didn't you bring this up earlier where like there were issues where if you have someone who doesn't have the same genitalia as everyone else
(4:19:35) in the block they might have some issues is that not what you're talking about they're the same genitalia
(4:19:45) go see you're muted oh he was talking about making like a third and fourth prison for trans people sure sure but
(4:19:52) it's the same thing but it wouldn't protect you have a penis you identify as a female all of you go to the same block
(4:19:58) or you don't have a penis and you all identify as a male you go to the same block why suddenly do the grape rates go
(4:20:06) down can you explain that to me
(4:20:11) is that true i'm honest i'm asking you why do we assume the grape rates go down
(4:20:21) why you were trying to make a system like to protect them because it is kind of like
(4:20:28) difficult right like where where are they more safer to go into and that's why I just think like I don't know maybe
(4:20:35) it's a case by case basis but for me my personal advice to trans people is just like don't don't do crimes and go to
(4:20:42) prison because it's probably going to be extra dangerous oh great well my everybody is don't do crimes and go to
(4:20:47) prison i'm glad that we resolved that mhm do you think like in a male block if
(4:20:53) you're the if you're the only one who's like a sis male you might be like targeted or treated differently than the rest people in the block if you're the
(4:20:59) only sis male so if you're not sis male and everyone else is sis male oh yeah all the all the
(4:21:07) sort of gay straight guys are going to be coming for that they're going to go they're going to come [ __ ] you bro what do you mean like what are you talking
(4:21:13) about you're going to get a lot of honey i I agree with you there that's why we should probably separate them i don't
(4:21:19) That's Let's try Let's try it the opposite way then if you were to mix
(4:21:25) females females with males would the grape rate in prison go
(4:21:31) up or down it makes men and women is that what you're asking yes definitely would go up
(4:21:38) I'd imagine why cuz most people are heterosexual oh
(4:21:45) because they want to [ __ ] [ __ ] okay got it so Buck Angel if Buck Angel has a [ __ ] and you put Buck Angel in a prison
(4:21:53) block where he has a [ __ ] okay and these are people who are prone to grape
(4:21:59) is Buck Angel going to get grape more than the general population yes that's why I think Buck Angel from there that's
(4:22:06) the end of it that's the end of it yeah that's why I think Buck Angel would rather go in a a female prison probably
(4:22:13) and I would rather except for the same rates as every other female prisoner of
(4:22:19) the female respectfully the females probably don't want to be with Buck Angel also that's why they should probably also be like "Hey no Buck Angel
(4:22:25) probably on his own own space we're not comfortable having someone like this in our our block also." It's amazing how
(4:22:30) much mental work y'all are doing to try to make something that's not moving on i
(4:22:36) agree it's not like do you How do people I know uh in transform bathrooms like do you think Bucking Angel should be
(4:22:41) allowed in a female versus a male bathroom should go into a female the same to you i because he's not a he it's
(4:22:48) a she she should go into a female bathroom it's a man that has a surgical vagina right oh no it's a female that
(4:22:55) has this it's a woman let me ask you a question why don't we even Angelique
(4:23:00) bathrooms to begin with why not just make them all multisex i
(4:23:06) think we should just have single stall bathrooms to be honest so so wait a second you have no problem going into a
(4:23:13) bathroom where there's tons of men right ghosting i mean I go into the male bathroom when the line's too long but
(4:23:18) that's just me i'm not scared to be raped in a bathroom like I feel like that's Oh you're you're not you're not
(4:23:24) the best looking chick but let's assume there was a really good-looking chick if there was a really good-looking chick
(4:23:31) would you assume that she wants to go into a male bathroom i imagine most women would not be comfortable with that
(4:23:37) why why cuz it's dirty the main reason is because they're now let me ask him
(4:23:42) why women bathroom they feel they feel less safe yeah they feel less safe so let me ask you this uh if that is the
(4:23:49) case and they feel less safe why would they feel more safe with men coming into their bathroom i don't understand that
(4:23:55) so I think the average woman would be more would feel more safe with Blair White coming in versus Buck Angel even
(4:24:01) though maybe Blair White has male genitalia versus Yeah great great but let us assume for a second it's just a
(4:24:07) guy with a wig on who identifies as being female can he use that same bathroom
(4:24:12) well that's that's why I specified i think it depends on the exact case and scenario where we might would have a third category who makes the judgment
(4:24:17) who makes the judgment that's a good question i would uh I would kind of leave it up to the
(4:24:24) individual what's stopping men from entering a female's bathroom let him answer please let him answer who i would
(4:24:32) leave who gets left up to the judgment who a big a big factor honestly would be the the women's block and what they're
(4:24:37) comfortable having in their in their block because I think they're the most
(4:24:42) skeness comes in you're fine with that right no if they don't if they want if they want them to be up on their own i'm
(4:24:48) okay with that i said that earlier segregated bathrooms are fine you [ __ ] they're fine yeah yeah i'm okay
(4:24:55) with that yeah i'm okay with an individual individual stalls general neutral stalls i'm saying I think it's
(4:25:00) ridiculous to say like "Oh we had to allow Blair White in his bathroom but not not the other way around." There's a difference there what's the difference
(4:25:09) one one is way more intriguing to women in the women's restroom blair White say "I don't want anybody with a penis i
(4:25:17) don't want anybody with a penis or XY chromosomes in my bathroom." They say that again you miss my point i'm saying
(4:25:23) in in reality that if Blairweight walked in the room they would be more comfortable
(4:25:29) with that than if Buck Angel walked in let us assume you're even correct let us assume you're correct if women
(4:25:35) collectively say "I don't want any male in my bathroom." What's wrong with that
(4:25:42) so in this case you're saying we should ban Blair White and Buck Angel from I'm just going to ask you again i'm just going to ask you the question i had to
(4:25:48) clarify i brought up I'm bring up the say we don't want Anybody who was born a
(4:25:54) male in our What is the problem with that i had to ask questions we keep talking about sex
(4:26:00) and gender so are you saying in the scenario is Blair White or Buck Angel allowed in the woman's restroom no well
(4:26:07) I think Blair White would Blair White would not be Angel who is a female
(4:26:14) would be allowed yeah yeah i think I'd be against that why if if if women felt
(4:26:20) more safe without that I'd be for a woman with who had a [ __ ]
(4:26:26) if you're a woman he would be against aware of your surroundings at all time
(4:26:31) sign on the bathroom door isn't going to stop a man from coming in and raping you if you really want can I finish my
(4:26:36) argument such a [ __ ] conversation so let's say that the woman was super buff and she was on all sorts of testosterone
(4:26:44) and she was super strong are you saying that women would be against that
(4:26:49) yes so there there's difference there how much they're passing for this bathroom and that's how how s women feel
(4:26:54) yes no there's all sorts of buff women who use the women's bathroom nobody cares
(4:27:01) and there's a feminite men who use men's bathroom yeah but a buck woman and buck angel aren't the same thing yeah they're
(4:27:08) the same thing what it is is it's a woman who's taking chemicals to make themselves men are not bald they are
(4:27:15) male male pattern baldness no it's not the same bro do they have a [ __ ]
(4:27:22) yes I agree but I'm saying that's not Then I'm trying to address the women's
(4:27:28) fear in the bathroom yeah if you were to ask the woman individually would you prefer a person a person who looked like
(4:27:33) a man which many women look like men can came in here who had a [ __ ] would you
(4:27:39) prefer that women who had a [ __ ] came into the women's bathroom what do you think they'd say
(4:27:47) they probably not not okay with that if a buff wait sir say one more time sorry
(4:27:52) okay if you were to ask women there's plenty of buff women
(4:27:57) there's plenty of women who are on testosterone things like this would you prefer if everybody who came into your
(4:28:03) bathroom had an actual vagina they were born with what do you think they'd say
(4:28:10) to answer the question but are you incorporating dysphoria into that somewhere i think that's a factor no
(4:28:15) literally listen people can understand it i'll
(4:28:21) answer if you went to any random woman and said "Would you feel safer?" If the
(4:28:27) people who came into your bathroom were born with a vagina they have a
(4:28:34) vagina and that's what allows them to go into your bathroom what do you think
(4:28:39) they would say i imagine if you ask that on a poll they would say yes but maybe in reality their
(4:28:45) experience might be different okay great yes okay we can move on from there sarah it's almost like when you extract things
(4:28:51) you might have a different answer in reality this but one thing that nobody really did mention was children in these
(4:28:59) different bathrooms uh that we go into stores all the time and I'm very reluctant to allow my child to go into a
(4:29:05) bathroom on their own whether male or female because today's age is crazy and
(4:29:10) you just never know it drives me nuts um all right where I left off was Don Juan
(4:29:16) coming in with the Big 10 he says "Left but was informed that Andrew responded to me." Funny how Ireland had its first
(4:29:22) Eastern uh parish in the 1960s but you can be the 2% of OrthoIrish councils of
(4:29:30) Lion and Florence the East left yeah well Don Juan Plague is zero did it
(4:29:35) start as an Orthodox or as a Catholic nation that's my question i've asked it
(4:29:41) multiple times you seem to refuse to answer but anyway go ahead Sarah that's
(4:29:46) fair um all the others were taken i like that name comes in with the big 20 will
(4:29:51) someone ask the people what is the difference between gender and personality and I feel question what is
(4:29:56) the difference but okay I fair enough go through No go through your super chat Sarah i I I do have to go here uh
(4:30:05) because I do have a stream in the morning go through your super chats we've been arguing non-stop we've been arguing non-stop i'm okay with it you're
(4:30:12) not holding me back on anything so that's fair if you wanted to address the question you were more than wise you got to go through the super chats or else
(4:30:19) they'll they'll revolt sarah go revolt oh no join comes in with the big 10 easy
(4:30:26) question prawn oh god if a guy blowing if a guy blowing a guy is gah is blowing

(4:38:20) King coming in with a big 20 if you agree that body dis dysphoria is a mental illness why would affirming this
(4:38:28) as true be helpful imagine telling someone schizophrenia the voices they hear are real is that helpful are all
(4:38:35) mental illnesses the same no do they all have the same treatments no nope cool
(4:38:41) this is the only one where the treatment is to deny reality and affirm the delusion hey you know what you're right
(4:38:47) Ghosty i just want to ask you a single question are Christians delusional
(4:38:55) uh depends who you ask I guess are Christians delusional i'm asking you
(4:39:00) um some of them delusional is kind of a loaded word yeah so I'm just asking are
(4:39:08) Christians delusional some of them yeah should you affirm that
(4:39:15) uh I'm not going to tell them what to believe because I don't think anybody knows what God actually is should you affirm it
(4:39:22) should you never speak out against it and say anything about it because you need to affirm it because it makes them
(4:39:28) feel better well I don't have proof that they're wrong that's what she's doing so Oh okay okay so then you should affirm
(4:39:34) it the difference is with schizophrenia telling them what to believe there's not good The difference is with
(4:39:40) schizophrenia there's no good results for like enabling their behavior whereas the only cutting off is a bad result mr
(4:39:47) i'll be done yeah I agree if you if you use it if you enable schizophrenia there's a bad result if you cutting your
(4:39:52) dick off is a bad result yeah I'm not even for that all the time most even people don't agree this the best solution for every everything
(4:39:59) but hey I am okay with what the professionals are addressing that has the best results so do you have any
(4:40:05) opinions that contradict a professional opinion or an expert's opinion what is
(4:40:10) something that you know to be so true that an expert could disagree with you and you would not be swayed
(4:40:17) if the expert is the expert uh opinions plus the actual results where it seems like uh you haven't looked at you have
(4:40:23) not looked at studies on all this [ __ ] you take I'm just going to I'm going to private assume you have shrooms are the
(4:40:30) best i'm going to assume you have the process i'm just going to ask you the same question is Christianity a delusion
(4:40:36) i think depends on how someone's getting there i'm asking you i think yes in uh some cases okay great
(4:40:43) so did you affirm it again no cuz I don't think that Shut the [ __ ] up dude anyway my point chat wait
(4:40:51) I'm going to just real quick I'm done thing is affirming it has different results whereas this seems to be the
(4:40:56) difference affirming this has the best results in that it ends with the most with uh I just thinking they're
(4:41:03) deletions I'll say that where is the result what is the result of affirming Christianity
(4:41:11) one more time what is the result of affirming Christianity there's a lot of different results yeah logical results
(4:41:17) we don't know I'm Do you think that Christians are more or less likely to delete themselves if you affirm or do
(4:41:22) not affirm their religion i'm assuming you say uh it's true again
(4:41:28) not against affirming some people's religion if you don't so are do you think that Christianity is a delusion
(4:41:38) yes should you affirm it it depends on how what results you're
(4:41:44) going it led to less selfdeion should you affirm it yeah if that's your goal if you want to
(4:41:51) make it lead to less selfdeion if you affirmed it for Christians probably yeah
(4:41:57) well then you should what affirm Christianity right yeah christians can go I'm your Christian overlord shut your
(4:42:05) [ __ ] mouth and become a Christian now right this second [ __ ] because that's what we demand or else you're not
(4:42:11) affirming our delusion what you miss here is there's no there's no research saying if you're an atheist suddenly becoming a Christian is going
(4:42:17) to make you like suddenly happy and not delete yourself if you legitely believe like the Christian like uh writings and
(4:42:23) like doctrine that might make you happier overall but I feel like that's not what I asked that's not what I asked you well no you gutless piece of [ __ ] i
(4:42:31) asked you if you said if you're Christian yes that will probably be the biggest like sack of [ __ ] on planet
(4:42:36) earth so we'll do it again we're going to do it again we're going to do it again
(4:42:46) d hang on Sarah hang on Sarah sarah you got it hang on Sarah you got it now do
(4:42:52) Hang on hang on nobody say a word now do Indiana Jones that is Indiana Jones
(4:42:59) now do Star Wars now do Star Wars now hang on now Sarah do Back to the
(4:43:06) Future oh [ __ ] uh wait
(4:43:13) i think it's not fair i think it's I think it's cheating i think it's cheat It's cheating jesus we found
(4:43:20) her it's cheating you're [ __ ] cheating but anyway all right all right
(4:43:26) fine fine you cut in we got to We have to keep it rolling but the thing is is like uh clearly I demonstrated that if
(4:43:33) it's a delusion you believe it's a delusion you won't affirm it in some cases because you think the result is worse that's exactly what Christians
(4:43:38) think back you have no argument to this you're [ __ ] dumb but anyway I like
(4:43:44) I think this is the difference i think the main difference is like most people like secular people well I mean maybe
(4:43:50) not most but for me personally I'm fine with Shut up chat she's cheating she's cheating i'm fine with Christians
(4:43:55) believing in whatever they want to believe in God cuz I don't think anybody can affirm or or deny No no no that's
(4:44:02) not the question give me another one give me another one that's literally not the question you mention is that I'm
(4:44:08) against I don't think that's the case i'm not against that if not affirming Christianity and not affirming what
(4:44:15) Christians believe led to more selfdeions would you affirm what they believe that's my question
(4:44:23) if Oh god my brain let's try it again ghosty here you go ready sorry if you
(4:44:29) think Christian Christianity is a delusion and not affirming what they
(4:44:34) believe leads to more selfdeions would you affirm what they believe
(4:44:39) so not affirming what they believe leads to more selfdeions would I affirm it even if I
(4:44:46) think it's a delusion yes okay no no okay then we can move on from there
(4:44:56) we nailed it we ended all the debates we got a final a final answer i mean if
(4:45:01) somebody was going to like straight up kill themselves to my face though and I was like God's I had I don't know i
(4:45:08) guess I guess like I see your point but I don't know i feel like it's just
(4:45:14) the same point it's just the same point in reverse that's why liberals liberals have so much trouble with this because
(4:45:19) it's the same point you're making just back to you and you say "I'm not going to affirm i'm not going to for mental
(4:45:27) illness and I'm not going to affirm delusion but when we say the same thing that's bad and that's why I think that
(4:45:33) liberals are [ __ ] stupid i had to say me and Ghost are not against affirming uh religious views we're fine with that
(4:45:39) of existing society you're against us affirming trans people views that's the difference here i'm okay with you going
(4:45:45) to church and read and reading your Bible and you can do that all day long i don't give a [ __ ] tell me then tell me
(4:45:50) tell me Jesus Christ is God right now do it like I said for Christians I'm an
(4:45:57) atheist yeah I'm a Christian i want you to affirm what you consider a delusion tell me Jesus Christ is God tell me
(4:46:04) Jesus Christ is God right now you want to risk it are you willing to have that blood on me tell me Jesus Christ is God right now sir you're missing it cuz
(4:46:10) maybe maybe are you going to tell me i'm sorry if you don't uphold my delusion I might do all sorts of bad things can you
(4:46:17) please tell me Jesus Christ is God the difference is you making me You're making
(4:46:22) me address that i I'm making you what lie not tell the truth
(4:46:28) you [ __ ] idiot every time you don't tell him that God kills a kitten
(4:46:36) what the [ __ ]
(4:46:41) leave alone all right all right
(4:46:48) um I don't even know uh Altervoid says "Don't worry we are not a cult you can
(4:46:53) join us we are just the chat." They are just the chat and we don't have a cult over here on the Crucible except for the
(4:47:01) cult of good entertainment that is what we do have over here for the best entertainment we do have a cult around
(4:47:07) that because we have a cult of wanting to be entertained and we appreciate you guys sending in those big super chats
(4:47:15) especially to our supporters and Alex Jones with the five said "Thanks Andrew." Courtesy of the
(4:47:22) Crucible crew by the way Princess needs to bite the bullet and come out it's Oh
(4:47:27) come on be nice looking good thank you i can handle it but yeah a lot of projection coming from chat i understand
(4:47:32) i mean my name is the princess i'm kind of asking for it and Econ comes in with the big 20 he
(4:47:39) says "Telling kids that Santa exists and they stop being bad to get presents doesn't prove Santa exists but it does
(4:47:45) prove that Santa can be used to help children behave." Agreed
(4:47:52) which is why I tell my children there's no fat buck who comes down the chimney every year to give you presents it is
(4:48:01) your parents who get all of the credit and I eat the cookies at night because
(4:48:06) it gives me energy to make little sisters and brothers for you that's That's I love hearing that Christmas
(4:48:12) story anyway go ahead uh anybody know the Superman theme
(4:48:21) no I don't remember that one either which one there's probably I know there's like a lot probably like the
(4:48:27) original original one but what about Rocco's Modern Life wait a second you don't know Superman
(4:48:34) you don't know that's Batman yeah Batman
(4:48:41) don Juan says Catholic that's it on my end um and I can go
(4:48:46) through and read the song when you guys all roll out um
(4:48:52) holy [ __ ] you guys certainly had a lot to duke out this evening um and I hope
(4:48:58) everybody had fun doing so has anybody changed their opinion at all since when they walked in on your I have changed my
(4:49:04) opinion about multiple things i thought perhaps I would be going up against extremely intelligent interlocators who
(4:49:11) are willing to really challenge my worldview and I was wrong
(4:49:17) damn humble i think I think to be challenged you have to come in like open-minded so I
(4:49:23) don't know why do I need to be open-minded to a challenge why shouldn't I be closed-minded until you change my
(4:49:29) mind which is exactly what you said to me when you said I'm a hair supporter however I'm willing to have my mind
(4:49:34) changed that is a close-minded position which is willing to be changed
(4:49:41) true you're not Yeah you're not very open-minded about like not very open-minded yeah gender
(4:49:49) i think it's okay to be willing to listen to arguments but I don't think we necessarily have to be agreeable to them
(4:49:57) um to a degree i think if you already have your principles and values set and somebody tries to come in and knock that
(4:50:03) down I think it's okay to swap back and say no and be careful your mind's not so open your brain falls out
(4:50:11) yes I agree with that too i think when if somebody starts saying things that are completely against my my principles
(4:50:17) like my baseline like I immediately shut off and I'm open sarah I do have to get
(4:50:22) out of here [Music]
(4:50:30) [Music]
