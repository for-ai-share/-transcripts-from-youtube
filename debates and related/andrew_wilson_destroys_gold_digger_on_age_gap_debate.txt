URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DRhF-FvQjE

(0:00) you said you wanted to discuss age gaps in dating and what is appropriate so why don't we start with you and I will open
(0:05) it up to the whole panel go ahead that's a good question um I
(0:13) think if the age Gap is relatively large
(0:18) and I know this can be subjective it does definitely rub me the
(0:24) wrong way whether it's the man that's younger or the woman that's way younger like in both ways it just
(0:30) feels a little bit predatory predatory
(0:35) okay I think before we weigh in on that I I do want to get the answer from the rest of the panel so you think it's a
(0:41) bit predatory do you want to add to your answer at all or um no I'll like let everyone else okay so you think you feel
(0:48) it's weird you think it's predatory okay um it gives me icky Vibes icky it
(0:56) gives you Icky Vibes vibes okay how much of an age capap are we talking
(1:03) I mean that's up to the each individual but um I don't know well you're currently in an age Gap relationship
(1:09) isn't that correct something like that what do you mean well you said you're you're 22 he's 32 right around there yes
(1:16) so that what do you mean around there he's older than 32 like 10 15 years older than me how
(1:23) old just say how old he is I don't know people are watching I don't put people in Blast um but like what's the age got
(1:28) like 14 years okay so you're 22 so he's 36 about
(1:35) there yeah maybe it's more okay we'll just here yeah you're friends with her
(1:40) do you object to her relationship do you think her relationship is predatory well so i' I've met wait did
(1:47) you just say a little bit what no no no no no no no no I mean like I I might have heard wrong but it
(1:53) sounded like you whispered a little bit no no no I was saying like no it's not predatory no friends with her she's
(2:00) dating this guy do you think that that's a predatory relationship well having
(2:05) actually met this person and like gotten to know him no so of course it it does
(2:11) depend on so it's okay for your friends to date have age gaps I didn't say that
(2:16) for me I also said it was subjective how big of the age Gap it is well it's it's a what if it was four years older than
(2:23) he is now then would it be too much I don't think that's a large age Gap though what's large for AG Gap is if
(2:30) they're within 5 years of like one of my parents ages so like my my youngest
(2:36) parent is my stepdad he's 40 so yeah I guess 35 would be at the
(2:44) like pushing it like that's a pretty big age Gap so me personally I don't object to as long as they're both adults um but
(2:54) I would say that most people who do object to age gaps would probably find her age Gap relationship ship
(3:00) objectionable she's 22 I don't I don't find it objectionable
(3:05) but I think a lot of people would that who object to age gaps would she's 22 dating a 36-year-old 14e age Gap and in
(3:14) this case you just said it's okay because her older guys anyway I was
(3:20) still like I was still a little bit concerned like wanting to know what his intentions were so I like it does depend
(3:27) on the person at the end of the day like you can so then they're not predatory then no I mean they can't be predatory
(3:34) if they're not predatory right they're only predatory based on the individuals right yeah so that could be true about a
(3:40) 22-year- old 23y old could be predatory so just for context I mean I was interested in somebody before who was a
(3:47) little bit older than 35 36 and that felt very
(3:53) predatory um because of the individual involved because of the individual but you said you were interested in him well
(3:59) both vice versa right but I'm saying the dynamic itself kind of felt very predatory right like why like you know
(4:07) like we just didn't have anything in common like going out the looks sorry going out the looks what do you mean the
(4:14) looks you know because but you said you were interested in him we were both I
(4:20) was we were both interested in each other but I'm saying like that relationship compared to like this one
(4:25) now feels very different like I don't really even notice the age Gap but I do
(4:31) prefer older men like I don't think I could date somebody my age okay but so why was that specific
(4:39) one predatory we didn't have anything in common so if you don't have something in
(4:44) like so let's say a 23 interested but let's say let's say a 23 and a 22y old
(4:50) have nothing in common that was just one of the things is it predatory to not have anything in common no no no that
(4:55) was just one of the things um he didn't he like aged poorly so like but you said
(5:01) you were interested in him I was how was him aging poorly mean he's predatory no no no no I said I said if it felt weird
(5:08) like maybe maybe feeling weird is a better a better way to describe it but the dynamic just did not flow very well
(5:15) um but you said it predat and it felt inappropriate yeah but that's the part the inappropriate predatory whatever
(5:21) that is right right because I think um when I first started um engaging with
(5:26) this person um I kind of had a blinders on to you know the actual age Gap itself
(5:31) because everything was just going so great and so quickly um so you ignored the age in Le of
(5:36) what and a stuff and [ __ ] stuff and things just just just it was very was it
(5:42) for stuff and things it was very exciting was it for stuff and things did you ignore the age gap for stuff and
(5:48) things I would say more experiences it was very exciting but experiences like
(5:54) stuff and things I'll just give an example I hope he's not watching this I really do um um so like what was this
(6:01) last February I was intending to go to New York for Spring Break um with my
(6:07) friends and I was just chatting to him about it and he was like no don't go by
(6:13) yourself like I'll arrange the whole trip and arrange like a weekday at a beautiful here come here
(6:20) comes the things let's hear about the things it was just like an unforgettable experience you know but a lot of attention to detail like it was like wow
(6:28) you know so for the material gains you ignor the hang on hang on for the material gains you ignor the age right
(6:34) but he was also a really really funny guy addressed very well too it's just after a while I was just like this is
(6:40) just not going to work you know I'm not very attracted to you at all so for the material gains I never told him to do
(6:47) this he did this for me you know right no I get it but I'm just saying like
(6:53) well you know I'm not attracted to you right this isn't really going anywhere but thanks for the [ __ ] right like I
(7:00) mean come right is that basically what happened I mean after a while yes it did Fizz out yes correct but compared to
(7:07) this one this one is like fresh and like sexy you know okay getting everybody else's
(7:14) thoughts on age Gap relationships General answer no again it depends on
(7:20) the individuals involved well of course but I
(7:27) me I mean again keeping it genuine there are times
(7:32) like if I saw a 50-year-old man dating an 18-year-old girl admittedly I'd get
(7:38) the ick wait hold wait wait sorry an older man dating a what like an 18-year-old girl oh 18-year-old girl
(7:45) okay that being said um actually listening to you on this podcast I have
(7:51) learned I need to set aside my feelings and think about okay what is the morality of the situation so if I look
(7:58) at that no problemo they're problem right so this is the thing right all the objections are always
(8:06) just I like this why I don't know and it's just like well then I don't give a
(8:11) [ __ ] right just that's that's just me I think the only valid maybe like
(8:17) argument you could make there is like your cognitive function isn't quite set in until you're about 25 no that's not
(8:22) even true for everybody I heard that was fake news it is fake news in fact the series of sociological studies which you
(8:28) would be referencing to bring up the cognitive disparity between no these are sociological
(8:36) studies Neuroscience especially will be the this inside of the neuroscientific field especially what you're talking
(8:42) about is one specific part of the brain which isn't fully developed in a human adult female until they're 26 say the
(8:48) prefrontal cortex is that it that's that one part but the thing is is like but
(8:53) how much does it does it diminish your cognitive ability by 1% I mean it rings true for me I I I do feel like once I
(9:01) got to about 25 like yeah but you have a whole ton of experience a lot more ability to to make better decisions but
(9:09) the problem with this is let's assume for a second that every year you got older it increase your cognitive ability
(9:15) or whatever by 1% or 2% or something like this some you know kind of smallish
(9:21) uh type percentage now let's assume that that never occurred it just stopped at
(9:26) 2% less than what it is now or 1% less than it is now and you had the same exact 10 years of experience you would
(9:33) still be way [ __ ] smarter than you would be when you were 16 or 18 or 19 or 20 you would still be so that the
(9:40) question becomes is it experience or is it the fact that your brain's not completely 100% developed until you're
(9:47) 26 years old that just seems absurd to me it's like you weren't that much smarter at 26 than you were at 24 or
(9:54) even at 22 obviously it's Progressive you know yeah that's why I'm saying but is it Progressive due to experience or
(9:59) because your your brain isn't completely developed till you're 26 that's the question I mean I think that is what the
(10:06) studies show is that your prefrontal cortex kind of completely it's it's sort of for can we google the the whole like
(10:13) 25 pront there's multiple there's multiple data samples on this and no
(10:19) it's not showing that you somehow get the like when you turn 26 the day you
(10:25) turn 26 you're like oh Eureka my brain's done developing now I can go get that man that I want that
(10:32) does that just seem absurd on its face no I don't think it's like a happens in one night right well it doesn't happen
(10:38) it happens it's a gradual transition but if you're 23 versus 26 how much more
(10:44) intelligent are you because of your brain development that's the question I think it's a question of experience
(10:49) versus 26 I think that's I think everybody but that's a question of experience not necessarily a question of
(10:55) brain function so I'm saying that both the distinction between your brain at 18 26 you'd have to demonstrate that it's
(11:02) so significant that if you were to leave it the same and give the same amount of experience between those two ages
(11:07) there'd be some massive difference that's what those studies fail to show that's my whole problem with it I mean I
(11:13) I haven't actually looked at studies I don't know if you have but I have this would this comes up quite often and
(11:18) that's my whole problem with it it's like well let's let's see what would happen if if we were able to demonstrate
(11:24) well we stopped it from 20 to 26 and they have the exact same experiences how much of a different person would they be
(11:30) that's a much larger question so I'm not willing to just say well because the brain's not fully developed the day they
(11:36) turn 26 they can go get what the Yeah but I think you at least you would agree that you know an 18-year-old probably
(11:42) isn't as as good at making uh judgments as a as a 25 26 well then should they be
(11:48) able to vote against a 26y old and cancel out their very well-informed vote
(11:54) I mean I don't know I'm haven't thought about you don't know well if they should if you're saying that well the
(11:59) experience of an 18-year-old woman is such that she could never make the same type of judgment call that a 50-year-old
(12:06) man can fair enough then why should she be able to cancel out his vote I mean I
(12:12) I I've never stated that that I believe that she should that's why I asked should she I I mean I don't know I
(12:17) haven't thought about it well you should think about it because this is the same type of argument it's like at what point
(12:22) are they an adult and if they're an adult are they an adult or are they not and if they're not when are they and if
(12:27) they're not what resp responsibility should they have or shouldn't they have cuz I don't I'm not willing to be like well Johnny you can go to war but you
(12:34) can't go after a 50-year-old woman it's like well no I'm not so sure I'm willing to make that call or you know hey Tim
(12:41) yeah sure you got drafted but you can't smoke till you're 21 because well society's just said it gives him the ick
(12:48) right it gives him the ick that you smoked Timmy now go over and fight the enemies of the United States that just
(12:54) seems absurd to me you know what I mean so when I look at it I'm like I mean I agree with that yeah if this is an
(12:59) experience-based thing right well 18-year-old woman could be drafted if an 18-year- old woman was drafted then is
(13:05) she cognitive enough and smart enough to go out with a 50y old should be dra drafted at all I think women should be drafted but if they were but let's just
(13:11) say that they were that they should be drafted women like men were drafted it's like there's a war right we need you in
(13:18) the field you're drafted just like 18-year-old Johnny over there okay I mean can she go for a 50-year-old man
(13:24) then is she is she smart enough then to make those decisions I think legally she should be
(13:30) able to I agree with the legal age of 18 we have to set some age moral so what's the moral argument well the moral
(13:36) argument is like everything is has is Nuance so I mean you have to look at every unique situ moral argument is that
(13:41) everything is Nuance I'm saying things have Nuance so yeah know things have Nuance but there's
(13:47) no we're just talking like okay here's stock 18-year-old girl and stock 15 50-year-old man like I think there's a
(13:52) reason why people may get uncomfortable when they hear that and I think it's valid it probably comes out of a real do you think that your grandparents were
(13:58) uncomfortable with that your great-grandparents were uncomfortable with that cuz the answer is not really
(14:04) it was not a not a huge social issue of the time I I think it has been actually
(14:09) no it hasn't been it was never a big social issue that there was these large age gaps I know back like M like
(14:17) probably like 2,000 years ago it wasn't well let me give you a different example let see World War II by the end of World
(14:23) War II France's male population been decimated mostly the young men because
(14:28) they just had two world wars mhm the female population wasn't decimated age gaps were pretty wide
(14:36) right by necess how you going to procreate right there's no other men except these is it immoral then I'm not
(14:44) saying it I've never made the Blen statement that it's immoral though right so I mean if it's but is it situationally immoral or is it just
(14:50) really that it gives you the ick I think it's situationally immoral like to try
(14:56) it's a slightly different situation but I'll try make an example you know if there's a kid like I have to be responsible with
(15:04) with uh someone who's a minor in in other dimensions do you know what I'm saying no but I want to be charitable to
(15:11) what you're saying so I'm trying to think of a good example but like a minor another di do you mean like their
(15:18) cognitive function is if they're 18 is like that of a 15y old you have to look out for people younger than you and and
(15:24) there's definitely a chance to take advantage of their innocence so I think that that I think that's generally what
(15:30) we're getting at you know what I'm saying yeah but you don't there doesn't even need to be an age gap for that you
(15:36) just take advantage of them anyway at the same age take advantage of them I mean there's obviously a serious problem
(15:42) with taking advantage of people who are much younger than you because they're lack of experience in but there would be a serious problem for anybody to take
(15:48) advantage of anybody for any reason right what do you mean so like let's say a 50-year-old guy is taking advantage of
(15:55) the niev of a 19-year-old girl in order to I don't know get her do whatever the hell it is that he wants versus a
(16:01) 21-year-old guy I see why it's immoral more immoral just because the guyy is 50 versus 21 I don't see what the
(16:07) difference is I would think he would know better than the 21y old but I say both but I'm just saying it seems like
(16:13) it's just equally bad to me doesn't seem like there's this was more bad to that because like a 20-year-old 20-year-old
(16:20) doesn't have as much experience as a 50-year-old I think they would know better just my general sense get yeah I get it I understand what you're saying
(16:26) but you could have a 25-year-old and a 24-year-old girl and he is vastly
(16:31) more intelligent and vastly more experienced than she is usually not though but you could right and there's
(16:38) no ick there the only ick would be in the distinction for age and it's only due to like some kind of preference but
(16:44) if we were look at the immoral action of 50-year-old man takes advantage of 19-year-old girl it's like oh yeah
(16:49) that's bad but if 21-year-old takes advantage of 18-year-old girl that's still just as bad and also as a
(16:56) 50-year-old man wouldn't you want somebody who has a little more experience I don't know what their preferences are but the question the
(17:03) question to me is not even the question to me is not why do you prefer this
(17:08) thing X but whether or not is this thing even a problem so is it actually even a
(17:13) problem that a 50-year-old might you usually see people together who are roughly the same age I think that's
(17:19) because they grew up in the same era that as peers you tend to be able to
(17:25) connect on a lot more so I think maybe that's why okay maybe something off there maybe that's a red FL unless this Social Circle becomes reduced due to
(17:32) external external factors like for instance War if 40 or 50% of your male population young male population totally
(17:39) decimated now you have these extreme age gaps now it's necessary so in that case
(17:44) is that okay yeah I think that's fair well then if that's okay you're really just saying there's nothing really
(17:49) immoral here I never said it was never if there's nothing immoral then why do we care that's my question flag it's
(17:55) definitely a red flag okay well now that's fair right you could say it's a red flag or something that you would
(18:00) look out for that's fair enough but I'm just saying I don't see a problem with it per se not necessarily which I so
(18:08) your thoughts uh I think as long as both parties are consenting adults it's fine
(18:14) there you have it there you have it going back to some of you who said that you find it predatory or icky do you
(18:21) care to elaborate on your answers how is it
(18:26) predatory so well I'd like to not exactly change my answer but I'll add
(18:32) more I think it's different if two people meet they don't know how old they are they happen to have a connection and
(18:37) then you know like it it just it happens to be a pretty large age Gap but if like an older man and older woman is
(18:44) purposefully going on dating apps and making their age range very young like
(18:49) purposefully looking for these younger women that's when it feels pretty predatory cuz you're actively seeking
(18:56) someone way younger than you or if you have some type of age cut off wait an age cut off yeah like if
(19:02) you're like oh I don't want to a woman would you date a 70-year-old man no what are you doing with this age cut off no
(19:09) I'm saying what if you didn't know his age it would make it okay then right he only thought he was 45 no but what I'm
(19:16) saying is like let's say you meet someone and they happen to
(19:21) be I don't know whatever age cut off like a lot of might have like 30 cut offs or yeah like 30 they're older than
(19:28) 30 and you're like no even though they're closer to your own age that means you want them to be significantly
(19:34) younger than you so what if a man he's in his 40s he wants to start a family okay he hasn't been able to for whatever
(19:41) reason okay may he's been like longterm in the military maybe he has other things going on right he has not been
(19:47) able to but he's accruit a ton of resources so he starts researching goes online he's like how can I have a nice
(19:53) big family what are the things I should be looking for do you think fertile woman would be like one of those big
(19:59) criteria for that if you wanted to have a family fertility in women would be a big one
(20:07) right what are the other options yeah well first of all there even though the
(20:12) percentage of women that are still fer atile is less as they get older there still are some or if you really want so
(20:20) if you want to have nine kids you probably wouldn't want to marry a 30-year-old right but if you want children that badly you could adopt
(20:29) adoption yeah but you could also marry a 25-year-old there are also women who freeze their eggs yeah I know but but
(20:35) what if you again you could just marry a fertile 25-year-old too you could be a
(20:40) 40-year-old man and go well he's 25 so I get the maximum amount of fertility I want to have seven eight kids but then
(20:47) why weren't you trying to start that family maybe just because you were trying to acrw resources so you could
(20:52) and then if the 25-year-old says yeah you have the resources I really dig you I think you're great uh I want to give
(20:58) you nine kids I could not imagine anybody at this table could ever give me
(21:03) a single problem with that from a moral standpoint ever I don't think it would even be possible wait I have a question
(21:12) so well let's let her respond before do you have a response he's well I I want to hear what H's no
(21:20) no no no no no no no so Andrew said he doesn't think anybody at this table
(21:26) would be able to raise an objection over think anybody in this country could raise an objection to this from a moral
(21:31) standpoint that would be in any way coherent but I would love to hear it I if I can add on to your
(21:38) question without raising an actual argument or objection do you find the
(21:45) scenario that he painted predatory or icky 40-year-old
(21:53) 25-year-old a little bit yeah okay a 40-year-old with a
(21:59) 25-year-old correct um her prefrontal cortex is fully developed at this point
(22:05) bear in mind close enough anyway um no
(22:10) no no who cares they're both happy yeah it's Beau it's beautiful go ahead what's
(22:16) your question so I was just asking for a friend do you think it's do you think
(22:21) that from a woman's perspective having kids at 25 with
(22:27) someone is 40 is disadvantageous I can't figure out how
(22:33) it would be disadvantageous from a logical standpoint it could be from um some kind of preferential standpoint how
(22:40) old is Henry cavil caval his deine they could say for instance um 40 wait can
(22:47) can I jump in here really quick you're you know who Henry caval is Nick could
(22:53) you Google Henry Cav said Superman Superman Superman yeah thanks uh The Witcher the tutors if anybody I don't
(22:59) know if anybody knows the great actor oh I know him yeah uh very handsome man 40
(23:04) years old didn't he play Superman too yeah Superman yeah so what what was your
(23:10) question the 40y old and the 25-year old I was asking do you think it's disadvantageous for a 25y old woman to
(23:16) have babies let me ask do you think it would be disadvantage disadvantageous for a 25-year-old woman to have ch
(23:22) children with Henry caval no do you think do you think a lot of 25-year-old women
(23:28) would jump at the chance to be with Henry forget that for a second let me ask this easier let's say for somehow I
(23:35) don't know how okay but they were they froze sperm from a guy from 1915 who
(23:43) died okay 1915 they had the Frozen sperm and a woman wanted to become a
(23:49) mother right and she looked through and she's like oh I really want this guy from
(23:55) 1915 I want to have his babies right right and so she like artificially inseminated herself and she had the baby
(24:03) okay well didn't she actually have a child then with a dude who's like over a
(24:09) hundred years old no no well wait I'm a little
(24:15) confused by this one myself didn't she if you freeze the sperm uhhuh right
(24:22) they're like they're frozen yeah so it's not like it's this 100-year-old like
(24:27) living it's his 18yearold sperm or something I guess well what if it's his 50-year-old
(24:32) sperm I don't know that seems like what if they froze it when
(24:38) he's 90 but it's just sperm it's not like you're having intercourse yeah you
(24:43) don't have a relationship with that person and like what you were saying earlier so then if if that's true then
(24:48) is that saying that you can be in a relationship with an 80-year-old man and
(24:54) as long as you don't have a intercourse with him and you just like I don't know he jerks off in a cup and you inseminate
(25:00) yourself then that relationship then is fine or no no this is what I mean is
(25:06) like I think that like she says she says there's all kinds of nuance and I'm like let's see if we can find the craziest
(25:12) Nuance we can in 80-year-old in a cup is pretty crazy it's pretty nuanced yeah
(25:17) pretty nuanced yeah but can can I ask you something so you were growing hie a
(25:23) little bit when she was talking about wanting these like material things
(25:28) from a man blah blah whatever and then she brought up children and you were
(25:33) like that's a material thing as well and now you're saying material conditions for children yeah yeah and now you're
(25:39) saying so you're like oh it's wrong I don't know if this is what you meant but this is how it sounded like that it's
(25:47) not good to just seek someone for these material things but then in your scenario when you're talking about this four-year-old man actively seeking
(25:54) someone younger just for the material thing being the children that you what happened is she asked would it be
(26:00) disadvantageous for a 25-year-old woman right to um get you know get married to
(26:08) a 40-year-old man and have his babies I can't think of how that would be disadvantageous well I'm talking about what we were talking about like a couple
(26:14) hours ago yeah but you're conflating two different things so the question which was asked is how would this be disadvantageous I don't see how it could
(26:20) be disadvantageous I mean I don't think it's disadvantageous per
(26:26) se but I still think that like if the only reason you're trying to like build
(26:34) a relationship with someone younger than you is to have children with them then that's like why would you do that to
(26:41) perpetuate to perpetuate the human species so people like you can be alive no but the other core values that you
(26:46) were talking about earlier like integrity and loyalty and all that like you can have all of those things together you can but what if you can't
(26:54) find that and you only find like that's pretty hard to find
(27:00) virtuously okay so you mean what happens if you can't find a virtuous woman at the age of 25 yeah so are you just going
(27:06) to settle for someone who you don't have that same connection with but they're 25
(27:11) children or would you rather be with someone who's older so now so now if you
(27:17) want to make the shift from whether or not it's just advantageous and you're talking specifically about the core of
(27:23) relationship Dynamic for preference and you're like is it is the preference for
(27:28) this guy to to only have nine kids if that's the case then I guess he could compromise on his values but if the
(27:34) preference is not that if the preference is he wants to have nine kids and a virtuous woman then yeah he might have
(27:40) to compromise on his standards I don't see how he how he wouldn't be you know I mean as far as looks and this type of
(27:46) thing or am I misinterpreting your question or am I getting something wrong here well just cuz you were saying that
(27:54) like a 40-year-old man who really wants a family like really really badly
(27:59) they're going to only look at younger women because they have a higher chance of being fertile and being able to give
(28:06) you those CH no I'm not saying they only would but I would understand why they would can I play Devil's Advocate from
(28:11) my original point this topic so if I am a hot 25-year-old woman okay and this
(28:19) 40-year-old man wants me to have his kids don't you think that he should be
(28:25) providing for us to have for me to even consider having his kids or no I think
(28:30) that he should be in a position in which he can provide for the children and his family especially at almost 15 yeah 15
(28:36) years older M does that mean taking you to the Bahamas and giving you $10,000 or
(28:41) I never said give $10,000 is that $10,000 a month for you to go ziplining and hang lighting that's providing for
(28:47) you and the kids no no it's not no it's not y'all taking my words out of my mouth what I'm just saying I'm just
(28:53) saying is like at that that dinosaur age
(28:59) you should wow you you should be doing more than if I'm gonna go have kids with
(29:04) somebody my age that's just my take that you should be doing more yeah do you
(29:10) think that do you think that a man who is in his 40s who by your own admission is going to have more resource than man
(29:15) at 25 you'd have ch don't you think he'd be better to provide for your children no that's what I'm saying yeah well then
(29:21) he is doing more no I'm just asking he's just not doing more for you he's doing more for the Offspring
(29:28) just not for you so by default that you don't get the pearls you know the the kids get new clothes that's that's how
(29:34) it goes you know you don't get the pearls you don't get the big diamond the kids get the better school the kids get
(29:40) the better education kids get the better life that sounds like a sad life I will just it sounds like a sad
(29:46) life to pref to make a the preferences the children over yourself no why can't
(29:52) we all have a beautiful life well I mean what you could right you you can't you
(29:59) know what you can have it all you can have five kids and $10,000 Bahama vacations and just kind of everything
(30:05) you want it doesn't cost $110,000 princess treatment okay princess treatment uh a couple questions here
(30:12) with bricks with gold in their pockets just waiting they can't wait to have nine nine kids oh a couple things here
