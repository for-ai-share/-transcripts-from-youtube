(0:00) so yeah I have a I do have an issue with
(0:02) these red pill podcasts I have an issue
(0:04) with red pill in general uh I'm a
(0:07) Christian first before anything so my
(0:10) opening statement is really the red pill
(0:12) podcasts such as the whatever podcast
(0:14) which is the one in question today are
(0:16) exploitative and destructive in nature
(0:19) they advertise porn stars and
(0:20) promiscuous women as the thumbnails to
(0:22) every upload and plug their social media
(0:25) accounts in the bio of every video the
(0:28) women don't go on the show to debate
(0:30) they go on there for attention and clout
(0:33) the show is masqueraded as a debate but
(0:34) in reality it's an only fans Ad Agency
(0:37) I'll con see that yeah there's some
(0:39) utility in going on these shows to
(0:41) combat these feminist ideologies however
(0:44) that utility is immediately lost when
(0:46) you advertise the very thing that you
(0:48) claim to be against the equivalent would
(0:51) be as though a podcast that claimed to
(0:52) be anti-drugs brought drug dealers onto
(0:55) the show put the picture of the product
(0:58) the drug as the thumbnail to every
(1:00) episode and plug the drug dealers
(1:02) address in the bio of every video so all
(1:04) the people watching know where to go and
(1:05) buy the product my argument is we should
(1:08) combat the modernity of feminist
(1:10) ideologies without advertising their
(1:12) product which in this case is their body
(1:15) young men should instead turn to Christ
(1:17) and stay away from engaging with red
(1:19) pill podcasts and red pill ideologies
(1:22) the real solution and simple call to
(1:24) action is for men as a collective to
(1:26) turn away from porn cease engaging with
(1:29) thirst trap content online cease
(1:31) engaging in hookup culture turn to God
(1:33) and date with the intention of marriage
(1:36) and this is not a surprise from the
(1:38) Christian world view which I believe
(1:40) that we share the red pill podcasts in
(1:43) this business are in this business for
(1:44) the same reason for the women that they
(1:46) bring on attention and money as a
(1:49) Christian the only reason we should go
(1:51) on the show is to hold the red pill
(1:53) hosts accountable for the degeneracy
(1:56) that they are engaging in by profiting
(1:57) off of being an of Ad Agency
(2:00) by exploiting the pain of their male
(2:01) audience red pill podcasts have taken a
(2:04) number of traditional biblical
(2:05) principles and twisted them for their
(2:07) selfish desire to guide men into a life
(2:10) of worshiping money and
(2:13) sex all right Andrew do
(2:16) you want to go ahead and use your opener
(2:20) yeah yeah I appreciate that thank you
(2:22) for the uh for the opening statement
(2:24) glad I got your kind of positions down
(2:26) here so let me um let me respond
(2:30) I I didn't know for sure what my
(2:32) opponent's criticisms were going to be
(2:34) um just yet um I have ascertained a bit
(2:38) of information via DMS so let me go over
(2:41) his arguments as I understand them one
(2:44) his first argument seemed to be to point
(2:46) to the fact that going on whatever was
(2:48) problematic is everything that has
(2:50) needed to be said has been said whatever
(2:53) the [ __ ] that mean I don't know what
(2:54) that means I find this argument amusing
(2:56) though as if you don't you can't go to
(2:58) this guy's Instagram
(3:00) uh like he's saying something that's
(3:02) super new that other larger content
(3:04) creators than himself have already said
(3:06) they have so I'll assume he's just
(3:08) confused about that argument too his
(3:11) second argument points out that girls
(3:14) engaged in sex work can and do gain some
(3:18) of the whatever audience to then
(3:21) subscribe to their sex
(3:23) channels I don't dispute that this is
(3:25) true I just don't particularly care the
(3:28) types of men who are watching whatever
(3:31) and would subscribe to only fans
(3:33) prostitution were likely already
(3:35) subscribed to only fans prostitution it
(3:38) seems reasonable to me that if invited
(3:40) on to provide push back to their various
(3:42) claims that is more effective than
(3:45) pretending that whatever is cranking out
(3:47) simps Brian seems to mostly be against
(3:50) the modernity of dating and prostitution
(3:53) though he doesn't have as hard a line of
(3:54) a stance as I do but he allows push back
(3:57) for everybody including the guests which
(3:59) are on his show his third argument makes
(4:02) no sense to me at all my opponent seems
(4:04) to think that ignoring this problem
(4:06) makes it go away but it doesn't make it
(4:09) go away push back and resistance make it
(4:12) go away I think it's important we be
(4:14) present in all places the DG are to take
(4:16) on their worldviews his final argument
(4:20) is that I need to attack or go after
(4:23) Brian though that doesn't make any sense
(4:25) either why would I destroy my
(4:27) opportunity to engage on the platform
(4:29) where I can reach hundreds of thousands
(4:31) of people with a better message not to
(4:33) mention Brian brings up valid and
(4:35) interesting arguments which I often
(4:37) agree with we may not align 100% but we
(4:40) don't need to as reaching the audience
(4:42) is my objective not reaching [ __ ]
(4:46) Brian he start he starts his claims as
(4:49) well by saying he's against feminist
(4:50) ideology but I did go and review a
(4:52) debate that he had with Destiny where he
(4:54) claimed that feminism is an antidote to
(4:57) what he call considers toxic patriarchy
(5:00) I'm not sure that that's in line with
(5:02) any Christian worldview that I'm aware
(5:03) of but I'm happy to take that topic on
(5:05) as well lastly the only reason to go on
(5:08) the show is to go after the hosy claims
(5:10) that seems stupid to me I think it would
(5:12) be far better to utilize the platform of
(5:15) the host in order to move a message to
(5:18) hundreds of thousands of people who you
(5:20) would not normally have access to that's
(5:24) a far wiser strategy for spreading the
(5:28) message and I'm assuming that we agree
(5:30) on a lot of this message and so what we
(5:33) have is a differing of tactics uh
(5:35) however it's insane to me that he also
(5:38) wanted to go on the whatever podcast
(5:40) himself which is odd I would assume
(5:43) because he wants hundreds of thousands
(5:45) of people to hear his message as well so
(5:48) uh with that I'll yield the rest of my
(5:50) time and I'm happy to get into
(5:57) this all right RC um
() 
(6:00) would you like to respond well we're
(6:02) just gonna go we're just gonna go open
(6:04) from here yep open dialogue from here go
(6:06) ahead RC so to address I mean you
(6:09) brought up a number of points uh to
(6:11) address your last point I I didn't shy
(6:15) away from the fact that I said as a
(6:16) Christian you can go on the podcast to
(6:19) call out what red pill is doing wrong I
(6:22) yes I did ask to go on to the whatever
(6:24) podcast what about the things that
(6:25) they're doing right can you agree with
(6:27) the things that they're doing right
(6:29) while
(6:30) while simultaneously calling out the
(6:31) things that are wrong so well I'm
(6:33) addressing what you'd said right so in
(6:35) May of 2023 I did ask the whatever
(6:37) podcast and I DMD Brian privately asking
(6:41) if I can go on the show so I can call
(6:42) out red pill I was very clear with why
(6:44) my intention is to go on to the show and
(6:47) and Brian went on to block me because I
(6:50) and he said I'm afraid to bring you on
(6:51) because you're gonna speak disparagingly
(6:53) to the women as though he doesn't do
(6:54) that with every episode and every male
(6:56) guest he has on does the same thing and
(6:59) and he blocked me which is very telling
(7:02) because what are you afraid of um well
(7:04) now hang on let's get into this first so
() 
(7:06) that's a Reader's Digest version but my
(7:09) understanding from having read the DMS
(7:10) that you posted in the Discord was that
(7:12) you were being very agitating towards
(7:14) Brian and if I was running a show and
(7:18) you were being agitating towards me
(7:20) while while you were trying to come on
(7:21) my show what do you think my reaction
(7:23) would be how am I agitating towards
(7:26) Brian when I said I want to go on your
(7:28) show to call out red pill if that's
(7:29) agitating to him that's very telling
(7:31) what his position but what he said is
(7:33) that he wanted to have a more calm
(7:34) collected conversation and he was
(7:36) worried that uh you're over the toop
(7:39) approach would not be good for his
(7:41) platform now it is his platform we can
(7:43) agree that it's his platform whether you
(7:45) like how it's run or not it seems silly
(7:48) to me that you would be agitating
(7:50) towards this guy than expect that he
(7:51) would have you on right so would you
(7:54) agree that this red pill podcast is
(7:56) advertising these only fan women I don't
(7:59) think that they're specifically
() 
(8:00) advertising them but I think that they
(8:02) allow the only fans women to advertise
(8:04) themselves yes they are putting them as
(8:06) the they're using their sexually
(8:07) suggested photos as the thumbnail to
(8:09) every video they put up how is that not
(8:11) direct advertising so that that's how
(8:13) the women show
(8:14) up they no they ask and they use
(8:18) provocative images of those women they
(8:19) don't have to use those images as a
(8:21) thumbnail to their video I mean so what
(8:22) that's what these women themselves what
(8:25) they're showing the best disinfectant is
(8:27) sunlight so adding sunlight to what
(8:30) these women are I think is the best
(8:31) thing that you can possibly do which
(8:33) would include show their show their SE
(8:35) sugges which would include this disc
(8:37) these disgusting poses well here's the
(8:39) thing they go on the show looking like
(8:41) this why would the thumbnail somehow be
(8:43) worse than how they show up to the
(8:45) show because you don't have to put that
(8:47) as a thumbnail it's an intentional
(8:49) clickbait yeah you don't have to let
(8:50) them show up like that to the show but
(8:52) they want to show up like that to the
(8:54) show and the reason that they do is
(8:56) because they want to be as provocative
(8:57) as possible for attention but I think
(9:00) that that's in uh many ways good for our
(9:02) side because it shows a ray of sunlight
(9:05) on what's going on here that women will
(9:08) dress this way in order to go into a
(9:09) live studio in order to promote this
(9:11) type of degeneracy again I think the
(9:14) best disinfectant is sunlight but you
(9:16) don't promote them by advertising the
(9:18) picture as the thumbnail you don't have
(9:20) to do that and they intentionally do it
(9:21) to clickbait well let us assume let us
(9:24) assume for a moment that I just con
(9:25) seeed the point and I say you know
(9:27) you're right uh they really shouldn't
(9:30) use the sexually provocative uh
(9:33) thumbnail so what it's not our platform
(9:36) it's not your platform it's not my
(9:38) platform our job our job is to provide
(9:42) necessary push back to ideological
(9:45) worldviews that we disagree with you
(9:47) would agree that that's true if you're
(9:50) saying that this guy is running this as
(9:51) a business and making money I don't
(9:53) disagree that he is doing so and I don't
(9:55) disagree that uh people love controversy
(9:57) and I don't disagree that part of that
(9:59) controversy can make people money what I
(10:01) do disagree with is that whether or not
(10:04) this guy is advertising this from a
(10:06) thumbnail perspective okay in order to
(10:09) be as provocative as possible to get the
(10:10) most amount of views as possible that
(10:12) also puts the most amount of views on my
(10:16) message so you also in the DMS mentioned
(10:19) that sure it's okay that he plugs their
(10:21) social media accounts in the bio of the
(10:23) video because that's the price to
() 
(10:25) admission yeah well so here's the thing
(10:28) this is what
(10:30) um this is what they're asking him to do
(10:32) if he's willing to link a Christian
(10:34) nationalist bio down there right which
(10:37) is just as polarizing as an only fans
(10:39) girl why should he then not link hers as
(10:42) well just because you [ __ ] disagree
(10:45) right because you just disagree with
(10:46) that side of it but that side of it
(10:48) hates our asses they [ __ ] hate us so
(10:51) he's he's willing to put our bios in
(10:54) there too so he's against Christian
(10:57) nationalism or is he against the fans
(10:59) degenerate feminist
() 
(11:01) ideologies well I'm not sure what his
(11:03) exact ideology is on this it seems to be
(11:05) that there's a mixture he claims to be
(11:07) Christian well he doesn't really he
(11:09) claims that he's not a practicing
(11:10) Christian well he's claims well then he
(11:13) I mean he does flip-flop a lot but he
(11:14) has openly admitted that he said he's
(11:16) Christian but regardless regardless he's
(11:19) very clearly advertising them they come
(11:22) on to be advertised they wouldn't go on
(11:24) if I go on to be advertised what's your
(11:27) point yeah we all do things for
(11:29) attention what type of attention are you
(11:31) looking for whate attention are they
(11:33) looking for I understand that they're
(11:35) looking for the the same kind of counter
(11:37) attention to what I'm looking for I want
(11:39) to draw attention to my message and
(11:42) they're trying to draw attention to
(11:44) their only fans it would actually be a
(11:47) far harder pitch for him to sell that
(11:49) he's only going to link the people in
(11:51) the bio who he agrees with I don't agree
(11:53) with you and I'm still going to link you
(11:55) in the bio is that okay but the problem
(11:58) is his whole show is against their
(12:00) promiscuous ideology and he's
(12:02) advertising it he's an he's a ver
(12:05) figuratively speak he also advertising
(12:07) my ideology but you're not porn starring
(12:10) yourself so what you're really saying is
(12:13) is that it's okay for him to do the
(12:15) thing that you agree with ideologically
(12:18) not okay for him to do the thing that
(12:19) you don't agree with ideologically
(12:21) ideologically it's okay for him to
(12:23) promote me it's just not okay for him to
(12:25) promote the other side in the spirit of
(12:28) fairness you would if you have a
(12:30) contentious Channel like this where
(12:32) people are in consistent arguments and
(12:34) you have polarizing personalities it
(12:36) seems completely reasonable to me that
(12:39) the people who go on in order to do that
(12:41) show would want whatever it is that they
(12:43) want advertised while I agree it's
(12:45) disgusting right I think that engaging
(12:47) with their ideology is still extremely
(12:50) important but that's the whole point is
(12:52) engaging with their ideology so he is
(12:54) promoting them by allowing them on the
(12:56) platform to debate but they don't go on
(12:58) there to debate
(13:00) to adverti their social no they do go on
(13:02) to debate and I've had many many
(13:04) engagements and debates with
(13:06) them the end of the day they don't care
(13:08) if they win or lose they care to promote
(13:09) and advertise their sexual content it
() 
(13:12) could be possible that their alternative
(13:14) motivation is that they don't give a
(13:15) [ __ ] how they do inside of these
(13:17) different debates I can even concede
(13:19) that that's true and it just doesn't
(13:21) hurt my position because it still
(13:23) exposes this rotten ideology and I get
(13:26) hundreds upon hundreds of DMS from the
(13:28) whatever audience themselves personally
(13:30) from them I saw you on whatever you've
(13:33) completely brought me out of this
(13:34) Darkness or I saw you on whatever thank
(13:36) you so much for having any kind of
(13:38) ideological push back to this even if
(13:40) Brian himself was guilty of doing all
(13:42) the things that you claim he's guilty of
(13:44) doing you would still want to have a
(13:46) person like me there to ideologically
(13:48) push back against their
(13:50) worldview and what are you saying any
(13:52) different than every other person that's
(13:55) gone on to contend them what are you
(13:56) saying any different than everything
(13:58) else which is on your Instagram than
(14:00) other creators who have said the exact
(14:01) same plug their social media do I plug
(14:04) their social the argument is still the
(14:05) same you're claiming here this is
(14:07) argument to that you made what are you
(14:09) saying any different than other people
(14:11) who've been on there well clearly I must
(14:12) be saying a lot that's different because
(14:14) the first time many people have ever
(14:15) heard the message at all and the DMS
(14:18) would seem to prove that that's true two
(14:20) there's also a delivery system and a
(14:22) delivery system is important and perhaps
(14:25) my delivery system is so polarizing that
(14:28) it draws attention to the message so
(14:30) just because I may say things that other
(14:33) people have said before me on that
(14:34) broadcast it doesn't mean that they
(14:35) resonate with people all right so you do
(14:39) debate red pill guys on your own
(14:41) platform do you not and on whatever
(14:44) correct but I'm you do hold those guys
(14:47) accountable on your own
(14:49) platform yeah I I engage with their
() 
(14:51) ideology on this platform that's correct
(14:54) and I also put hang on I also put their
(14:56) links in the description am I doing
(14:58) something wrong
(14:59) wrong but they're not promoting sex
(15:03) content are oh yes they are I've had D
(15:06) I've had [ __ ] degens on this platform
(15:09) right who not only have uh participated
(15:12) in pornography themselves and have
(15:14) talked about it and have talked about it
(15:16) openly okay because I want to engage
(15:19) with their ideology it's [ __ ]
(15:21) important you're a Christian why would
(15:23) you advertise pornography not adver
() 
(15:25) listen listen so that you understand if
(15:28) somebody goes down and they watch this
(15:30) entire debate and they click the link
(15:32) cuz they want to go watch this guy's
(15:34) pornography they were going to go watch
(15:36) pornography anyway they were going to be
(15:38) doing that [ __ ] anyway nobody came
(15:41) nobody's ever going to come to one of
(15:42) these debates and go wow well this this
(15:45) red pill guy or this prostitute made
(15:47) such a great point I just can't help but
(15:50) go now and watch their pornography
(15:52) that's Insanity they were already
(15:54) [ __ ] DG to begin with right you're
(15:57) just you're just upset at the
(15:59) way in which it's filtered they're still
(16:01) going to go find that stuff if they want
(16:02) to find it no you just don't engage with
(16:05) it you do not to go on there and promote
(16:08) their social media accounts you don't
(16:10) you stop short of that be a Christian
(16:12) first yeah that's right I should stop
(16:13) the message to hundreds of thousands of
(16:15) people because your comfortability at
(16:17) the fact that people request that their
(16:20) links when they go on to have their
(16:22) ideology confronted be linked out for
(16:25) them that seems stupid to me when you
(16:27) did a debate with Destiny Destiny put
(16:30) your link down in the
(16:32) bio did you call Destiny and chastise
(16:35) him for putting your link in the bio
(16:37) even though he promoted something he
(16:39) clearly didn't agree
(16:41) with how was that at all the same answer
(16:44) my question did you answer my question
(16:48) did you call Destiny and ask him to
(16:51) remove your bio uh from his from him
(16:54) promoting it he's a [ __ ] dgen he was
(16:56) in an open marriage he's done horrible
(16:59) [ __ ] things why would you allow your
(17:01) name to be posted on that channel why
(17:04) why don't you show where he uh he
(17:06) plugged me he put your yeah he put your
(17:09) links down this is in the uh Destiny
(17:11) Clips yeah he put your link in the bio
(17:13) and not only that you announced what
(17:15) your name was live on the broadcast that
(17:17) is a form of promotion and you promoted
(17:19) yourself on a degenerates
(17:22) channel how dare you what sort of
(17:25) Christian psychopath are
(17:27) you so he promoted my link which I was
(17:30) unaware of did not go on the show to
(17:33) have my link promoted it's not the
(17:34) reason I went on to the show these only
(17:36) fans girls go on the show what did you
(17:38) go on the show for to stand for truth
(17:41) that's right you went on the DG's
(17:42) platform in order to stand for truth and
(17:44) clearly you thought it was worth it to
(17:46) do so so what the [ __ ] could your
(17:49) criticism of me possibly be when you did
(17:51) the exact same thing no cuz you're going
(17:54) on a show that's literally an open ad
(17:56) only fans Ad Agency so destiny Destiny
(17:59) is one of the biggest promoters of sex
(18:01) work that I've ever seen in my life he
(18:02) thinks it's absolutely fine and you were
(18:05) all over that platform and you didn't
(18:06) give a [ __ ] and I debated against it but
(18:09) he's that's right the same [ __ ] that I
(18:11) do you debated against it just like me
(18:14) he's not an only fans girl and he
(18:15) doesn't have a plethora of the guy no
(18:17) it's worse it's it's worse he's done
(18:20) literally this guy has had sex with tons
(18:23) of women who have only fans profiles
(18:25) he's had sex with tons of sex workers by
(18:27) his own admission he is in an open
(18:29) marriage with his own wife I think that
(18:31) the prostitutes on only fans are
(18:33) probably better yeah but in the in the
(18:37) example you're trying to bring up in
(18:38) this gotcha I debated against the host
(18:40) you agree with the host of the whatever
(18:41) podcast I debate with the host too the
(18:43) last episode I just debated with him on
(18:46) his worldview of marriage literally on
(18:48) his podcast have you ever live on the
(18:50) podcast asked him if you're against
(18:52) these only fans women why do you plug
(18:53) their social media accounts no I don't
(18:55) need to ask him an obvious question I
(18:57) under I know what the answer is why
(18:59) would I ask him something I know the
(19:00) answer to it's the same reason it's the
(19:02) same reason you went on Destiny's
(19:03) program the reason because I'm I'm
(19:06) giving you a parallel example where you
(19:09) yourself will go on degenerates platform
(19:11) in order to debate their ideology I do
(19:13) the exact same thing to stand against
(19:16) him I'm not standing and what do you
(19:18) think I'm doing what do you think I'm
(19:19) doing I'm standing against their
(19:21) ideology across the board regardless of
(19:25) alignment how how am I in alignment when
(19:28) you go on there the majority of the time
(19:29) you're debating against the women or
(19:31) you're debating against
(19:32) Brian and how would that be alignment
(19:36) because you're bringing up Destiny and
(19:38) the entire time I debated against
(19:40) Destiny the entire time I debate against
(19:43) any points which are made that I
(19:44) disagree with regardless of who they're
(19:46) from doesn't matter if they're from
(19:47) Brian it doesn't matter if they're from
(19:49) the women it wouldn't matter if it was
(19:50) from you it wouldn't matter who it's
(19:52) from and I don't care um you know these
(19:56) massive platforms that have hundreds of
(19:58) thousands of viewers your tactic is
(20:01) suicide for us your tactic of staying
(20:03) away because you're concerned about the
(20:05) promotion of degeneracy in society is
(20:07) exactly what happened in the early Blood
(20:09) Sport debate era let me explain this to
(20:11) you so that you understand and maybe
(20:13) this will help change your worldview
(20:14) early conservatism on YouTube all fell
(20:17) on their sword to do the exact same
(20:18) thing you're talking about oh this is
(20:20) against TOS we're going to violate the
(20:22) to on purpose so that they have to
(20:24) deplatform us that'll teach them a
(20:26) lesson they all got deplatformed and all
(20:29) that happened was the degeneracy ran
(20:30) wild with no [ __ ] check at all like a
(20:33) firestorm through the internet the
(20:35) Communists got popular the leftists got
(20:37) popular you know who didn't get [ __ ]
(20:39) popular the right-wingers who got thrown
(20:41) the [ __ ] off the platform they went off
(20:43) to have Stellar career ending careers
(20:47) okay I mean that's that's what happened
(20:48) their careers ended and it's because
(20:51) they had the same type of mentality that
(20:53) you have you need to be where these
(20:55) people are and you need to be fighting
(20:56) the good fight not uh not going oh my I
(21:01) can't believe that an only fans girl
(21:03) would dress provocative yeah we know
(21:05) what they are we know what they are your
(21:07) mission is to reach out to the hundreds
(21:08) of thousands of viewers not to hold your
(21:11) pearls at a [ __ ] thumbnail that's
(21:13) insane
