(0:01) [Music]
(0:08) [Music] T to critically think so you can't think
(0:14) your way out of stuff the the biggest problem with our
(0:21) school system the way I see it today is no one is taught to critically think so
(0:27) you can't think your way out of stuff anymore and people are just so happy with all the BS going on I mean we got
(0:34) families and single grown-ups moving into houses living with strangers because that's the only way they can
(0:39) afford it and they're they're not even mad about it let's just it's like friends we're just gonna be good like a TV show nah you too broke to be able to
(0:47) afford to sustain yourself that's I mean that's a problem but they don't want to add address the problem they just want
(0:54) to sit there and you know don't take away Tik Tock type [ __ ] which I can't wait till they get rid of Tik Tok man I
(1:00) need get I need to get a ticktock death counter because that needs to go I'm
(1:06) sorry need to go let somebody else come up with the platform ticker in the back has done oh
(1:12) man I gotta find it bro help me find it Instagram has the same function now
(1:18) you don't need to get rid of Tik Tok because I mean even if you did you you still have uh you'd still have Instagram
(1:23) reals you know and then like you're gonna find more and more I want to get rid of Tik
(1:28) Tok sorry I just don't want the people I trained to kill on the battlefield to
(1:34) take all of this free Intel from Tik Tok because once you agree their terms of service they get into everything they
(1:40) know where you shop they know where you buy your ammo they know what classes you've had you know I'm sorry I'm not
(1:47) look gotta get the CCP up out of our business y'all that's how that's that's my whole thing do you trust our
(1:53) government more with that information I trust the Second Amendment
(1:58) more so if our government get too crazy I can go ahead and grab my M14 and go deal with it you know we get if it gets
(2:05) if it gets too out of pocket Americans would do what Americans have always done you know I don't know if you guys are
(2:10) familiar with the Battle of Athens in Tennessee 1946 if am familiar with the Battle of Athens I
(2:17) am Andrew welcome look up you this is not my podcast but I but I have but I
(2:23) have looked up the Battle of Athens so that was an isolated incident in a single town where the national
(2:30) uh was safeguarding the voting which they were within their rights to do they were just safeguarding the voting that's
(2:36) why they were able to kind of move through move through that without having um charges of treason against
(2:43) them it it wasn't to my understanding it wasn't a National Guard it was the guys who came home from the war had against a
(2:51) local they got their weapons from the National Guard May those guys Armory they took it from the National Guard
(2:57) Armory and they used those weap were naal guard they were the good guys well
(3:03) well technically I'm the National Guard once I got out you always you're always on defense ready like no these were
(3:09) these were these were not these were not irregular irregular they were regular irregular meaning that they were part of
(3:15) the army as the National Guards so they were regular Irregulars not irregular Irregulars so I understand what you're
(3:21) saying the distinction being everybody's a part of the militia even after they're out of the service I agree with that but
(3:27) what I'm saying to you is that these people were still in in the service just as a reserve component so they were
(3:32) getting paid by the US government to be in the service we're going to have to go and
(3:37) look that up again because the way I understand it from the from the articles that I read these were guys who came
(3:43) home from the war and they had to depose a local dictator and and it wasn't just that town it was it was it was a couple
(3:50) it was a couple outline no no it was the local it was a couple counties and this thing culminated and these soldiers
(3:57) Guardsmen whatever you want to call them I call them patriots and their weapons right their Thompson submachine guns
(4:03) their bars their their grants whatever they were able to get out that Armory and their ammo and the explosives right
(4:09) they took them out they took themo and they had to literally blow up the jail
(4:14) blow the doors off get in there and remove the bad guys who were trying to you know uh uh change the outcome of
(4:21) this particular election and I mean so my thing is because their job was to
(4:26) their job was to safeguard the election but this is an i isolated incident
(4:31) Americans don't actually usually do this at all in fact they almost never do this
(4:37) this is a very how become americ how do we how do we become Americans in the first place well uh essentially how do we
(4:44) become Americans well essentially because there was a grouping of people who were dissatisfied with paying
(4:50) remittances to England and so they were able to adopt a propagandist stance in
(4:56) order to push people against English taxation I get that and they got their guns and
(5:02) they fought the biggest baddest military on the planet and they got the help from the French from the French now here's the thing we don't want to hijack sister
(5:08) cat uh uh platform I would love to get into this I would because I got respect
(5:14) Let's Get Down well we can we can get into it on brother gr's platform your platform or whatever I mean get into it
(5:21) on platform right now why not now no time she has to make the
(5:30) it's her call I don't know if that's what she set out to do c we good perfect
(5:35) woman response she said she gave the green light so so what are you saying you're
(5:42) saying that Americans will not ra rise up if they get fed up is that what I'm hearing correct me if I'm wrong Andrew
(5:49) yeah that's what you're hearing all right cause can I give you
(5:54) can I give you my rationality behind it go ahead okay so here's my rationality behind it the American government
(6:01) essentially locked up the American public and while the American public was locked up they allowed cities to
(6:09) completely become overrun uh and Democrats allowed this by um making sure that law enforcement
(6:15) National Guard who were localized to protect those cities had to stand down and police departments were being burned
(6:22) to the ground and square entire square blocks of cities were being annexed by a
(6:29) what would consider a terrorist organization who then went on to consider them Sovereign areas meaning
(6:37) that um we've annexed this it's now ours and they considered themselves to not be part of the United States government any
(6:44) longer there was no push back really of any kind of any kind so no I think that
(6:51) as long as people have a full belly and they can go to work it's really hard to get them in what you would consider the
(6:58) Revolutionary spirit
(7:04) I hear where you coming from so I would agree with you and then I would I would add to that that
(7:10) okay coming soon Americans won't be able to get food will you think then they'll
(7:16) go out get their weapons and go hunt for food or go call for change or go remove those people who are getting fat on a
(7:21) hall why do you think that Americans aren't going to have access to
(7:27) food like what what signs have you seen for that because if if it's one thing I know about big fat ass Americans is that
(7:34) they have plenty of access to food and that doesn't seem like it's going away right in fact maybe it would be better
(7:41) if Americans had less access to food it was it was going to your point
(7:48) you was the argument you made the point was well as long as they are fat dumb and happy so to speak as long as they
(7:54) have food the argument I'm making okay take away the food what then yeah I get it but that's not going to happen this
(8:01) is your argument I understand this is your argument yeah that is my argument and part of the argument is because the
(8:07) descriptive is is that that's not going to happen there's that you're not going to take away uh the food supply of the
(8:13) United States where such a massive exporter of it um this is one of those
(8:18) those countries interestingly enough where if you were to go outside you right now sir if you were to take your
(8:24) camera and go outside and hold up a sign which said just this I'm not asking for
(8:30) any money whatsoever but I haven't eaten in two days you would probably have a meal delivered to you curbside in 20
(8:38) minutes by a Good Samaritan or I will get arrested for
(8:44) being a vagrant and lording that could happen as well but you're right one of the two Could Happen yeah I mean but
(8:49) even even the cops who came to arrest you if you told them that you were a veteran you're not asking for money they
(8:56) would probably buy you a meal you have a Lot Faith in people who
(9:03) they're veterans I mean there's some there's some good I live in Hillsboro County I got I'm real I like the Hillsboro County Sheriff Department I
(9:09) really do but hey man that's not always the case I was in LA for a very long
(9:15) time LAPD will put you on the street now you still get fed right you still get fed up to your point you're gonna get
(9:21) fed you live in a country where you you're still get fed you'll just
(9:26) be y but you're gonna get locked up my point is this there are enough Americans
(9:33) who when they get to that point wherever that point is when they get to that point like you know we were told the
(9:39) Boston Tea Party was the Catalyst and D but basically a bunch of American men
(9:44) who were British at the time got fed up they got tired of dealing with this silly ass King and they you know they
(9:50) were sitting around in the pubs drinking and like you know what we gotta do something about this [ __ ] and that will happen in America as well if we gets to
(9:57) that point and we're talking about a country where there are more Firearms there are more guns in this country than
(10:02) people so like the the folks out there doing whatever they doing who thinks for a moment that America won't lose their
(10:09) mind and just snap and grab their weapons and go do their thing I think they need to think that through I think it can happen well tell me tell me what
(10:16) that tell me tell me tell me what that takes because if it if it doesn't take
(10:23) it doesn't take a massive if it doesn't take a massive lockdown and people
(10:29) actually running and rioting in the streets destroying private property and
(10:35) your own political establishment setting aside room for them to do that against the civilian population what else could
(10:42) it take like short of what like what would it actually take for these men to
(10:48) go and get their guns and do this great overthrow that you're talking about it seems to me like
(10:55) um like their thresholds pretty pretty uh pretty large man
(11:00) it may be but again I just sit on the opposite side of that I think when people reach a point wherever that point
(11:06) may be and I you making a great point there like the the whole cough cough thing that was ridiculous that was that
(11:12) was ridiculous you know shutting down the economy locking people in and then turn around and paying those people for not going to work that was crazy but I'm
(11:20) pretty sure the the Nobles back in the day sitting in London was like ah this tax ain't going to make them mad let's
(11:26) do this that tax ain't goingon to make them mad let's take this land for them let's take that for them let's give them no representation they kept saying that
(11:34) bad way well this is a bad way to look at history what really happened in the Revolutionary War was that local
(11:41) magistrates who were government were actually fighting with another government that's what happened it was
(11:47) not the civilian population who just kind of were like oh let's grab our muskets and start shooting at these Red
(11:53) Coats it was localized governments who were fighting with a government which was thousands of miles away so they had
(12:00) these massive advantages but these were two governments fighting each other never get it twisted this was not
(12:06) organic it was propagandized and it was localized governments trying to motivate
(12:12) people locally to come and fight for them on the behalf of fighting against the British that was not organic at all
(12:20) it was it was propaganda based that's why the printing press was what they used more than anything and safeguarded
(12:26) more than anything because it was a propaganda war against the British it was not it it wasn't like a bunch of
(12:33) rednecks were just like man take on the [ __ ] government bastards and tired of them taxing me without all this
(12:39) represent that no nothing nothing like that ever happened well what about
(12:46) 2021 that wasn't organic either okay but I mean it's something was it organic
(12:52) though or was it or was it a massive op which in turn led to the tment of uh
(13:00) hundreds of Americans many of them without due process in order to F it out who the people who would do that would
(13:07) be and the operatives at the top levels were supposedly conservative leaders and
(13:13) interestingly enough they were able to walk away with no charges why their followers got tons of them it did not
(13:19) seem like any of that was organic to me as as an Irishman just as an outsider
(13:25) there ain't no way I'm believing that there's a group of thousand Americans that want to over over TR the government not one of those [ __ ] brought a
(13:32) gun none of them yeah boy that wasn't that wasn't an
(13:40) that wasn't an overthrow that was uh holding some signs and being really upset oh they were they were upsetti
(13:46) spaghetti what did that do nothing I tell I tell you this
(13:53) um that you know that absolutely was like call it what you want to call it
(14:00) that was a violent attempt to stop an American
(14:07) process right that's what that was where was the violence was any violence I mean I know people that were there I'll
(14:13) interject on this one I mean I know people that were there and it was not violent so breaking the windows and all
(14:19) that that wasn't violent smashing people up matter did that every day as an order
(14:24) black lives matter did it every day as an order of operation about black lives matter bro just long before black lives
(14:30) matter man just life in the hood every day is violent just for someone to
(14:35) sit that goes to my point that goes to my point not to yours just because life every day for this uh um group of people
(14:43) is violent has nothing to do with the overthrow of the US government one and then two if we were to dive into the you
(14:50) know what happened on the six um these people were not armed and they basically
(14:56) held signs and stood outside of this and were let in these were not a a group of
(15:01) marauders who came in in a battleship uh in order to conduct Warfare that was not
(15:06) that was not what happened and just in the interest of accuracy the people that broke the
(15:12) windows were not the ones holding the signs that's on video and accuracy
(15:18) matters so where is this where is this Elite fighting you guys hold
(15:24) on elite elite fighting force he said Elite fighting for yeah well I mean I'm
(15:31) I'm obviously I'm being factious right but yeah you are being fous like like I
(15:36) said and I'm I'm I'mma I'm I'mma Be Cool because we have mutual people that we know you know what I'm saying like
(15:41) you've been down in Mii Miami you been on their platform you just tell me what your opinion is let's duke it
(15:49) out and you have your my opinion is this right the people who did what they did
(15:57) that day a lot of them are locked up right now right they didn't get locked up for nothing right they actually they
(16:03) did some things they got locked up for right my thing is hey if you can't do the time don't do the crime and then
(16:09) while I was going on I moved to Central Florida this used to be a hug for old boy I mean bro you'll be hard pressed to
(16:15) find any outwardly like just really vocal supporters out here right now and I would ask people like well how come
(16:21) y'all out here with y' out flags and like every Friday it'll be on certain corners and how come y' ain't doing that
(16:27) anymore and they'll start telling about how so and so got locked up and the you know FBI came to see these people not the FBI but law enforcement came to see
(16:34) these people and these people had to come talk and they had list and all that and they like you
(16:40) know that actually goes Andrew's point so it's just like it's just oh go ahead you you just you just
(16:47) reinforced Andrew's Point those people were nonviolent and they got arrested
(16:53) anyway there's people had their entire bank accounts because they were in the vicinity bought
(16:59) a friend of mine who's in FFL in Missouri was harassed by the FBI his
(17:04) business was shut down for six months which basically caused him to almost go out of business he was locked up for 30
(17:12) days with no Bail no nothing just locked up while they evaluated the
(17:20) situation the FBI didn't let they eventually let him go because he didn't
(17:26) do anything but even the people they did lock up they have no proof of any kind
(17:31) that they did anything except walk around the however the cop that shot a
(17:37) woman walked free I can't I I don't you know and yeah
(17:44) you mean about Ashley babbit yes yeah so here I mean but but but this is the
(17:50) thing right is that there was no Insurrection it's completely and totally
(17:55) fabricated there was no Insurrection that's not what an Insurrection looks like if you look back at the historical
(18:00) record what insurrections look like you want to see an Insurrection go see what happened to Zar Nicholas and his family
(18:07) when the Communist conducted an Insurrection that's what it looks like what it doesn't look like is a bunch of people ass SS who get led into the
(18:13) palace that's not an Insurrection there something completely different well maybe they should have
(18:19) just did it like the Black Panthers did in California just brought their weapons and walked in there totally complying with the law that's not an
(18:26) Insurrection no was an Insurrection that's not what an Insurrection looks like either so I agree with you that
(18:33) blackan not cond I agree with you that the Black Panthers were not conducting an Insurrection but uh also I don't
(18:40) think that the people who were there that day were conducting an Insurrection I don't think that that's what that was
(18:45) it does not fit the categories that I would consider an Insurrection to
(18:52) be oh well you know unfortunately for those P people that the laws in America
(18:58) do and they they they had to do some time now I agre who who's been
(19:03) prosecuted for Insurrection successfully so far there are people who are locked up
(19:11) right now this has been going on as long as I've been alive like you saying I got a friend got you know he was in there
(19:16) for 30 days or whatever and they finally let him go because he ain't do nothing I know people have been locked down for five years it didn't do a thing it was
(19:23) locked up for five years right because they because they refused to take a way
(19:28) system is messed up so it's I get you and that's my point too I know people locked down right now like
(19:34) they charge you with you can't even pull them up in the system because they never got charged with anything right the system is messed up now this is going to
(19:39) splin into a whole bunch of you know other nuances within this within this conversation right and again it's like
(19:46) at some point people are going to be like all right that's it what is g to be that point yeah I don't know that's my
(19:54) question point I'm not sure that there's G to be that point and the reason is is
(20:00) because I think that inside of Nations where the people are wellfed and they
(20:07) have access to at least you know the majority of of whatever the social
(20:12) services are they're not going to do what it is that you're talking about that's what I think I can't find a
(20:20) modern example of the general population anywhere in the world who is wellfed and
(20:28) has access to basic Social Services who does that I I can't find an example anywhere I've
(20:35) looked so and my point is I'm okay I'm with you I'm with you all the way up until this point and then it goes to the
(20:42) question that I posed before what happens then when they can't get food
(20:47) what happens then when they don't the same thing that would happen in any Nation where people didn't have access
(20:53) to basic social services or food then at that point they do begin uh to give push
(20:58) back but you're talking about conditionals which are set where the government's not fulfilling its basic
(21:04) roles inside of society and that is not what's occurring right now in fact I would say they're they're fulfilling
(21:11) they're fulfilling too many roles in society right I agree with you there we're on the same page my question is my
(21:18) question is if we get to that point and like you said well it's definitely going to be a problem there right oh if the
(21:24) government they've overreached now they can't you know they they can't Quail the mass they can't feed the poor and there
(21:30) you know the people are getting tired of being picked up and locked up without you know any resemblance of our laws
(21:37) like man you just can't lock me up for nothing and they get to that point is that the point then that they pick up all them guns because we still have more
(21:43) guns than people in this in this country so when we get to that point what you're what you're asking right but what you're
(21:49) asking me really if you look at it from a logical sense you're saying well what happens if we get to the point where the
(21:54) conditionals are such that there is a revolution and it's like well then I guess we're at the point where the conditionals are such that we're at a
(22:00) revolution but um even even if I if I just kind of logically state that yeah
(22:06) that's a trism it's like asking um you know what happens uh if you come to the
(22:11) conditionals which would make you step out in your marriage then I would have to admit that you would meet the conditionals that would make you step
(22:17) out of your marriage it just ultimately has no bearing on the point which is whatever those conditionals are we're
(22:23) clearly not [ __ ] there and I'm not sure we'll ever get there it seems like it's a difficult thing to push the
(22:30) public towards any sort of social Revolution if they're
(22:36) fed and I agree with you and my thing is if that changes we got a serious problem I mean I'm just being 100 with you if
(22:43) that changes we got a problem and my thing is the problem is you know we do have a lot of weapons in this country
(22:49) and I'm glad we do you know because unlike most countries if people get there in
(22:55) America they can make a lot of noise as opposed to you name the they can't make as much noise they don't
(23:00) have what we have so I'm with you bro but I'm just saying I don't you're saying it's never going to happen I'm
(23:06) saying it may you know I mean that's that's where we I think that's where the difference is right now gonna Happ it's never gonna happen no that's not my
(23:13) point my point is you're saying is it is it is it go ahead my my point is just that
(23:20) these conditionals we don't seem like we're anywhere near whatever these conditionals are that's my point right whatever they
(23:27) are especially the food we got tons of food we got all yeah whatever they are I mean there in fact
(23:33) let me ask you a question if your neighbor came over to you tomorrow your neighbor and said hey man we're having a
(23:38) rough time at home right now uh you know you think he could help us out with some food wouldn't you go buy him some
(23:46) food of course and don't my neighbor of course it's super it's actually super
(23:53) hard to go hungry inside of the United States because I think that you can just knock on random people doors and tell
(23:59) them you're hungry and they'd probably feed you like not even lying I think that you can just knock I you know what
(24:05) I would be willing to do this I'd be willing to get make this experiment I would do it just for the fun of it uh I
(24:11) would say that one in five people's door you knocked on if you just knocked on the door and said listen uh I'm really
(24:18) sorry to disturb you I haven't eaten anything in a couple of days and I'm actually starving I was just wondering
(24:24) if you could spare a little bit of food I don't want any money or anything like that I bet you most people would give you something to
(24:30) eat and the I agree with you please people in theory I agree with you but people don't after there listening to us
(24:37) don't go around and start knocking on doors please don't um it depends on what doors you knocking on it could be a
(24:42) problem please don't but I get I think even in the ghetto I think even in the ghetto if you knocked on the door in the
(24:49) ghetto and said look I haven't eaten in a couple days you think you can you can help me out with something to eat I think even there a lot of people would
(24:56) be like yeah sure here's something to eat that's where I disagree with you knocking on the door part yeah knocking
(25:02) on the door part it's it's a diff the now you're talking about a way different world bro like it's it's just that's a
(25:07) different reality the knocking on the door part is not gonna get you fed now if you just in the hood and they
(25:14) recognize you and they see you trying to do well hey man can you help me yet I'll give you half your sandwich or whatever because you're talking about folks who
(25:19) don't have much to begin with and then you're talking about folks no no I get it but I still I still think what I'm
(25:24) saying I guess my overarching point here though is that I think most people they
(25:30) see somebody who's legitimately hungry who doesn't have enough food to eat they're actually hungry because they
(25:35) haven't eaten I think most people in this country will feed them they will and and and and I'm not a
(25:42) religious person I in fact I am your friendly neighborhood Heathen when it comes to religion but I would say that
(25:48) most people in American want to be the Good Samaritan most people want to be like even even even when I come across
(25:56) folks all right but let's food for for a minute what about housing
(26:01) what about when in about it what about instead of 20110 you start seeing 200 tents and entire cities become tent
(26:08) cities uh what's the limit to that when does that end I mean if you're talking
(26:14) about a homelessness crisis then you would be talking about some some kind of mass event which would cause large
(26:20) sections of the population become bankrupt even though they're able-bodied again this seems very
(26:26) far-fetched to me at least in the current environment don't you see more these days than before yeah the people
(26:32) that you see in tent cities generally are mentally ill to be perfectly honest with you sir they're not there because
(26:37) they're able-bodied and are trying to do everything that's right but just can't they're usually there because they're
(26:43) mentally ill they're not there because um because they're like you and I they're there because they have screws
(26:49) loose upstairs there there may be circumstances where people who are not mentally ill and have all of their
(26:56) faculties and are just good decent people fall on you know horrific times and end up in a tense City but that's
(27:02) going to end up being something which is very isolated it's going to be an outlier and they're usually going to
(27:08) work themselves out of it very quickly because the truth is is that and this and this is not if you end up in a job
(27:14) let's say you end up on a construction crew um you go to them and you say look I'm homeless I don't I don't even have a
(27:21) place to live this and that you'd be surprised how many people will put you up as you work there's always a need for
(27:27) work and the thing is is that most people who don't have a job it's very clear to me
(27:33) at this point don't [ __ ] want a job because man there's nothing but jobs so
(27:39) then the increase intense in on the streets the in the the growth of these tense cities is
(27:45) proportional to the growth in mental illness of course yeah not only is that statistically true but I can give you a
(27:52) great example of this and I'm sure uh Mr Saint will probably back me up a lot of
(27:57) the um modern homeless crisis comes from veterans who are mentally ill from
(28:03) untreated PTSD and they can't get the help that they need they can't get the group help that they need they can't get
(28:09) access to the resources that they need and a lot of times when you're talking about homeless veterans you're talking
(28:15) about people who are in these tense cities is because they suffer from severe mental illness or drug addiction I would add to
(28:21) that bro like well that that's often that often moves into many other cases though there's fenel and there's there
(28:28) 15y old kids on fenel there are so many different cases I think yeah but the 15-year-old kids on feny aren't living
(28:33) in tent cities dude well plenty of people who are older than that not all of them I don't think it's just mental
(28:40) just m yeah and I would I you're saying wait you're saying that
(28:47) the economic of people who are completely Shane and have a work ethic are ending
(28:53) up homeless intent cities I reject that categorically I don't believe you I don't believe that that's the case
(28:58) I don't believe that that's the matter well let there before you
(29:05) answer maybe when the econom is good these people are on the borderline and they're okay they they can make it you
(29:11) know they can get by but then you put a little more pressure on them they go over to the other side so it is related
(29:18) to the economy I mean I I just I mean it's obvious it's related to the economy it does not seem so obvious to me that
(29:28) the richest and one of the richest Nations on planet Earth that able-bodied sane men able-bodied meaning they can
(29:35) work sayane meaning they're mentally stable and they're willing to work end
(29:40) up in tent cities that is not a thing which I think is true I think it's a
(29:46) it's a case use of people who are mentally ill or drug addicts which if you're a drug addict I think that you're
(29:52) at least in at that point in your life experiencing mental illness so there's the try to back to
(29:58) the feminist as well cuz like I said it kind of went into the was it like basic Revolution talk uh what happens though
(30:05) like when if if feminism keeps getting stronger and stronger and stronger and we get to a stage where there's so much men that are like [ __ ] this we want the
(30:12) because like no matter how much money I earn or whatever it's it's going to be the top 10% or think of men so basically all the women just attract to them
(30:18) hypergamy takes over and then all these sexist men basically get angry and then
(30:24) they say [ __ ] this let's turn the tables bro there a lot of lay there's a lot of
(30:29) layers to both these topics man so to to to brother T's question right here with hypergamy and you know feminist women
(30:36) and all that the guys on the streets right the guys at the top tier and all the way
(30:42) down those those are the dudes that fuel what's going on we keep talking about this feminist thing right if these guys
(30:49) will buckle down do the work learn themselves a little bit of game and what I mean by game is Just understanding just kind of learn how the thing works
(30:56) learn how to get into a woman's ear C sister cat said it earlier in this stream when it comes to uh to questions
(31:02) of the heart things of the heart relationships and all that man women are suckers for for the yokey dop you can
(31:07) they'll believe them anything you tell them right so if if dudes stop accepting this bad behavior the shit'll go away
(31:14) you're starting to see it happen now here in America anyway you're starting to see it women want attention and it's
(31:19) bad attention now to the wom if women would stop their bad behavior go away
(31:26) too say again I missed that say if women stopped their bad behavior it would go away
(31:33) too right but but my point again this is very tier there's a bunch of ways to to fix this right but that the women want a
(31:41) certain type of dude right and all All These Guys these young guys come to me like man I have no I have no shot I
(31:47) don't have any money I'm under six feet um I don't go to the gym all these I live with my mom they come up with all these excuses and I'm like bro like you
(31:54) I'm in my 50s when I was in my 20s I was broke right just I was still living with
(32:00) my in my parents house for a little bit trying to get a place I have no money but that's when I was at my height when it came to the whole womanizing thing I
(32:06) had women everywhere I had women who would take me places that would buy me [ __ ] it was just it is what it is how did I get those women well I knew how to
(32:13) talk you probably have a sense apprach yeah but you probably have a sense of Charisma Charisma is not a thing
(32:19) Charisma yeah but Charisma is not a thing you can teach you can't teach it but confidence
(32:25) you know confidence is enough even without the Charisma confidence enough to get you into play you never not had
(32:34) Charisma I'm talking about where are all these men with no Charisma bagging all these broads I've never seen them I've
(32:41) seen men with confidence who have Charisma what about rich so like my man
(32:48) fresh they don't they get rich they don't need the Charisma they get they can afford to to provide exp Walter has
(32:54) tons of Charisma have you ever seen him talking with people even off camera
(33:00) tons I've been with I've been in the trenches I've been in the trenches with Walt I've been in the trenches with Walt
(33:05) right I'm I'm just saying the way he runs his game he's one of those he's one
(33:11) of those solid quiet dudes but when you just looking at me from the outside in you don't know that you got to sit there
(33:16) and watching mov it's like oh CRA yeah but at what what level of Charisma does it take do I have to be as smooth as
(33:22) James Bond No I could just be as smooth as W he's if if I'm just making up let's
(33:28) start with D okay well let's do it like this then we'll say was like Dungeons and Dragons rules right Charisma the
(33:34) Charisma stat you know you know I never play the Charisma stat the Charisma stat
(33:39) needs to be at least at a four okay it needs to be at least at a four out of 10 let's say 10's the highest say one and a
(33:46) half I say one and a half we all these guys with a one and a half can you I'll
(33:52) tell you what I'll make a deal with you I'll buy you a pizza because it's The Crucible piz party hang hang on hang on
(33:57) let me finish finishing on I'll buy you pizza right now during The Crucible pizza party if you can point to one
(34:02) person that we can look to who's one of these big game pimping dudes who has a
(34:08) Charisma of one and a half oh just one just name one just hang on
(34:16) just one well the the people I name you don't
(34:21) know so it's hard for me to do that the Pua
(34:27) I give me some time to think about that I have to sit around and think who y'all might know but here's here's because
(34:33) here's my thing what is the Miss when when we had these conversations I got I
(34:38) ask guys all the time when we have these conversation what is the mission for the dude what what what is their barrier of success in most cases it's sex right
(34:46) that's what most of these dudes these bottom 80 Guys these guys out there in the manal swamp they're trying to get
(34:51) sexual access right for anyone who's in the game they know that's a low bar and that's why I'm saying a one one a half
(34:58) on a Charisma scale is enough to get you that sex from a woman not even and these
(35:05) dudes AR go ahead well I just want to make sure I want to Steelman this properly make sure I get what you're
(35:10) saying correctly you're saying that if the bar is set at just getting sex from women your charisma can be low are you
(35:17) taking out from that the pay forplay aspect yes I am I don't consider that
(35:22) that doesn't count well then I don't believe you I don't believe that there's a bunch of men out there or any really
(35:28) anywhere who has a very low Charisma stat on the D and D scale who's pulling
(35:34) in a bunch of chicks absent having some sort of resources to pay for them in
(35:40) some capacity I just don't but when we say pay for we when we
(35:45) say pay for play yeah or do you talking about hey I'm gonna give you this much money so you can give me sex that's what
(35:53) I I'm not saying PR I'm not saying PR
(35:59) yeah prostitution directly what I'm saying is that um they have the
(36:04) resources push yeah which they can push towards women I think absent that though
(36:09) because that's still pay for play essentially it's still a pay for play name for p okay I gotta guy want a
(36:17) name for pizza I got a guy w a name and I don't know this man I never met this man just based on what I've seen somebody we're going to know though
(36:23) right uh hell yeah you been you on this podcast all the time your man uh was it Brian from whatever he doesn't seem like
(36:29) a guy who has a lot of Charisma to me he seems like a very smart guy got never met tons of he's got never met tons of
(36:39) [ __ ] but you get but you get my point I've nope that's not a good one because
(36:45) that guy has that guy has a ton of Charisma in fact he not only attracts
(36:51) women to him but he attracts men to him so that's the sign of somebody who's a charismatic is that men will follow him
(36:58) and women desire him and that is something which Brian doop him now yeah
(37:04) go ahead if we could drop if we can drop him let's say remove the fame remove the
(37:10) platforms remove all that stuff and let's take him somewhere I don't know Poland right or it have to be an English
(37:16) speaking country I it's take them somewhere where they speak English you know I don't want say Poland although most of them speak English drop him
(37:23) somewhere let's drop him somewhere in fly over country there's there you go let's drop him somewhere in America fly of a country well not let just F of a
(37:30) country let's drop him somewhere in the dtas or let's drop him somewhere in in Montana or Oklahoma or something like that let's drop him there you're telling
(37:37) me because what I'm saying is I think his Charisma level is real low I think his Charisma level is about a one and a
(37:43) half right maybe two based on that's what I'm saying but I what just the way he carries himself only what I see
(37:50) because I haven't met oh go ahead G give me one minute so I hate to do this to
(37:55) you bro but Brian's original career started out doing prank videos and one
(38:01) of the pranks he did was walking around in cities he had never been in nobody knew who he was and he would ask women
(38:08) for sex and he would ask like a hundred and he' get one or two but that's a dude
(38:14) cold calling and he had enough Riz that a couple of women said yeah I'll go bang
(38:20) you right now off the street happily happily that's game bro got that sneaky
(38:27) Charis yeah that's run that's that's game I give you that that's Charisma I give you
(38:32) that that's running numbers right right but I know dudes who do it without cameras and just whatever like so the
(38:38) argument would be if he had Charisma let's say he was on that Charisma scale of a eight eight and a half that instead
(38:43) of get one or two that number would be eight or nine right I'm just saying so I just don't
(38:48) think that much Charisma it's not one and a half for
(38:54) sure give one and a half just to clarify like when you say like someone well I'll tell you what then well I mean let's see
(39:00) if you just went out and asked random broads to bang you like what would your success rate be based on your
(39:08) charisma I would say it'll be probably right around where he was well it depends on where I am your Christmas one
(39:14) and a half I think I no no I'm saying I think that I think that in Miami because
(39:21) that's one of the cities that I think you can really do well in I I think I would probably get out of a 100 maybe
(39:27) three four maybe that's probably about what his success rate was brotheri brother Tariq wanted to say
(39:33) something no just to clarify shut up you stupid Irishman we're having a conversation shut the [ __ ] up you
(39:40) [ __ ] loser a piece of [ __ ] get the [ __ ] out of we're in the middle of having a cono and you wreck the whole
(39:47) thing by way by the way terak terak can I buy a pizza dur The Crucible pizza
(39:53) party can you hop in the Discord real quick get a hold of Mr E and we're going to get you Pizza on The Crucible today
(39:59) sir you're a g you're a gentle shut up you piece of [ __ ] don't ever tell me I'm I hate you you're
(40:04) [Laughter] scum but yeah just to just to clarify
(40:09) like when you say Charisma of one I'm thinking of like like someone with autism totally here I'm thinking of somebody who's like sitting there in a
(40:15) corner going they're like these are people I'm not thinking
(40:21) that really well all the guys I really I I really believe in that 8020 rule right
(40:27) so I think any guy who can get sexual access for a woman is in the top 20% off rip that's just where I come from with
(40:33) it like if you can get access from a woman you can walk up to a woman and just have a conversation you're in the top 20 so of the guys in the top 20 I
(40:41) was and that's where my Charisma scales begin I'm not going to rap the dudes in the bottom eight they don't know what they're doing the rest of them are in
(40:46) the corner you know I mean picking boogers and going they don't wa hang on hang on hang on okay this is kind of
(40:52) like a red herring then you're saying well the thing is is that I assign a Charisma of one only to the most
(41:00) charismatic men who are already way above a one by your own metric right if you're talking about the population at
(41:06) large what would you assign a Charisma of one [Music]
(41:13) as wouldn't that be like I just count BL bubbles next to
(41:18) blish pretty much I mean yeah you'd be blowing bubes right they're like the invisible
(41:25) guys are just that invisible like these guys they don't even count man I mean it's kind of like
(41:31) when you play sports bro you Ain make the team you're nothing and when you do make the team you ain't starting you ain't [ __ ] I mean I'm looking at it like
(41:37) that like of the guys who actually are out there doing it right yeah to me for
(41:42) me to even talk about you means you already you a dude you're one of the dudes but let me go ahead and give you
(41:47) that rating like I don't think you know like like a 10 who's a 10 those would be the guys who are like the the real pimps
(41:53) out there who are actually talking women and men into doing stuff just by talking to him that's such a rare human being
(42:00) it's insane that's to me like that those are the 10 and the guys below those the the player guys the guys who really
(42:05) mastered their game and I guess kids call it Riz now whatever the hell that means but those guys I mean it's hard to
(42:11) get for it's really hard to get up there so what was the bad is that what that means is that yeah I I think it's just
(42:17) short for Charisma what was the bad behavior is that what that is short for Charisma
(42:23) yeah the bad behavior me no no uh Andrew was talking about bad behavior when
(42:29) women cut um when they stopped with their bad behavior going way back well I so women
(42:35) yeah yeah so I can I can we talking about feminism yeah yeah so what I'm saying is that women are The Gatekeepers
(42:42) of sex they're the deciders of reproduction not men my demonstration
(42:48) for this for how I can prove that this is true is because you have twice as
(42:54) many uh female ancestors as you do male ancestors this means that most men at
(43:00) least 50% were not able to successfully reproduce but almost all women were so
(43:08) this means that women are going to be The Gatekeepers so they decide who whose seed they take and whose seed they do
(43:14) not because they are the womb whereas men are far less discriminate so it used to be even in this nation just 90 years
(43:22) ago that women were far more discriminate about who seed they took in and when we had a uh kind of top tier
(43:30) down push towards monogamy they would obviously go for the best that they
(43:35) could um just like men would but they were definitely always The Gatekeepers
(43:41) of who got to reproduce and who does not get to reproduce men are not The
(43:46) Gatekeepers of that well that that's exactly well that's more or less what I said before you came on but what's bad
(43:53) about their behavior now uh well right now you have a
(43:59) barricade between sex and reproduction and this was done uh via the sexual
(44:05) Revolution so now birth control mechanisms like abortion uh or regular birth control or plan b or the abortion
(44:12) pill things like this allow them to have that uh unfettered access to sex like
(44:18) men without any of the reproductive consequences whereas before they had to
(44:23) deal with the reproductive consequences so they're much more selective about the men they had sex with which was
(44:29) basically nobody because their Chastity intact would give them access to a much higher tier of mate that is no longer
(44:36) the case however if The Sisterhood decided tomorrow that they would only
(44:41) move towards um monogamous relationships and uh not have sex because they don't
(44:47) have to deal with the reproductive ramifications of that the entire the you know this this entire thing that we're
(44:54) talking about between men and women in sex selection would be over with
(45:02) overnight maybe I mean how's that a maybe I'd actually like to hear a
(45:08) counterargument to it uh I think there are other things keeping it in place you know it's it's
(45:14) any anytime you have a difference uh people can exploit that to create division you know like you just need to
(45:22) whisper in someone's ear yeah he this guy said something about you and just this just the fact you're different will be enough to kind of keep it
(45:29) going what and and there are reasons to keep it going you know what the hell are you talking about I I don't even know
(45:35) what you're talking about divide and conquer you know divide and conquer uh if you want to keep people divided you
(45:41) just pick two groups that are different on it could be anything you could pick brown-haired people and blue you know
(45:47) blond groups are different there's an objective there is an objective truth of the matter you do agree that men and
(45:54) women are not interchangeable widgets and that we ontologically different right right but I'm saying so when you
(46:00) offer incentives to the general population if you yourself understand there's an ontological meaning a a mode
(46:07) of being which is different between men and women why wouldn't you offer different incentives to men than you do
(46:13) women that seems wise oh I'm not I'm not arguing against that I'm just
(46:19) saying even if we could fix the bad behavior if if you find that desirable
(46:24) which I I don't necessarily desirable to fix the bad behavior of women I don't
(46:30) see it as bad I think that's sub you think promiscuous women is are good sorry you think promiscuous promiscuity
(46:37) in women is good it's good it's if they're happy with it if they do it willingly then it must be good for them
(46:44) I mean who am I to choose ah thank God you're for you Nick so Nick what you're
(46:51) saying is you're a cummer right I am not familiar with that term uh you're a what
(46:57) what we would consider what we would consider a sexual deviant your morality
(47:02) when it comes to sex is that more of it is preferable than less of it and the
(47:07) more people who want to have it well quite frankly Andrew it's just none of your concern uh no no I just think uh whoever
(47:16) wants to have sex should have sex and whoever doesn't that's what I just said right so so but I'm not deciding no no
(47:24) listen I'm not deciding for a society you know uh at large let's say you could
(47:30) let's assume you could yeah but let's assume that you could I wouldn't so even
(47:35) if you could so even if you could if you still wouldn't then you are deciding no yeah I'm deciding for myself
(47:42) I decide for myself well no no no hang on hang on if you are ultimate dictator Nick you're in charge of all of society
(47:51) and you say people can be just as promiscuous as they want to be I still would take no different position then
(47:58) here as the decider you're saying that this is a moral a it's it's actually an imperative that people be able to be
(48:04) allowed to be promiscuous if they so choose to be that is the entailment of that thought process Nick it wouldn't
(48:11) matter it wouldn't matter because people would always end up finding a new kind of morality no oh well then why make
(48:16) murder laws Nick after all people will just always find a way to murder why have laws against murder Nick that makes
(48:22) no sense right like War for example people yeah I mean why why yeah why have lot Nick why have a lot of anything if
(48:30) people will just find a way to skirt it that's a good question because I mean the only thing that keeps laws in place
(48:36) is that most people follow them most people obey them so they must be good
(48:41) enough because if they weren't good enough most people would break them and when most people break them you might as well like just take it out of the law
(48:47) books so so just just so I got this right you don't think that a law against
(48:53) murder deters murderers we do we still have murder do we have
(48:59) less murder than we did when the deterrence were less strong towards murder I don't know well the answer is
(49:06) yes murder has been doing here's what here's what Mur well we have stats right you can pull them up right now while I'm
(49:12) talking to you that's hearsay it's hearsay do now Nick I just want to make sure I got this right you don't think
(49:19) that we can track the number of human beings who have been killed absent justification inside of this nation I
(49:26) just want to make sure you were talking about the past if we were to go back 500 years we don't need
(49:32) bro why do we need to go back 500 years in total red hairing you talking no no it's a total red herring I'm talking
(49:37) about right now right this second or do you agree that oh let's just say in the
(49:43) 90s the murder rates were higher than they are right now okay that's that's easier to do we
(49:50) can compare the 90s to now but I can't talk about pre-law you know we weren't talking about pre-law total red hearing
(49:57) brother brother brother Nick if I could jump in real quick no I was I wasn't hang on let us finish let us finish
(50:02) we're almost done I'm just real quick if I can get away with Mur if I I have to if I could get away
(50:09) with murder bro it would be a lot of people in body bags right now bro it's the law that keeps me from doing it
(50:14) right just keeping it 100 bro I mean I gotta just I gotta make that point it is a deterrent it is a deterrent so Nick um
(50:22) so Nick I guess the point we're getting at is it's a lot hold on hear me out though law that exists because most
(50:28) people think it's a good La that's what I'm trying that's the point I'm trying to make it out of the law books we would
(50:34) we would come back to it we would gravitate back well gez Nick that's really weird because most people most
(50:40) people don't like the lobbyist laws so how come we still have the lobbyist laws I don't see how that's relevant
(50:48) wait wait I wait Nick now you just got done saying the only reason we have laws is because most people like them that's
(50:54) why we have them and yet I can give give you many examples of laws most people don't like and yet we still have those
(51:00) laws it's really weird Nick the the laws that people actually
(51:06) end up obeying I think have to be good enough they have to be good enough
(51:11) otherwise yeah they stay in the law books but nobody like there's no penalty
(51:16) you know like nobody really gets in trouble but that's to my point not to your point on the sidewalk it's illegal
(51:22) to spit apparently to spit on the sidewalk in Florida but nobody cares because nobody gets penalized for it gets arrested for
(51:28) it so hang on so what you're saying is that if people got penalized for it that less people would do
(51:35) it uh no people would no they wouldn't no because the police all that I don't
(51:41) understand I thought you just got that saying most people don't spit on the sidewalk in Florida because if they do they're not penalized for it and that's
(51:48) why they do it but but now you're saying okay go ahead Nick let me finish okay so there's a law in Florida against
(51:54) spitting on the sidewalk right nobody enforces this law because they realize how absurd it would be to try to enforce
(52:01) it so everyone spits freely everyone spits on the sidewalk freely if they want to now if you were to decide to try
(52:07) to enforce that law like seriously I think the police would be the first to
(52:13) say yeah no let's let's not let's not oh you do huh so do you think that most
(52:18) people in the United States are for or against the tax laws on some level there must they must
(52:25) be for it oh you think that they're for it they love it they love having Uncle Sam come
(52:30) and take their money onethird of their paycheck every time they get paid they they love that Nick it's their favorite
(52:36) well if you were to turn it to 78 or 80% you you'd get a different answer also
(52:42) let me get this right so so hang on so they don't want any of it but because it's the law they pay it even though
(52:49) they don't like the law they very clearly don't like the law you're saying they must at some level actually like
(52:55) the law because otherwise wouldn't do it no no no they don't like would that would that like be the equ the equation
(53:01) with like Aztec human sacrifice Nick they just sacrificed humans because that's what people they liked it right
(53:07) they liked it that was the thing they loved it I think you're digressing a bit but I look I think people must consider
(53:14) it's not an digression it's an argument they must consider it just to some extent otherwise they wouldn't pay they
(53:20) just wouldn't pay they wouldn't so so to get this right all morality is
(53:27) intuitive no not all moral morality well I mean no no hang on Nick Nick I can
(53:33) explain how that has to be an inment because what you're saying is is that the intuition of people is what makes
(53:40) the law since the intuition of people is what makes the law no what well what makes the law it's a collective
(53:47) phenomenon it's like so the intuition of people in the south of Italy it's a good thing hang on hang on hang on how do you
(53:53) come up with the collective of people want X if it's not based on their intuition I'll explain so the south of
(53:59) Bley the south of Bley right they have tax laws but but everyone finds a way around them they find very clever ways
(54:05) around them so they come up with new laws so people find clever ways around the new laws and in the end people still
(54:12) don't pay taxes why because there's this Collective will there's this cultural
(54:17) phenomenon that just takes place and nobody pays taxes and that's just the way it is yeah I mean they do but they
(54:23) do pay taxes Nick yeah obviously we do fewer taxes than they do in the north yeah okay but they but they pay their
(54:29) taxes because that's the law right only the taxes that they're forced so now so now Nick so now Nick we can figure this
(54:35) out right now we can figure this out right now assuming there was no laws
(54:40) anywhere in southern Italy that anybody ever had to pay taxes right right ever
(54:47) right versus there are laws that people do have to pay taxes under which system do you think people would pay more taxes
(54:57) they would find they would pay the no Nick answer my question Nick I'm answering your question they pay no it's
(55:03) just I just want to know if we had a a nation so I just I just want to I just want you to tell me which system the
(55:10) system where there's no law that you have to pay taxes versus a system where you have a law that says you have to pay taxes which system are people paying
(55:18) more taxes going forward I'm trying to explain okay so they would end up gonna explain it they could possibly pay more
(55:24) taxes just a different type of tax to a different entity they pay the pizo to the mafia they'd end up having to pay
(55:30) someone because we gravitate towards these structures anyway it's like if you were to try to implement uh you know if
(55:37) you wanted to go to resort to chaos and like uh Anarchy Anarchy would never La
(55:43) last for very long because we just so then back to my question my back to my question system says you have to pay no
(55:49) taxes system says you have to pay taxes which system do more people pay taxes under it depends on the people depends
(55:57) depends so you think that under the system where there's no taxes people are going to go and pay taxes yes because
(56:04) they have yes okay well that with that I'm going to go take a leak while you just understand your massive cognitive
(56:10) dissonance that you just said under system where no one has to pay taxes they're still gonna pay taxes you insane
(56:16) Bastard out if I just bro I just heard you out that's insane but you just said is absolutely okay go ahead all right
(56:23) I'm listening okay now no it depends on culture if you have a culture where people believe that they all need to
(56:29) pitch in together and it's important for these public areas to be well-kept then yeah they're all going to pay taxes
(56:36) they're going to pull together it's not going to be enforced by the government but they're going to find it you know
(56:41) morally correct to do it and they're going to do it of their own will okay whereas in another system where the
(56:47) cultures flawed but the government is trying to impose something it doesn't matter if the law is there in place it
(56:53) doesn't matter can you give me exle of an area sorry you give me an examp any example I
(57:00) don't care which one of such an area where people willingly take money out of
(57:06) their pocket to make a community yeah huh small small
(57:13) organizations you know haven't you ever been part of a I'm talking about I'm talking about people living in a
(57:20) community not a business that has a a means to to an end I'm talking about
(57:25) like my in my community here nobody pays
(57:32) anything because we don't want to there's no HOA we just do our own [ __ ]
(57:38) we all take care of our own yards down the road there's an HOA they find people
(57:43) if they don't pay money to keep the grounds clean yeah but
(57:49) that's yeah now are you talking about I I don't think you can give me an example of any but let me ask you a question
(57:55) about taxes because taxes are taxes have a special place in my heart so do you really so just you know
(58:03) in you know full transparency I pay I for the last roughly 10 years I have
(58:08) been very fortunate enough to pay over six figures in income tax every single [ __ ] year I mean let's uh we can we
(58:16) can actually simplify this real quick um given the choice do you think I would want to do
(58:22) that of course not of course not but you're okay then right right if if it
(58:27) wasn't under pain of law well hang on let me uh let me steal man Nick's position because I think I understand
(58:33) what he's saying Nick saying and Nick you uh you can correct me if I'm wrong I
(58:38) just want to Steelman this properly so I know I have a down pth you're saying absent a taxation system there'll be x
(58:46) amount of voluntarists who will still give money for x amount of things because they want the better Society
(58:51) whether it's infrastructure or this or that right depending on the culture let's just yeah sure sure I'm not
(58:58) talking about the world we live in now I understand I understand let's just say it's some um some you know more advanced
(59:04) culture or something like this okay right so then I want you to understand this entailment you tell me if this is true or false under this worldview if we
(59:12) have no laws against murder there'll be just as many murders as if we didn't
(59:17) have laws saying you could not
(59:23) murder if you could indoctrinate you take uh if we could conduct a controlled
(59:28) we could never do this but if we could somehow conduct a controlled experiment where you totally indoctrinated one
(59:34) group of children in one community and did the same in another the culture would be the most the most important
(59:42) factor that would dictate how the people behaved and what they did not some law
(59:47) like something written on on on you know in a book well okay then Nick then in
(59:53) this culture the one that we currently live in would there be more murder or
(59:59) less murder if he made murder legal tomorrow I would assume more murder you
(1:00:05) would assume more murder so then Nick would there be more prostitution or less prostitution if you made prostitution
(1:00:12) legal Tomorrow there's plenty of prostitution there there might be more prostitution
(1:00:18) now than there was before because if you consider only fans prostitution I mean or or sugar daddies since the internet
(1:00:25) we've I think we've seen we've seen a rise in prostitution let's just say hookers form of it a different women who
(1:00:31) get penetrated by men for money would there be more of them or less of them if you made a law saying that if you can
(1:00:36) get penetrated for money it's legal depend how many it depends on how easily
(1:00:41) you could get around the law the law says it's legal I'm sorry okay yeah so
(1:00:51) uh the answer is more brother it's no getting around it it's more okay yeah
(1:00:56) there's no getting around it brother I mean even I even if your point is they were already doing it for money breaking
(1:01:02) the law if you made IL legal it's gonna be more of them bro legally out there doing be the answer the answer to those
(1:01:08) question is more there's no getting around it bro to both killing that's the answer that's the answer to everything
(1:01:15) if we if you were to say that going 120 miles an hour down the highway was now
(1:01:20) legal right would more or less people do 120 miles an hour on the highway I do at
(1:01:26) least 90 to slow down but sure yeah would but the question is would more or less people do it I think it it still
(1:01:33) depends on the people it still depends yeah okay the United States the United
(1:01:38) States you made a law tomorrow you can do a 120 miles an hour on any Highway
(1:01:43) you're on would more people do 120 miles an hour on the highway or would less people do it of course in the US well
(1:01:50) then we have established that deterrence in law is effective so when I ask you
(1:01:56) Nick I say Nick what do you mean that you could not curtail female promiscuity
(1:02:01) through law you say you can't it can't be done you're clearly incorrect of course it can be done of course it can
(1:02:08) because all other forms of law the which we talk about where I say the incentive
(1:02:13) is either there or it is not you say I agree if thing X were legal more people
(1:02:18) would do thing X for instance right now let's assume that it's illegal to own a
(1:02:25) firearm if it was legal to own a firearm would more people own a firearm Nick or would less people own
(1:02:31) one uh obviously more people would own a firearm then Nick you have no argument bro I just walked you through your whole
(1:02:38) argument now you know bro I still find your argument a bit simplistic I think it's still simplistic it doesn't need
(1:02:44) why why does logic need to be complex using these extreme examples right these extreme it's not extreme they are there
(1:02:50) are countries right this second where you cannot own a gun true or false
(1:02:55) true yeah okay and then there's countries right now like this one where you can true or false look there's a
(1:03:01) country answer my question Nick true or false the answer Nick I'm almost done answer my question there are countries
(1:03:07) right now where you can own a gun correct yeah and there's countries right now where you can't right okay so how's
(1:03:15) that extreme it's literally mapping it on to reality no you don't no you're you're comparing guns owning guns to
(1:03:22) prostitution I feel that prostitution is already I mean there's so much of it I don't know if there would really be a
(1:03:28) difference if you were to make it legal tomorrow because there's anyway okay yeah there would be
(1:03:34) more obviously there'd be more but it would be I don't think it'd be very significant because the law isn't
(1:03:39) keeping keeping people from doing would there be okay let's assume that it just wouldn't be significant would there be
(1:03:44) more prostitution if it was illegal or less if you okay obviously there would
(1:03:49) be more but I mean is it really there would be more so then the question becomes the question becomes what do you
(1:03:55) want to see in society is a push towards in society with prescription of Law and governance if you want to see bad
(1:04:02) behavior from people then you would ascribe to the Nick philosophy of let them do whatever the [ __ ] they want
(1:04:08) because after all you can't mitigate it with law even though Nick also says you can mitigate all this with law so make
(1:04:13) it make sense Nick you totally no you're missing my point now you because you go to extremes and that's not what I'm
(1:04:19) trying to say being extreme you're not going to change you're not going to make any significant changes necessarily by
(1:04:25) changing the law that's what I'm trying to say if you write something down on paper that's not going to change the way
(1:04:30) people behave okay brother Nick brother Nick I really wait wait hang on hang on
(1:04:36) I just want to make sure I got this clear really you're saying that if you pass a law tomorrow it's not really
(1:04:43) Gonna Change very much what happens based on the law no let me oh you want
(1:04:49) to revise yeah go ahead and re revise that I would to okay now if you really want to make a change in culture if you
(1:04:56) want to make a change in the way women behave and the way couples work the law
(1:05:01) is probably not where you should begin you should begin with culture you should begin with education with Children what
(1:05:08) children are taught that's going to be are children taught based on prescription of
(1:05:13) law um yeah religious law you know social law they're not really oh I teach my
(1:05:21) daughter about the law bro I teach my daughter about the law just just real quick brother Nick brother Nick quick
(1:05:26) real quick brother Nick my daughter and her iPhone ran up a $10,000 bill after I
(1:05:33) calm down, yes sir after I calmed down how
(1:05:38) video games that the the the the goddamn just like uh slot machines it wasn't slot machine she was just playing some
(1:05:44) video game was like power up now it's a long story we had an adult I didn't have an iPhone at the time I was Android we
(1:05:49) had an adult that was the the the the go between between uh the her purchases and
(1:05:55) then we we changed the accounts and the adult came off and we weren't thinking so my daughter had un she had
(1:06:00) unfeathered access to the to the money and she ran up just you know you saw we saw it it was after the banks called me
(1:06:07) we saw how she did it a little bit here a little bit there that's all beyond the point the point is I had to explain the
(1:06:13) law behind that I said listen you're my daughter and I love you I can talk to you now it's been a week you know I mean
(1:06:19) so here's the thing if you had done this to anybody else you would go to prison because this is against the law you
(1:06:26) stole money that's what that was you know this isn't yours and you stole it
(1:06:32) that's the law I had to teach her that very teachable moment cost me a [ __ ] ton cost me a [ __ ] T I got 5,000 back but I
(1:06:39) was still out five grand right but it was the law that I was teaching her and I also got to teach her the law as to
(1:06:46) you know how it's going to affect her as she moves forward I'm a parent that's my responsibility so yeah you got to incor
(1:06:51) and if I was religious I would be talking about religious law be a Christian or Muslim or you know or Jew
(1:06:58) whatever whatever religion they all come with rules they all come with laws so you got to teach that bro I I mean I
(1:07:04) would if I were in charge I wouldn't choose to focus on changing laws if I really wanted to change society I would
(1:07:10) I would start elsewhere that's all I'm saying now yeah where would you start Nick as I said I would start with
(1:07:16) culture I would start with education yeah well I mean but I don't understand when you say you start with culture what
(1:07:21) would be the mechanism for which you would affect culture as a leader who would pass no laws I I would it's it's on every
(1:07:29) individual it's it's their responsibility to do it it's our respons do anything as a leader is what you're
(1:07:34) saying I wouldn't I wouldn't want to be a leader so so let me just make sure I got this right leader here's Nick's
(1:07:42) leadership Le I don't want to be a leader do nothing if Nick were a leader do nothing and if Nick conceivably were
(1:07:50) put in a leadership position he would say he would change the culture by doing nothing excellently well done Nick you
(1:07:58) have definitely solved the problems of the United States with your epic
(1:08:03) leadership skills of doing nothing wonderfully done no listen highly
(1:08:10) appreciative Nick I'm not gonna be a dictator I'm not listen to me I'm not gonna be a dictator I'm not going to be
(1:08:16) a leader I'm not trying to be a leader that's not that's not my point my point is but the the the the question became this if you were in charge and you did
(1:08:24) not change law because you don't think it affects culture the Nick how would you change culture propaganda the way
(1:08:31) we're changing it now the way people are would you need to have a law in place in
(1:08:36) order to produce propaganda no no you don't clearly you don't because all the [ __ ] all the all the ways we're brainwashing people now doesn't depend
(1:08:44) on the law yes it does I mean yeah it's within the limits of the law oh so it's based on the
(1:08:51) law so it's based on the law Nick you're not listening to me I'm
(1:08:56) listening bro I'm listening no I'm saying obviously there are things that you can't do but there isn't a law
(1:09:04) telling us what we have to do we're brainwashing ourselves the way we choose okay so what you're saying is that
(1:09:10) there's no law so there's no law hey wait so you're saying that there's no law which has a threshold for propaganda
(1:09:18) only a law that does not have a threshold for propaganda So within the prescription of law everyone can do
(1:09:24) propaganda but couldn't you just make a law saying that only certain people could make propaganda which was good for
(1:09:29) the culture and since you're the leader shouldn't you no I wouldn't want to do that no you wouldn't want to do that who
(1:09:35) decides what's good who decides what's bad well you're the leader don't you decide no no no no no this this whole
(1:09:43) discussion is based on our opinions okay it's not yeah but you're the leader in
(1:09:48) this hypothetical imp any of you're the leader in this hypothetical you're in
(1:09:53) charge Nick what I guess unethically I'd have to I'd have to manipulate what gets more
(1:10:01) publicity what gets well what are those things Nick what gets more publicity what do you do to ctail the problems of
(1:10:08) the United States I don't care actually I don't know what I would decide I'm not I'm probably the least qualified person
(1:10:15) to decide that but I think that all I'm trying to say is whoever wanted to be in that role I
(1:10:22) think they'd be you would be right there to criticize them wouldn't you Nick at least whoever was in that role Nick
(1:10:28) would be right there to criticize them even though Nick if he was in that role wouldn't do anything well Nick how how
(1:10:34) long should I let you talk before I ever get to respond well let me finish I'm sorry my points are a bit long make them short
(1:10:43) you turn them into something they're not well that's no no I'm just giving you entailments of what you're saying bro I
(1:10:48) know it's uncomfortable but it's an entailment I can't I don't I don't I'm leaving I'm leaving because the point
(1:10:54) I'm trying to make okay no no no nick nick are you leaving Nick are you running Nick you leaving
(1:11:00) all right Nick [Music]
