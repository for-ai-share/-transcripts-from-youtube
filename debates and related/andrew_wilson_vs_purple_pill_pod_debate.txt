URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9bDf82UfFU&t=777s

(0:01) all right what up guys we are online so we have a really fun uh debate for you
(0:06) today we got Andrew who you guys know he's been on this channel about a bazillion times uh it's pretty
(0:11) interesting uh kind of uh relationship slash partnership that I guess me and The Crucible audience have formed
(0:17) because we're so totally different in terms of the theology but uh we seem to have really good conversations together
(0:22) and then you guys know serger from the purple pill podcast he's been on my channel I believe once but I also was on
(0:29) his channel uh he has a pretty cool podcast that I think deserves more recognition so uh check that out as well
(0:35) and they're going to be debating about marriage so Andrew is pro marriage uh
(0:40) Sergio is against marriage I'm generally going to be uh hands off uh you know
(0:45) during this debate unless I have to step in I don't think this is going to be nearly to the same level of uh let's
(0:51) just say intensity is the boss debate but you never know you never know also I see a few you guys in the chat saying oh
(0:56) well when's the speed dating speed dating is tomorrow I promise it is happening tomorrow but um this uh this
(1:02) debate is gonna be a lot of fun so I think we should do this let's start off with doing like two or three minute
(1:08) opening statements Sergio since you were the initiator I think you should uh go first uh give your opening statement why
(1:14) you think marriage is a bad idea for men or kind of what your positions are then Andrew will give his opening statement
(1:19) and they'll just be open floor and then we'll try to keep those two no more than an hour and a half unless it's like
(1:25) getting really juicy two hours Max and then we will try to do a little bit of an open Panel uh which I feel like we
(1:30) didn't get enough time to uh to get that done last time but anyway let's get into it Sergio kick it off my man
(1:36) yeah so um I believe that we're in a post marriage Society uh I think that
(1:42) pre uh marriage coming about 6 000 years ago with religion I think it came as just control mechanism for men the Bible
(1:49) and everything that is hanging on real quick I'm sorry to cut in but Sergio is it possible you're using the wrong mic
(1:54) it sounds like maybe you're talking through a computer mic instead of through your regular microphone
(2:00) it's like I thought that we had checked that but I guess not it actually sounds pretty fun on my end
(2:06) but you know you can double check yeah my settings are correct so yeah I'm not sure why that's for you man uh okay
(2:12) never never mind go ahead I didn't mean I'll equalize it on my end as well so yeah I should be good but okay anyway uh
(2:19) kick it back off in uh Sergio yeah okay but yeah I think we're in a post marriage Society I think a pre 6 000
(2:25) years ago for Homo sapiens for about a hundred thousand years so for about 95 of our time 94 of our time I think that
(2:32) we did something called interchangeable monogamy or serial monogamy uh serial relationships
(2:37) um because I mean that's just was the norm before marriage uh you there wasn't any type of control mechanism on men
(2:43) marriage is a control mechanism that's why the man gets down on one knee to propose to the woman it is all too so
(2:50) for the man to submit to her and give her all the leverage in the relationship after that point
(2:55) um I think that it is the greatest thing uh in a good Society like we had for the last six thousand years and it was great
(3:01) to push us up to the point that we're at right now it's something that we we we definitely need it and it definitely is
(3:06) the best route but in a post-mage society um when body counts are at where they're at when marriage divorce rates
(3:12) uh the marriage rates are as low as they are we have to start looking at other solutions for things because not
(3:18) everybody's going to come out in these perfect relationships and uh you know I'm doing everything how we want it to be or how we wish it to be so we have to
(3:25) start coming up with solutions for if it's not going to be perfect um I would love for us to come up with
(3:30) other Solutions where we change the laws and we change things to make marriage have more incentive but like I said as of right now in this post-marriage
(3:37) Society until we change anything I don't think that men should be getting married um unless you find a unicorn if you find
(3:43) a unicorn I think that you should go for it but I don't think most of these men are going to find a unicorn
(3:51) okay Andrew uh Kick It Off okay well first and foremost uh to
(3:57) mellov uh fort out in my chat happy birthday uh long time Crucible member
(4:02) just wanted to throw that out with some of my opening time because this won't take very long I don't actually
(4:09) understand what the argument is is the if I think that he's saying that the argument is that men are controlled by
(4:16) marriage my argument back has said Men actually control Society so we can control the outcomes for marriage too if
(4:22) we so collectively choose that would be my first argument but kind of moving forward from that try to understand that
(4:29) you still have all sorts of stats that you need to contend with so I haven't heard him bring up religion at all which is insane if you look at the stats for
(4:36) the religious who get married is far different from the stats of the secularists who get married and it seems to favor religious men to get married
(4:43) their health and happiness is far better they make more money they're more stable and by the way he
(4:50) also hasn't brought up the most pivotal point which is what about children we do need to have children in this
(4:57) Society I assume and so if we do need to have children in this Society doesn't he want them to come from homes where
(5:03) there's a mommy and a daddy and they're married knowing what the stats are for unmarried couples is worse than for
(5:10) married couples and the chances that you can walk out the door much higher as well so I just kind of want to get right
(5:16) into this and see what uh what his options are for these things as a societal as a society-wide prescription
(5:24) yeah it's good like good point definitely good points so the thing is I come from a divorced family my parents
(5:30) divorced when I was around six my parents remarried pretty quickly after um because of that there was a hyper
(5:36) competition between my two fathers my stepfather and my father hated each other and it caused my father to do
(5:41) whatever he could to sign me up for sports get me into more competition so he could spend more than just us every other weekend with me
(5:47) um so he could be coached for the teams and do more stuff with me myself sounds like it sounds like divorce was really
(5:53) bad then and it's so no no if your parents stayed together well if you would let me finish then you'd
(5:58) understand what I'm trying to explain is that my stepfather also taught me hunting taught me how to drive race cars taught me a whole different skill set so
(6:05) I was able to have two different skill sets from two different fathers that were both six-figure men and killed it
(6:10) in life in every aspect um and I had two mothers that were actually pretty excellent mothers too so because of that I actually got it as a
(6:17) cheat code now there are people who have it the the horrible way whenever a divorce happens the thing is is we know
(6:23) that
(6:29) don't care about your anecdotes I care about the argument are you proposing that all people should have two moms and
(6:36) Two Dads no perfect no good point so who do you give advice to what age of men do you give advice to Andrew
(6:42) I don't give advice to men you don't give advice to men you don't give tricon prescriptions for anything you don't
(6:48) think that I give society-wide political prescription I give Society wide political prescriptions to things but I
(6:54) don't do advice giving I'm not a one of these red pill Pua teachers who write
(7:00) some kind of [ __ ] program and tries to sell it online I'm a political commentator and a political pundit and a
(7:05) political debater right now you're talking about a political issue which is the political issue of marriage and if
(7:12) you want a prescription for that issue I want to actually hear what the prescription is because you're saying that men shouldn't get married at all
(7:18) which seems insane to me and I haven't heard a single argument out of you for how you would even accomplish this as a
(7:24) prescription one and two uh all you do is kind of give me anecdotes so you start off with an anecdote of My Two
(7:30) Dads and my two moms like well that's great because there's nuance and even if we were giving prescriptions to the Y to
(7:36) the wide variety this is this is what I'm talking about for in general because in general the marriage rate is low in
(7:41) general the divorce rates are high in general rule 80 percent of women initiate divorce yeah those are his statements yeah so what's your ought
(7:47) statement yeah so what I I had a child outside of wedlock and I don't think it's a bad
(7:53) thing I don't think it was a horrible thing I'm still raising her perfectly I have 50 50 with my with my uh the mother
(7:58) and my daughter the thing is we have all these negative um connotations towards these things and we think that all this stuff is so bad
(8:04) I'm a Broken Man from a broken family but trauma builds men and it destroys women so I don't understand why it's a
(8:10) bad thing for men to choose a certain route this is you I don't even think you
(8:16) realize how stupid what you're saying is you're saying that because because trauma builds up men shouldn't all men
(8:23) then have to go through a divorced family because it's going to build them up like it did for you no I'm saying
(8:29) that there's a high percentage chance that that's naturally going to happen to a man so we need to focus on the solutions and not crying about it
(8:34) because it's feminine to cry and complain about it yeah
(8:39) if it's a high percentage chance that this is going to happen don't you want
(8:45) to go out of your way to have prescriptions so that it doesn't happen rather than going out of your way to
(8:50) have prescriptions for what you consider an inevitable will happen it is the best prescription but in a postman society
(8:56) when people aren't religious and women are sleeping around and we don't all go to church and we're not all perfect then you have to think of other Solutions you
(9:02) have to figure out well that way to do it that way there's never been a time where people have been perfect or that
(9:09) Society has been perfect you think for instance that when people are getting when people are getting married during
(9:15) wartime that that's perfect or when people are getting married during times of famine that that's perfect that's
(9:21) insane Andrew you're trying to tell me the internet age the last 10 15 years hasn't drastically changed the world
(9:27) you're living in a bubble what are you talking about what does that have to do with anything I just said what I'm
(9:32) saying is that because it has drastically changed in the last 10 15 years it takes drastic changes in the sexual Marketplace we're in a
(9:38) post-marriage society it's not the best for anybody to be getting married it's not it's not the best for them saying
(9:45) that it was the best saying in the world for the religious to get married when it's a hedonistic world where
(9:52) everybody's around everybody is hurt do you disagree with me that but why wouldn't the prescription that doesn't
(9:58) make any sense so why wouldn't the prescription instead be to move towards policies prescriptions for society where
(10:04) people were less hedonistic rather than just say this is the way it's got to be fellas
(10:11) well I guess we're just gonna have to knuckle under and deal with the fact that Society oh no I'm the only person
(10:16) in this space that talks about Solutions I'm the only one who actually teaches guys how to go get on the board of cities of their city and their local
(10:21) government what do you mean I push for this more than anybody there's not one person in the politics so then we can actually
(10:28) change things started okay
(10:40) what I'm talking about when it comes to a prescription you're saying to me Andrew society sucks right now for men I
(10:47) don't disagree right things are unfair for men I don't disagree we're moving into a post-marriage world I don't even
(10:53) disagree with that it does seem like we're moving more and more in the west towards a post-marriage world however if
(10:59) you're talking about prescriptions to these things don't you want to move it so that we're not in a post-marriage
(11:06) world so that we do live in a world where men and women can have Dynamics again where men and women can get
(11:13) married again and where the divorce rates are much lower here's an idea for such a prescription for instance no
(11:18) fault divorce no fault divorce has drastically increased divorce rates because it gives
(11:24) an incentive for women to get divorced that would be a good prescription for instance to get rid of no fault divorce
(11:30) so that we had less divorces for these more optimal outcomes you're talking about all you're talking about is just
(11:37) hey everybody accept it and take it and put up with it
(11:44) and I'll pass it over your only prescription is good luck welcome to the new world here's your two dads and two
(11:50) moms so that's that's just one thing you heard but the thing is two things can be right at the same time Andrew I can push
(11:56) men into politics to change things while at the same time finding solutions for the [ __ ] that we're in right now that's
(12:02) the problem is everything else complaints and doesn't actually do action I mean those Solutions those are what I care about like I said if if we
(12:09) live in a post-marriage society and say a guy wants to have a child there are women out here that you're that guy that
(12:16) will still have your child even if you're not married there are women out here that will still love you and still
(12:21) want to be with you for the rest of their life without marriage there it just depends how good of a man that you
(12:26) are today when guys kill themselves or off themselves at nine times the rate of uh
(12:32) of after marriage after a divorce that's a big deal men need to protect themselves not every man is going to be
(12:39) able to make it through those types of things like why I don't know why you don't
(12:44) understand this I can agree with those stats and even say that that's true but
(12:49) then when I look at the root cause the root cause would seem to be divorcing divorcing seems to be the root cause so
(12:55) if I have prescriptions so if I have prescriptions to eliminate that root cause while keeping intact all
(13:02) the benefits of marriage especially with children that this would be like no fault divorce would be one of those
(13:08) causes there's other causes that I can give you as well that would be very helpful to solving this problem again your only prescription here seems to be
(13:15) just accept that this is the world and there's nothing you can do about it
(13:20) while at the same time you talk into the other side of your face and say but I am pushing men to do something what are you
(13:26) pushing those men to do to do exactly what you just said we can all agree I cannot I'm not that different from you
(13:32) Andrew and like I said like don't don't like straw man I'm saying that both things can be done at the same time okay
(13:37) both things can be done at the same time you can sit here and push man into politics and do the exact laws that I
(13:42) agree with you on should be changed while at the same time how because we can't just click our fingers and the law
(13:48) has changed okay we can't just do that so because of that you have to have two things two things can be right at the
(13:54) same time no wait do you even know what the process of changing a lot is could
(13:59) you even tell us what that is do you think that I need to be able to do that for me to be able to push people
(14:05) to make a law change you just got done making the statement that oh hey man you can't just snap your fingers and change
(14:12) a law what do you think the process for changing the law is Sir it's actually having these types of
(14:18) conversations but at the highest these types of conversations change the laws huh well that's the process how are you
(14:24) supposed to change the laws if people don't even know for the best Solutions and even if nobody's even talking about
(14:30) those Solutions and it's getting viral that's the problem with the world today is nothing so why don't you just say no Andrew I don't actually know what the
(14:36) process is to change it no Andrew I don't even need to know what the process is is my point
(14:48) you're going to do both of these things at the same time you're gonna do one of these things both these things at the same time one of these things you don't
(14:54) even know what the [ __ ] process is just making [ __ ] up as you go Andrew if you think that you know grandstanding
(15:00) and thinking that you're above somebody because you understand how laws are made and I can't articulately tell you right
(15:07) now it's hard to articulate this stuff I'm not articulate enough to be able one day
(15:14) you'll be able to articulately tell us how to articulately laws into existence hey man are you married
(15:19) I am so everybody probably argues from the point of view that they are you know
(15:24) that they're living and uh would you want your woman to divorce you do you want to be divorced you want to stay
(15:29) together for the rest of your life yeah okay well if that's what you want then don't you think that telling other men
(15:36) to do something similar um just because it worked out for you is kind of damaging when we live in a society that that's not how it's working
(15:42) out for other men right now that are younger than you no why
(15:48) because I want the best prescription for everybody and when I look at all the stats and all the numbers I see that the
(15:55) games that men get when they're in these happy marriages especially if they're religious are overwhelmingly beneficial
(16:02) not just to them because I'm not a hedonist but to who I have said this multiple times the children you do want
(16:10) to have children in your future Society correct you actually want to have kids in that Society yeah and don't you and
(16:17) you don't you think and don't you think it would have been optimal in your situation even though I understand you
(16:23) had the child outside of wedlock I'm not judging you for this but I am saying that if if you could go back and have
(16:30) the same child all things equal same kid no distinction at all but with a woman
(16:35) who you really loved and cared about it was just you and her and the child wouldn't that be your preference
(16:50) I've told you at the very beginning of the stream that I agree with all religious prescriptions I actually teach
(16:56) on my show religious prescriptions you can't believe in religious prescriptions and then preach Hedonism lunatic what
(17:03) you don't understand is that two things can be right at the same time this is what's so hard for you to understand I don't know if your brain can't comprehend that you can do one thing
(17:10) while doing another thing at the same time you can say what is best while also saying that in this Society there's
(17:16) these other options that you can take because you're not going to be perfect or if you [ __ ] up this is what you can
(17:21) do because the bottom line is guys aren't living in the same world that we lived in 20 30 years ago and we're trying to do the same Disney princess
(17:27) you know what I want to do I want to collectivize men so that we can begin to
(17:32) change laws so that we can move back towards a world where relationships function in marriage functions so we can
(17:37) have all the benefits for us for the marriages and the most importantly all those benefits for the children which as
(17:44) you conceded five seconds ago if you could go back and have your child with a woman who you loved and you stayed
(17:50) together with that woman forever you would prefer why wouldn't we be moving all of our energies towards that world
(17:55) instead of towards a world where we can all be a bunch of hedonist pieces of [ __ ] who are just [ __ ] everybody
(18:01) playing house and being [ __ ] uh and at the same time somehow trying to
(18:08) produce these wonderful religious outcomes for people don't you understand how stupid that sounds man
(18:14) do you understand how stupid it is when wait here I gotta ask you this so a girl that goes to church and she has a 20 30
(18:20) body count but she's a born-again virgin do you want a guy to marry her do you want a guy that's you know uh that has a
(18:26) two body count to marry a woman like that uh do I want a guy who has a two body
(18:32) count to marry a woman who has screwed 30 guys I mean yeah
(18:40) stop stop I'm gonna answer your question largely this would be up to the guy uh
(18:45) within this hypothetical let's say though let's assume all things are equal and we can say this I'll use the exact
(18:51) same hypothetical back assume that you had a woman who had a 30 body count but was a born-again
(18:58) Christian told you that she was going to live the rest of her life for you and do everything in her power to make you
(19:04) happy and that she understood that she made these mistakes or you had a woman who had a 20 body count but had none of
(19:10) those [ __ ] values whatsoever uh which one would you take the risk in marrying
(19:17) neither you you find one that that's something hypothetical the hypothetical is bifurcated for a reason in order to
(19:25) probe your logic to find out if it's consistent if you only had those two choices which one would you pick
(19:32) obviously the one with the good morals right right so so what we've established
(19:38) then is that morality is the preference of the day and so that's what we ought to be striving for
(19:45) so will you answer like mine now is so so which one would you so so do you
(19:52) want a guy that has a low body count we'll just say a low one we don't have to say two he just has a load ball count to be with a woman who has a 30 body
(19:58) count she's a born-again Christian if she if she loves him and she's going to live her life for him and he loves her
(20:03) back and they have a wonderful family together for the rest of their life that's what reforming is about that's
(20:09) what that is literally about sending men into the fire that's literally
(20:15) [Music] for dirty bodies and then matching her with her social calibration compared to
(20:21) a man that's only been with three four five women it's not even close to the same she's gonna run laps on him and
(20:27) take full advantage of him how can you even say that that's okay for men to do that so you're asking oh that's why I'm
(20:34) bringing up here like that stop spergy listen you're
(20:41) talking about optimals here okay in this particular case you could make some case it's not socially Optical or optimal
(20:48) sorry it's not socially optimal for them to do this okay I could concede that that's true but then you have to answer
(20:54) this are they doing anything immoral
(21:01) what do you mean are they doing something immoral like is
(21:06) the woman doing something immoral or is anybody of these parties doing anything immoral
(21:11) well no I'm just saying don't [ __ ] care you gotta understand that telling guys
(21:18) that have a low body count to be with a woman that get married to a woman that possibly is a boring inversion with 30 bodies there's nothing wrong with it
(21:25) literally just said there's nothing wrong with it the people getting married right now is that exact scenario I just
(21:31) said a guy with a low body count beta bucks dude with a woman with a high body cow and she's gonna run game on him for
(21:36) the best thing but there's nothing immoral about that right no it's just horrible for the guy and he's gonna end up hurt and he's going to end up the one
(21:43) offing himself so you're saying that guy should do what's in their optimal interest okay but there's nothing inside
(21:48) of this situation which is immoral correct I don't see how that has anything to do
(21:55) with what because again why is it that you're not striving for the most moral system because within the confines of
(22:00) the moral system we have the best outcomes and that's what you want is an outcomes-based Society that's what you just said that's what Hedonism is you
(22:07) want outcomes to be really really really good you already said that you would have the preference of the moral woman
(22:12) even over the woman who had the lower body count who had lower morals so if you don't see anything morally wrong
(22:19) with it I don't even know why the [ __ ] you're teaching it well let's change it around then you said 20 and 30 which is
(22:24) a really stupid number honestly let's say five if the girl had five but bad morals I would choose the girl with five
(22:30) because you don't understand that most people aren't living a moralistic life today and going to church so because of
(22:36) that yeah be a really good person and not be awful about all crazy about
(22:41) morals the thing is a girl can have a low body count and that that's a sign of her having good morals so if she just
(22:47) has a five body count that's the problem is you're assuming between the 20 and a
(22:52) 30 body count girl no they have a choice between a five body yeah girl this is great actually this is good now we're making progress so it does sound like
(22:59) you think that if a woman has a lower body count one of the reasons your preference is towards that woman is
(23:05) because you think that that's a good sign of virtue and their for Morality hey that's great and if you think so
(23:11) then you think that it's a moral prescription Sergio do you understand now you think that this is yeah your
(23:19) example was horrible because you put two numbers right next to each other that's why I made mine so broad I said a five body count guy with a 30 bucks it makes
(23:26) it it wouldn't matter if it's one to two or two to twenty oh trust me it does I'm sure you've seen this stuff
(23:34) 20 bodies it is but do you realize don't you
(23:39) understand that within the confines of the hypothetical to test the logic it doesn't matter
(23:45) now if you're going to map it on to like reality this is this is what's real
(23:50) um I again I can concede the point because it doesn't matter if you're mapping it onto a hypothetical to test
(23:56) the logic you understand the distinction there yeah but I'm still gonna stand on the
(24:02) fact that you're sitting here trying to say that uh that it's it's it's no different or that the morality for a
(24:09) woman with 30 bodies isn't as long as she's a born and Christian it's fine like that's good that's asinine that you even say that that like guys are
(24:15) listening okay to be with a woman like that you're not even tracking she's moral you said
(24:21) if she's moral right bro you said that when I asked you that
(24:26) question you said that would be your preference no but then right after that no do we need to rewind the tape bro you
(24:32) literally said you literally said that it would be okay as long as she's moral for a guy to choose that or it's up to
(24:37) the guy to choose you said it would be up to the guy it's up to the guy to choose but if she's moral that's a good
(24:43) choice and no it's not she's not moral then you can go get a younger woman
(24:49) so it's immoral yes so it's immoral okay yes yes if a
(24:55) woman is that 30 bodies okay and she's the Morgan she's not moral bro so she's
(25:00) just chameleon she's just a chameleon okay so no you go I choose I teach guys literally how to go find young women and
(25:07) the whole reason why is because they don't have high body counts and they having bad trauma so hang on so so
(25:12) backing up so if a woman has a 30 body count and
(25:17) that and as a born-again Christian your exact words just now were that means she's immoral however when this
(25:24) hypothetical is put to you versus a woman who has low moral character has a 20 body count not a mordigan Christian
(25:30) your preference is still the immoral Christian okay let me explain this to you since it's uh let me dumb it down
(25:35) for you a little bit so here's the thing every study shows after 20 bodies the woman's [ __ ] okay so when you give an
(25:42) example like that like that really dumb example with 20 and 30 yes obviously it's basically the same thing because
(25:48) they're both [ __ ] up women they're both already over 20. that's why I still prefer the one that's a Christian right
(25:55) because it's they're both [ __ ] at the end of the day they're both dude
(26:01) okay okay got it stop spurging bro you don't have to stop
(26:07) spurging so back to this I I just this is begging the question what makes the
(26:13) woman who reforms becomes the born-again Christian and then refutes her past and
(26:18) says I no longer want to be this woman right I'm no longer going to do these activities anymore yes I [ __ ] up but
(26:25) I'm not going to do it anymore why is she immoral because she should have thought that 15
(26:32) 20 25 bodies ago so she's currently immoral even though
(26:39) she has recanted this activity no longer engages in the activity she's always for the rest of her life immoral because of
(26:46) these things she did uh before she she cleaned up her act and reformed
(26:51) if you're somebody that has anything to lose wouldn't you want to have insurance
(26:56) and make sure any girl check the Carfax you know make sure that it's like a a good thing on on paper
(27:03) and that's not good on paper any man would say that it's not good to be with a woman who had the uh the want to do
(27:10) this this is not my question though you I just need you to focus on what I'm asking why is it that you think this woman is
(27:17) immoral more morality uh as a reference point
(27:22) they've Shrugged off all of this Behavior no longer engaging it but you just got done telling me this woman is
(27:29) still immoral just the fact that she did this at all she's always immoral there
(27:34) is no path to Redemption she is forever an immoral human being now do you
(27:39) honestly believe that that's not so this is why I'm gonna explain it to you again so it's a percentage chance thing if the
(27:46) percentage chance is higher with this woman of divorce of bad things happening then you shouldn't give them a chance I
(27:52) don't care about the morality I don't care it's a statistics game and as men we need to be looking at those types of
(27:58) things you can't just go into it blind and thinking I trust her it's no big deal
(28:03) but she's morally good now it is it is about the the morality
(28:10) though because what you're really focusing on is bad outcomes and you think bad outcomes are bad if you think
(28:16) a thing is bad you think it's immoral if you think it's good you think it's moral that's how that works so bad immoral
(28:23) good moral so if you think these things are bad you think they're immoral for instance I think getting a divorce is
(28:28) bad so do I think getting a divorce is immoral yes right these this is what I'm
(28:34) talking about could there be reasons for getting a divorce which are good yes you
(28:39) see what I'm saying so when you're saying when you make these kind of bad and good prescriptions fair enough okay I agree with you that probably you
(28:47) shouldn't be trying to run around and find women who have humped 20 [ __ ] dudes or 30 dudes or 40 dudes or even 10
(28:53) dudes probably far better far more optimal not to do these things however to try to make this kind of bold claim
(29:00) that a woman who reforms stops those activities and then wants to devote her
(29:05) life to a man is somehow immoral that's insane to me you say I don't care about the morality but while we're talking
(29:11) about is morality when you say thing good you're saying thing moral
(29:17) yeah well the thing is is like I said men need to protect themselves more now
(29:24) than ever nine times the the rate of offing themselves just when you look at
(29:29) anything it shows any of the stats the divorce stats they're just looping and NPC we've been
(29:35) over this yeah this is true but this has nothing to do with the current status of the debate which is
(29:42) we're talking about why it's moral or immoral there's no so it really is not immoral for a man to marry a woman who
(29:49) has reformed Shrugged off her past and no longer engaged in that activity it's not a memorial thing is it you misspoke
(29:54) and that was incorrect I'm not going to sit there and debate over the morality of a [ __ ] marrying a dude that she has
(30:01) way more social calibration over and way more advantage over in every aspect of a relationship because of her experience
(30:07) so it's normal for those two people to get married no it's not immoral it's unsafe
(30:15) you know what you're doing is quibbling so you all you want to do is you want to
(30:20) say there's step well the stats favor this okay but I've conceded the stats
(30:25) favor that so we have to get to that guy I just understand that we have to get the underlying reasoning behind why the
(30:32) stats are doing this right why are the stats bad why are they sloped why are these things good why are are they bad
(30:39) or even prepared to have that conversation yeah because interchangeable monogamy was the was the
(30:44) rule for most of human history That's why nothing works marriage is not good
(30:49) for men that's why it never usually ends up they want to have multiple women so it's
(30:55) never good for a man to get married if a man smokes more like try the interchangeable morality that's not good
(31:01) let's start with interchangeable or I'm sorry interchangeable monogamy let's clarify this and then maybe I can I can
(31:08) pinpoint down on this or hone in on this because this seems to be something you say a lot so interchangeable monogamy to
(31:14) Sergio means what uh multiple relationships within one lifetime not just one person that you
(31:21) stay with for your entire life okay and you think that this is the historic standard
(31:26) it was the rule for most of History okay where a pre six thousand eight thousand years
(31:33) ago uh that if you recorded history started 5500 years ago
(31:39) no I'm saying that if we just look at evolutionary psychology and we just look at what's been found we can easily find
(31:44) these things like you could there's evolutionary psychology huh yeah do you not like evolutionary psychology well
(31:50) it's [ __ ] so no you don't like evolutionary psychologists
(31:56) its foundation is completely and totally founded on Evolution right evolutionary
(32:03) psychology Revolution no oh you're a Fundamentalist
(32:09) are you a fundamentalist Christian no I'm an Orthodox Christian I mean it sounds pretty fundamentalist
(32:14) if you don't believe in evolution I don't even think you know what fundamentalist means oh no I know what it means but mostly what does it means
(32:21) today and they're actually fundamentalist Christians but they act like they're all these other different sects no you're just a fundamentalist
(32:26) anybody who reads the Bible what a fundamentalist doesn't believe in evolution is definitely somebody who
(32:32) believes that the Earth is only 8 000 years old or thinks that the dinosaurs were never here or all that stupid [ __ ]
(32:37) yeah a fundamentalist believes the Bible literally okay and that's what you're
(32:42) basically doing it sounds like that's what our fundamentalist is you don't believe in the evolution you don't even know what the [ __ ] you're talking about
(32:48) but you know what I'm still going to Grant your worldview just for the sake of argument and ask you again
(32:55) where do you think these things were going on with interchangeable monogamy or multiple partners where monogamy was
(33:02) not the order of the day post-universal morality which we've had for 3000 years yeah so homo sapiens go back about a
(33:09) hundred thousand years so I would say from a hundred thousand years ago to about six thousand and five thousand years ago whenever
(33:15) um the Torah and everything was pushing everybody into getting married yeah before that I would say for the most
(33:21) part it was a lot of entertainment monogamy it was because like say your wife or or you had like a girl or
(33:26) whatever and like y'all had a baby and then the husband goes and gets stomped by woolly mammoth yes she's gonna have
(33:32) to go to another man after that to possibly survive so yes interchangeable monogamy was a thing for most of our
(33:37) history because a guy could die from even even with monogamy that that would
(33:44) be the same thing so you've always been permitted to remarry after your husband died
(33:49) yeah that's so that would still be interchangeable monogamy you're still going to another relationship after the first one so like try to understand this
(33:57) Sergio because you're leaving this part out and perhaps you can evolutionarily psychologize it for me so if we move
(34:06) back uh to 2000 years to Universal Universal morality Universal ethics what
(34:13) we find is something very interesting which is that if we go back three four thousand years we look at the records we
(34:19) find that most men were not able to actually procreate because women have
(34:24) always been the gatekeeper so what ended up happening was high status men were able to hoard a lot of women unto
(34:31) themselves you agree that that's true right yes yeah this was the this was the
(34:36) order of the day for a long long time what we find though that's so
(34:42) interesting is that once the ethics move over to Christian ethics and Universal ethics now there's enough women readily
(34:48) available for all men when that happens crime goes way down Society stabilizes
(34:54) happiness indexes go through the roof inventiveness goes through the roof
(34:59) family quality goes through the roof because now suddenly there's enough women for every man
(35:05) that sounds like it's highly optimal even via your evolutionarily
(35:10) psychologizing perspective not only that not only that but try to recognize that
(35:16) if you believe in evolution which you do then the Pinnacle of your belief is that human beings had to have evolved towards
(35:23) monogamy we had to have evolved towards it or we would never make laws or anything else regarding it in the first
(35:29) place Andrew were you listening when I first started my first statement where I said
(35:34) that I agree that everything that was happening from religion and through
(35:40) monogamy and marriage that it was all a good thing I know that that's what brought us to this point I know it's the
(35:45) best thing I'm saying what is yeah we evolved towards it okay yeah but you have to also concede the second part of
(35:51) the argument we must have evolved towards monogamy or we would not have monogamy you're right but we can evolve
(35:57) right back with the internet and turning us you can evolve back yes because the internet has made it you think the
(36:04) internet makes us smarter people ever and you you think that it made us
(36:10) smarter you think it made us dumber with access to more information than ever well yeah yeah but before you jump the goal
(36:16) post I answer your question but I just want to ask you you think that we're evolving back
(36:22) I think that we are going to take a step back not evolving back we can't evolve
(36:27) backwards so if we evolve through that our nature move towards monogamy via
(36:32) evolutionary psychology and we know looking at the past trends that when
(36:38) every man is able to have access to women Society is healthy happier children are healthier and happier why
(36:45) wouldn't you try to be moving towards that as opposed to anything else wouldn't that be your highest priority
(36:51) it's almost as if we could do two things at one time like I've said a dozen times to the show but you can't do two things
(36:56) at once if one conflicts with the value structures of the other because one of them necessarily is going to be wrong
(37:02) so it contradicts your modalism you have like this bizarre modal model it works like this okay
(37:08) you say listen right now for the sake of society because it's all [ __ ] up we should act
(37:14) like complete hedonist animal pieces of [ __ ] and as immoral as possible so that we can continue to push towards a moral
(37:21) Society do you see how that sounds contradictory to everybody who hears it you're saying all the values that I want
(37:28) all the things I want to strive for all the things that make Society good that we should be moving for [ __ ] them we
(37:33) need to live in the Now ladies and gentlemen do what's good for us right this second while we move towards that
(37:40) Society don't you think you moved towards that Society through behavioral adaptation of even the few of us who
(37:46) understand that that's where we need to go living that lifestyle and being Trailblazers for the ones who come after
(37:52) us rather than just giving in to oh well society's [ __ ] up I could [ __ ] it I guess
(37:58) Andrew every night on my show that I do a panel I teach these women the religious
(38:05) prescriptions so they do exactly tell them that fundamentalism
(38:11) but the problem is that yeah but the problem is most people though don't live a perfect life and they can go back to
(38:18) that so I have to be able to also help them even if they're imperfect because not everybody's perfect or can be
(38:24) perfect so because of that you have to do both it's really crazy you should
(38:29) live in this world where it's just you could just always everybody could just always be perfect you just everybody
(38:34) needs to be over here and if you're not virtue signaling and over here perfectly virtuous then you're over here and
(38:39) that's ridiculous do you also believe that heaven and hell is is a place that you go after death do you think of it
(38:45) not hell no and do you think Heaven is a place that you go after death yeah really some
(38:50) people yeah really so heaven isn't here on Earth heaven isn't here on Earth no hell isn't here on Earth well we call
(38:57) it if you're talking about the ascaton and what you would consider having the no
(39:03) hmm crazy yeah see this is the problem with Christians today they don't even understand Christianity they don't even
(39:09) know them it sounds like one of us doesn't understand it no you don't even understand Heaven and Hell correctly
(39:15) this is pretty bad I'll tell you what if that's true can you give me a single Bible passage that
(39:21) even references Hell or Heaven even once no I don't have to can you give me a
(39:27) single Bible passage that says anything no I don't have no UK's [ __ ]
(39:33) Christians don't understand anything you can't even give me a single quote from the Bible the dumb Christians don't
(39:40) understand nothing though give me one quote about it then since you're the Christians
(39:48) we're getting off topic in religion we can you guys can Andrew can sum up his
(39:54) thoughts because uh I think uh Sergio made the common loss about him but after that let's redirect back to uh the
(40:00) initial topic which is marriage yeah okay so just kind of me wrapping this up on this end and by the way wife get me
(40:06) some coffee uh Sergio you should tell your wife to get you some coffee too yeah my girl will gladly do it because I
(40:13) have a nice young beautiful girlfriend that I got after having my after leaving my baby mother you know the thing here
(40:20) with you how to get your coffee for you I have a whole separate Studio from my home because I'm able to afford stuff
(40:26) like that I'm on multiple businesses even though I'm a failure that came from a divorced family
(40:31) you guys are both doing it wrong what you gotta do is train your dog to get you coffee
(40:38) right now I think that's fair yeah I will definitely rebuilding a studio at
(40:43) my house soon and I will make sure my girl comes and brings me coffee right there in the studio just for you and your trade cons to see that you can
(40:50) still get women to do that for you even after you do everything the horrible way yeah yeah well I mean when you have a
(40:57) big beautiful nice home you just build a [ __ ] studio right there it's no big deal but anyway I'm kind of back to the
(41:02) topic back to the topic at hand uh yes it was a cheap shot but okay you seem like you're a good sport it's all in
(41:08) good fun right so Andrew I love you honestly so moving
(41:14) back so moving back into the topic here at hand uh now that we've established there are moral principles that we do
(41:21) need to operate off of don't you think that it's conflicting for you to be giving advice which are antithetical to
(41:27) your own morals I understand uh telling men or messaging men giving out like a
(41:32) signal like a bat signal almost saying look this is bad this is bad this is bad it's bad that men uh have these high
(41:39) indexes of suicide rates that's terrible it's bad that you get [ __ ] over in the divorce courts that's awful all these
(41:46) things are awful but we still have to think about children Sergio and men do have duties you agree that men have
(41:52) duties and you also would agree that it's optimal for a man and a woman to be married when they do have these children
(41:58) and that is a society that you want to live in so shouldn't we be pushing for that more than anything else man
(42:05) yeah I really want people to do it that best way man I really do I really do want people to do it that best way but
(42:10) some people are [ __ ] ups like me so how do we get you on our side to advocate for that how do we get you there bro I I
(42:16) like I said on my night panels every time I tell these girls the best bet for them of a guy is a good beta bucks man
(42:23) that's not going to leave them that doesn't sleep around that doesn't have access to multiple women and is just a
(42:29) good man that is never going to leave you after the child comes I GLA I really
(42:34) push for everything that you push for I really do I give probably the it doesn't sound like it no I do the problem is
(42:41) that I understand like I said that there's people in my situation or people in shitty situations baby mamas also
(42:47) like not even just baby daddies like me baby mamas too that did it wrong and they need help to to get back in line
(42:54) with whatever works the best for their life you know I really want my coffee at a
(43:00) perfect temperature okay go ahead go ahead man I'm sorry
(43:07) yeah yeah anyway but but no it doesn't sound like you are it sounds like you're
(43:13) saying that um I well I mean I get one aspect of it
(43:18) are you trying to kind of give a descriptor for problems so one of the broad reasons I like talking with red
(43:23) pillars and the manosphere people is I think they give excellent descriptions for issues it's the prescription portion
(43:30) of it that I have an issue with it's the prescription problem that I run into that I I that we really have the all
(43:37) these contentions with so I don't have any problem with you giving descriptors of societal issues and I think that that's God's work right we need more of
(43:44) that but when it comes to prescriptions that favor children favor the family can you give those to
(43:52) me and what you advocate for and what type of prescriptions you're moving towards yeah I I so the number one point
(43:59) of my show is to teach women red pill truths so then they can be hum better
(44:04) too because it's not good for just men to learn this [ __ ] women can learn these things too and become better also the
(44:10) number one thing I teach them is to keep their legs closed that's the number one thing because if they don't sleep around
(44:15) because if they don't sleep around it forces men to become better if women just stop tomorrow having sex with Chads
(44:22) and tyrones Chads and tyrones have to get off their mom's couch and go become Real Men of society okay so I do push
(44:28) women to the best person that they should choose do you think it's immoral
(44:33) for women to have sex outside of marriage uh I mean the thing is I just understand
(44:40) it happens is it immoral uh I don't know if it's immoral it's
(44:45) wrong it's bad if you said wrong and bad means immoral then yes I guess immoral
(44:50) what would you say makes it immoral just that they'll have worse outcomes if they do it's gonna be harder in their future the
(44:56) the Thai higher likelihood of having you know yeah yeah okay so it's going to be the outcome what about men
(45:03) yeah I definitely think sleeping around for men is bad as well that's why I preach relationships the whole point of my show being called Purple no I get it
(45:10) I get it I get it hang on before you go off on a tangent plugging yourself again we'll have plenty of time for that but when you're talking about these
(45:16) relationship Dynamics then you agree with me that it's immoral to be having sex outside of marriage
(45:22) I understand that the way Society works this is the problem today a lot of people don't want to be understanding by
(45:28) the way the under I understand that Society is messed up and people even like me have made mistakes and you can
(45:34) still come back from your mistakes negativity if you're a woman who's had 28 who's had a 20 bucks boys women and
(45:41) it builds men it trauma destroys women that's why we've May guard women for all of history here's the thing if you claim
(45:47) if you made the claim like you did in your opening statement which I have the note right here you said that trauma
(45:53) builds men and builds man's character you're saying that it does not do that for women that trial does not do that
(45:59) for women there's a higher I mean there's different types of trauma where we can talk about physical and crazy hardcore
(46:05) trauma and then we talk about you know a guy yelling at her all the time or her father being you know just a mean person
(46:10) yeah that's not my question though I'm just asking like just direct yes or no physically yes a woman that no no no
(46:18) because just verbal abuse and things like that I don't put that in the same category as physical abuse or grape if a
(46:24) woman has been graped or she has gone through physical abuse that is serious trauma for a woman and it can destroy
(46:30) their life in mind yeah but I mean if a man gets graped it can do the same thing I agree with you yeah so when you're
(46:36) talking about then the equalization of what you consider trauma which is character building for men wouldn't you say it's equally true for women no
(46:43) because this is why so a guy who goes through trauma we've always been disposable throughout all of history women have always been the vulnerable
(46:48) sex so we've protected them and men have always been the Disposable sex so if a man goes through trauma there's two
(46:53) routes he can go he's either gonna go the route where he becomes better and he learns from that trauma and he becomes the strongest man possible or he goes
(46:59) down the route where he's a piece of shin he's horrible and he becomes the worst man possible an addict or whatever and if he takes that route we don't care
(47:06) about those men of society they're disposable there's a reason why the suicide rate is as high as it is nobody cares about those types of men at all
(47:12) but I'm not understanding bro I'm not understanding though how this is tied into your trauma argument
(47:18) of if men go through trauma it builds character but if women go through the same types of trauma it doesn't build
(47:24) their character because a woman going through the same type of physical abuse like a guy would go through she's going
(47:30) to be way more women are emotional can you agree with me that men are logical and women are emotional I think that
(47:36) yeah for the most part I tend to agree yeah so so when women go through trauma they take it more in an emotional way
(47:42) and it's a lot more damaging because of them being an emotional creature it doesn't hit him the same way so then
(47:49) women generally speaking cannot deal with trauma as well as a man can deal with trauma that is yes that is my belief okay so
(47:56) you think then that men are there are characters built up by this trauma whereas women are destroyed by similar
(48:03) types of trauma which I'll even concede that this is true okay I just wanted to make sure I got your worldview correct
(48:08) now moving moving past that this begs the question then shouldn't you value
(48:13) women in a different way and if you value them in a different way isn't it a male's Duty then to make sure that
(48:20) they're not going through that kind of trauma absolutely so I I speak on this a lot
(48:25) men are supposed to make guard all women too make gardening isn't just for your spouse May gardening is what fathers did
(48:30) for their daughters what brothers did for their sisters yes we are absolutely supposed to protect and make guard women
(48:36) women don't want to be protected today so that's a little thing that's stopping that from happening all the time because they want to be men also but otherwise
(48:43) no I completely agree that we have to protect women and the best way to do that is I agree with you getting married
(48:48) and doing all those things once again we're in a post-merge society and that's just not happening so if that's true so then listen here's here's how we'll just
(48:54) tie this up so if that's true and it's our job to protect women and we have a duty to do
(49:00) it you are assessing that all of the power dynamics in society should move towards a patriarchal structure as the
(49:06) default there's no way around that after all men can go through this type of trauma and women can't women must be
(49:12) protected by men because women cannot protect themselves right so if that's true then overall the analysis from you
(49:19) must be that men are going to be the Architects and Arbiters of change right
(49:24) we have to be the Arbiters of change in The Architects of change absolutely brother so if this is true and we have
(49:31) to be the Arbiters and architects of change then why wouldn't we change the society in such a way as to modify the
(49:39) behaviors that we want to see rather than giving in to the society and allowing ourselves to become the same
(49:45) hedonist that you're currently preaching against
(49:51) because two things can be true at the same time oh man you you just walked
(49:56) yourself through the logic and still failed at the end of it no it's just very simple it's just that I can preach
(50:01) to these women to stop sleeping around at the same time I can understand as a male that is my best strategy to not do
(50:08) certain and here's the thing I want to get married I truly do want to get here you don't have a duty don't you know
(50:13) then you can't say I have a duty I have a duty to protect women and I have a duty to change the society into what I
(50:19) want but I'm going to shirk off this Duty for my own personal Hedonism you either have the duty or you don't have
(50:25) the duty how am I doing it for my own personal heroism explain you do you you think currently that
(50:32) these relationship Dynamics are not optimal between men and women you want to see these things change for the best
(50:37) values for men in general I would agree with that you want to see men have the
(50:43) best outcomes I would agree with that too what the way that you're not going to see them having the best outcomes is if
(50:50) you see the and the allowance of this type of promiscuous uh behavior from women the type of women who are not
(50:56) getting married who are incentivized to get divorced all of these are uh kind of
(51:02) contrary to the outcomes that you're talking about however men can collectivize according to you and your
(51:07) logic and mind which you just agreed with and we can actually put a stop to
(51:12) these kinds of of organizations on the underlying so we don't even have to deal with the surface problems anymore in
(51:19) other words we can make legislation to get rid of no fault divorce we can push men into positions of power where the
(51:25) patriarchy can actually make these types of radical sweeping changes you want to see in society in order to limit this
(51:32) kind of behavior why wouldn't you put all of your focus on that instead of saying I want to have my cake and eat it
(51:37) too I want to guard myself and take no risk even while at the same time I
(51:43) believe that I have a duty to protect women because the strongest point that I have
(51:50) to push behind the fact that the laws need to be changed is I'm one of the many men that want to get married very
(51:56) bad that want everything to be different to give more incentive for men to do that so buy it for you man
(52:03) so by me doing that and I'm telling you there's nobody else out here especially
(52:08) in the Redfield space and by the way the red pill space hates me because I preach relationships they hate me for it okay
(52:14) so you guys all hate each other yeah yeah like all you [ __ ] hate each
(52:19) other I don't know very very true but I've never seen any of you guys who ever get along I think I get along with Alex
(52:26) and we have some of the most conflicting World Views you've ever seen I feel like I get along better with him than he gets
(52:32) along with people who actually agree with this world view more than I do to be honest with you probably probably
(52:37) true but well it depends there's a lot of people I get along with but yeah there's a lot of like catty fighting and
(52:43) like little mean girl type of [ __ ] yeah he said that's about me oh yeah it's a bunch of clicks man it's because Rolo is
(52:50) a giant click and everybody tries to get on the Rolo train and it just causes everybody to suck on the teat of Rolo
(52:55) and that's the problem with the red pill space like they're all they all read evolutionary psychology just based off
(53:01) of what Rolo said evolutionary psychology is when you go read the Evo psych books yourself you'll get a whole different picture of it it's not even
(53:07) I'm dropping a video tomorrow where I'm gonna be uh uh going through about a dozen studies that they talk about all
(53:14) the stuff and most of the Rolo red pill Black Hill talking points are complete trash they're based on half truce and
(53:20) Alvarez well look I'm glad about it so I'm glad about some of these things that I hear out of your mouth I'm glad to
(53:26) hear that you're trying to tell women to be less promiscuous they'll have better outcomes if they aren't I agree with
(53:31) that I think it's totally true I agree broadly with a lot of the descriptors that you have but when we come to
(53:37) prescriptions I really don't understand why you wouldn't Focus all of your energy on Reformation of society to the
(53:42) benefit of all men rather than giving them a conflicting message which says Hey guard your yourself do everything in
(53:49) your power to not really participate whatsoever that just makes no sense to me you want the same prescriptions that
(53:56) I want here yeah yeah no it's more it's more of a strike it's more of a strike as a man of saying look until you all
(54:02) change this [ __ ] We're not gonna do this anymore we're not we're The Architects of change
(54:08) we're the [ __ ] we're the patriarchy we just go in we legislate this [ __ ]
(54:14) right we don't [ __ ] it we don't have to remember around and go on strike until women agree you know what I mean Andrew
(54:20) I have a guy who's a who's a mentor in my program okay who comes on my show often who ran for Senate here in Texas
(54:26) his name's Dr Mash how's Dr Matt rastami he's an eye surgeon I bring that type of
(54:31) stuff on I want the he's a married man he he literally pushes for his track
(54:37) cause as it gets he wants all these things to change too I'm pushing men to get into their City local governments
(54:43) nobody else is doing that telling them tonight but it's not telling them to not get get married tell them instead to
(54:49) find high value women to marry right but also but also shouldn't you be
(54:55) realistic and tell a lot of men too right that hey look you might want to settle because you [ __ ] suck there's
(55:02) a lot of men out there also and this is like kind of hidden outside who [ __ ] suck and probably should settle right
(55:10) all the time I agree with you I think men suck today I think women are sucky because the men suck I think the women
(55:16) would be great if the men were awesome because women fall into their femininity when the man is in his masculinity no
(55:22) men are masculine today so then come over to our Hang on we're almost there so come to the dark side the non-degen
(55:30) side get rid of this non-positive messaging which you have and instead
(55:35) Focus all of it uh throw it all on red man you know what I mean
(55:41) let's move Society towards what it is that we want to see no no the degens are
(55:46) way more fun stay with us I'm gonna do both bro if you ever if you ever want to check out my show what I do is I give
(55:52) birth one show where you told men to spray cologne on their [ __ ] car so that
(55:58) women would remember their smell so that was more likely to have sex with them later
(56:03) man that [ __ ] was lame that [ __ ] was [ __ ] lame dude you just called me you
(56:09) quoted one of the guys I support that listen let me try to bridge the gap here you guys are
(56:15) actually not far off at all but here's the big difference uh Sergio's position is that hey in an Ideal World an ideal
(56:22) Society marriage totally makes sense it's an ideal thing but we are not in that society and the way things stand
(56:28) now until there is change we can push for that change we should uh legislate for that change hang on I just I gotta
(56:35) cut in for just a second I'm really sorry Alex but my live chat just a second ago hit 404 which I feel like is
(56:41) a poetic number for you guys but anyway go ahead what's what is for you mean three or four that would be the
(56:46) president yeah it was at three or four [ __ ] [ __ ] it up see I that's that's I don't even understand the [ __ ] djend
(56:52) lingo anyway go ahead Alex I'm sorry okay yeah I just want to push the Gap
(56:57) again you guys are not far off so what Sergio is saying is that and correct me if I'm wrong about any of the Searcher is that Hey listen Ideal World marriage
(57:03) great idea I would support it and I think we should uh push legislation you know we should be political in order to
(57:09) make laws better and blah blah blah however at this current point in time the way things stand I think for the
(57:16) majority of men marriage is a dangerous proposition versus what Andrew is saying is like well no I still think that
(57:23) marriage is the even the way things stand now I agree with you that things could be better and we should push for that but even the way things stand right
(57:29) now marriage is a good idea for the majority of that that's that's that's the disagreement you guys can correctly
(57:35) I'm wrong about your position it's a good idea for the majority it's a good idea for almost every man I can think
(57:41) exactly as long as it's too as long as it's to a virtuous woman but to kind of Sergio's point I understand that there
(57:48) are less and less virtuous women to choose from I'm not disputing that that's true the kind of the Crux of my
(57:55) disagreement at this point is that it seems like Sergio agrees with all of my value structures agrees with the
(58:01) prescriptions that I'm after and things like this but on the other hand is also preaching towards men to not get married
(58:07) he's telling them he in fact he told me in DM specifically I want no man in to
(58:12) get married ever and when questioned here he says it's because we're on strike well no Sergey you don't go on
(58:19) [ __ ] strike you go out and you change the society like the leftist did that
(58:24) [ __ ] this whole thing up to begin with like the progressive communist did that [ __ ] it all up to begin with you don't go on strike and just let them continue
(58:30) their [ __ ] man well Sergio were you being hyperbolic or do you actually feel that uh no man should get married
(58:37) I think that there's always going to be beta men that are going to get married so we can't stop all men but if I could
(58:43) tell all men to stop doing it right now until we get some real change going oh yeah I would definitely say all men just
(58:49) stop right now until we get some real change going because right now let me let me try to bridge the gap but
(58:56) it sounds like earlier you were agreeing with Andrew that hey if you are one of those rare guys who needs a really
(59:02) virtuous woman I think for you big metric is body count who's a virgin she has all the values that you you're in
(59:09) favor love about it bro just low body account is good enough it doesn't even need I I teach guys how to find a girl with a low bike out I think that you can
(59:15) I believe I found a unicorn I believe I have a formula to find unicorns most
(59:20) guys don't though most guys use dating apps most guys go to church most guys go
(59:25) and just find women at the worst places possible and when it's the worst place to find women yes I think that the
(59:31) church is one of the worst places because you will find those born-again virgins those women the 30 40 and 50
(59:36) body counts that think I I actually see them all the time come on my show and I see them go to church on Sunday and then
(59:43) they're drinking Sunday night and Saturday night they were out the night before these women are not virtuous women they're not good moral women but
(59:49) they sit there and they act like they are because they go to church they go to church here in Dallas called social I think it's called social house and it's
(59:55) literally like a party bro it's literally like a [ __ ] club in there for me to bring up the Super Chat I was
(1:00:02) gonna bring it up later but uh this dude actually said something similar to what you were saying I'll just put that out
(1:00:08) there leave it at that uh okay anyway keep going Sergio no I I I lost track um
(1:00:13) but yeah I was just saying that the women the they're not the same at those churches man like I used to go to Anonymous the thing is Andrew I used to
(1:00:20) be a strong Christian when I was like 13 years old I used to go to Anonymous to get you back to that I want to go back
(1:00:25) to church I want to go and I want to go help the church become more patriarchal I do agree the thing is I'm a very
(1:00:30) biggest ass Sergio here don't listen to him no no don't let the
(1:00:36) devil on your shoulder needs to go away okay
(1:00:43) yes okay so I could at some of these points again I could make some concessions here for you Sergio uh I I
(1:00:49) do think that especially Protestant churches uh have become in in like the chatter says chatter makes a good point
(1:00:56) uh this is everywhere right feminism has infiltrated all churches everywhere finding virtuous women is tough but if
(1:01:02) you do find a virtuous woman we do you know you do realize we have to procreate right and if you're giving men advice to
(1:01:09) procreate outside of marriage you're necessarily advocating for bad outcomes
(1:01:15) I don't want them to do it mine was an accident I didn't plan to have my dog how are we going to sustain Humanity bro
(1:01:21) if nobody gets married it has kids how are you going to sustain Humanity Sergio I'm really scared of that right now
(1:01:27) that's my biggest fear in society is that we're not having kids so I would love for us to change the laws but if
(1:01:33) you're a guy that happens like I'm in I will help you out and get through that do you understand that you
(1:01:39) have too bad you have a really bad position here so you're saying I don't want any men to get married whatsoever
(1:01:46) leading to a worse outcome for a child yet at the same time you say we have to have the next generation of children
(1:01:52) right so you're setting the next generation of children up necessarily to have bad outcomes don't you understand
(1:01:58) how that's don't you understand that's bad yeah I got a question though okay I made a mistake I got a girl knocked up
(1:02:06) okay I I it was this was our first day I didn't know her that well it's very stupid very big mistake right everybody
(1:02:13) would say the worst way that you could ever do it right uh I tried to make it work I stayed with her for a year I wasn't in I was not in
(1:02:21) love I could not have I did not want to have sex I did not want to do certain things I wanted to I'd rather had sex
(1:02:27) with other girls I did not want to be with this woman for the rest of my life was it better for me to take my uh the
(1:02:33) the mother of my daughter serious and wife her and stay with her and then do what a lot of Christian men do which is
(1:02:39) she used porn use hookers or do I tell her the truth whereas I I don't fully
(1:02:45) love you I don't really enjoy having sex all the time with you I think it would be better for us to break up and you can
(1:02:50) find a man that truly loves you and truly wants to be with you and only have sex with you and then I can go find a
(1:02:57) girl that I truly want to be with more what is better what is better wait wait wait
(1:03:03) hang on I just gotta ask she did you guys have plans to get
(1:03:08) married no that's why I'm asking if an accident happens what is somebody supposed to do who has a bad situation like well first
(1:03:15) of all first of all come on it's not an it's not an accident you didn't accidentally [ __ ] the chick okay that
(1:03:21) was not an accident let's not uh shirk off our responsibility he didn't trip fall and slip into her vagina bro
(1:03:34) where like people like to ejaculate into things and then buy a plan B the next day because it's just like oh yes take
(1:03:41) the risk yeah it's fine and that was not your situation right that's not your situation you didn't accidentally lose
(1:03:46) my situation I bought the plan B and it didn't work like it like God had better plans for me God said you need to have
(1:03:52) this child and I had a child Plan B did not work so wait a second wait a second that's
(1:03:58) what I like to say is oh maybe I like to make the joke of no she probably spent the money on an eighth and Hot Cheetos
(1:04:03) but no I saw her take it okay so like things so backing up wait a second wait a
(1:04:09) second you had sex with a chick okay and your big brained plan was to give her plan B
(1:04:17) the next day because it makes you come better to know that
(1:04:24) this world is today bro so guys like me that like yes yes your entire ideology on the fact
(1:04:32) that you're into some kind of Kink play with Plan B and now you tell all men that they shouldn't get married you
(1:04:39) don't think that's a little bit [ __ ] insane no I'm just thinking
(1:04:44) I'm just saying that when bad things happen and they don't go the way that you plan them look I've done this a lot
(1:04:50) of guys okay who sleep around and have a lot of girls I'm gonna be honest with you bro sometimes they ejaculate in the
(1:04:55) women and then just buy a plan B after because they probably shouldn't do that then that's a good idea I a thousand
(1:05:01) percent agree with you but what I'm saying is that when those bad things happen somebody needs to be able to help
(1:05:07) those people when those things happen yeah I agree with that too usually that would be religion church family units
(1:05:13) for you know places like this things don't have the best prescription I agree listen again I can even agree
(1:05:20) with that but optimally those would be the support mechanisms that you would turn to I definitely wouldn't be turning
(1:05:26) to a support system that said well hey look bro I understand because I'm also in the Kink play and I tried this plan B
(1:05:32) [ __ ] one time because it made me come harder and it didn't [ __ ] work I wouldn't go to that guy for advice I can
(1:05:38) tell you that yeah I'm just explaining to you how how uh you know I was that guy bro like I
(1:05:44) lived in my city and I was that guy that did a lot of stupid yeah that's a really but listen man like as we're looking at
(1:05:50) you shouldn't make a societal prescription that every man shouldn't get married even to virtuous women in
(1:05:56) order to teach them a lesson because you were in Plan B cake play mode that's just [ __ ] nuts dude there's a lot of
(1:06:02) women though that get pregnant through the same exact method that I just said or something similar to that to a guy
(1:06:08) that they never met because inside of them yes they get pregnant the same way every time it's crazy isn't it it's like
(1:06:14) it's like we know how to prevent this 100 of the time isn't it yeah you come
(1:06:19) on their face I get it it's [ __ ] ridiculous it's so ridiculous man when these bad things happen what's crazy is
(1:06:25) that like in the Christian World though when this type of [ __ ] happens it's like oh you're horrible you should have never done that now you just need to stop
(1:06:31) having sex and not do anything bad but it's just like dude some people are already down your freaking lesson like
(1:06:36) what do you need to do to learn your [ __ ] lesson man
(1:06:46) well that was [ __ ] stupid you know you probably shouldn't be out [ __ ] a bunch of chicks or you might knock
(1:06:52) another one up and you're like damn those Christians and their stupid [ __ ] telling us not to do all this
(1:06:58) stuff that ruined our lives you don't understand I really want to be
(1:07:03) the next future I really want to be the next Nick Cannon and the only way I'm going to get that by just leaning into
(1:07:09) that [ __ ] bro yeah you got it you gotta put you gotta take your foot I think off the gas pedal
(1:07:16) a little bit here man and maybe reevaluate your priorities slightly so as you're looking at this try to
(1:07:22) understand you can't hat will walk around with a performative contradiction like I want the best outcomes for children but men shouldn't get married
(1:07:28) because that's going to lead to the worst outcome for children we're gonna have children we need them in society okay so maybe we can just take a more
(1:07:35) mild approach let's try this okay just instead saying no men should get married ever say that men should get married to
(1:07:43) virtuous women virtuous women can we just agree on that and then I'll call the debate good we'll
(1:07:49) call it good yeah I will I will I will say that for now on guys you you can get
(1:07:55) married but she needs to be a unicorn yeah virtuous there are virtuous women and they're not unicorns
(1:08:03) didn't you say in the intro that your two moms were virtuous women yeah they were great 40 years ago though the times
(1:08:10) are different now the times are not the same we do not have Richard you know were they always were your two moms always virtuous women
(1:08:17) I don't know what they were like in their younger years but they were virtuous mothers right there you ever virtuous as mothers but maybe not in
(1:08:23) their beginning years so it's like no I have no idea I didn't see them when they were young they're still virtue there are still virtuous women they're not
(1:08:29) unicorns and I think that's even saying that is ridiculous and saying hey it's Out Of Reach for everybody to find a
(1:08:35) virtuous woman I I don't even have a problem with you saying it's rare fine you can even say it's rare but it's not
(1:08:40) unicorn rare I just want to know where people go to find this though like I honestly want to know let me post this
(1:08:46) question real quick to both of you uh because I think it's gonna stimulate discussion what percentage of women in
(1:08:52) the United States do you think are virtuous just a ballpark you don't have to like 21.7 just a ballpark what do you
(1:08:59) think one percent no one woman
(1:09:08) what do you think it is I have no idea if I were to to give a guess on it uh
(1:09:14) how many women wanted to kind of follow virtues they would have to probably come from intact families for the most part
(1:09:20) and have but even then there's a lot of failure I would say probably very low
(1:09:25) very very low maybe 20 15 something very low okay okay let's let's actually way
(1:09:32) higher than I thought you were going to say when you said okay I'd say well if I mean women who follow serious virtues I
(1:09:38) think it's low it's not taught to them and there's no real expectation there's no expectation for women to be virtuous
(1:09:45) but there is still some societal expectation for men to be virtuous in other words I can't even though you and
(1:09:50) I have completely different World Views Alex no man would find it appropriate for me to stab you in the back right for
(1:09:56) me to do some [ __ ] up [ __ ] to you they'd say that's not virtuous whether they're a dgn or they're a Christian
(1:10:01) they'd both agree that that's bad you you know what I mean so I think I just feel like there's more pressure on men
(1:10:07) still to be virtuous and I do agree that we need to do something in order to start moving the Overton window so that
(1:10:14) we can have virtuous women I just don't think that the answer is to say never get married even to a virtuous woman and
(1:10:20) the other thing is I think that women can become virtuous over time you might you know what I mean you might get
(1:10:26) marriage young you might have troubles in your relationship there may but if there's no infidelity and there's no
(1:10:31) abuse and things like that virtue can come over time and work and effort and I think that that's necessary to
(1:10:37) acknowledge too is society [ __ ] up yes it's [ __ ] up I agree with you guys on all those descriptors but when it comes
(1:10:43) to prescription I want men to be taking action the political level and beyond in
(1:10:49) order to move men towards that process of let's start with no divorce and let's
(1:10:54) start with getting rid of these things and let's not give a counter message that uh men getting married is bad even
(1:11:02) if it's to a virtuous woman because we need to stand in solidarity to make these [ __ ] behave they're not going
(1:11:08) to behave there's too many Sims too many [ __ ] coomers too many pieces of [ __ ]
(1:11:13) you have to literally collect the Vibes and begin to legislate uh against porn and legislate against uh no fault
(1:11:21) divorce and legislate against these things that's what has to happen there's no other choice okay let me let me flip
(1:11:28) the question to sir what percentage of women do you think are virtuous depends what we're defining as virtuous
(1:11:34) but if it's like low Body Crown like not sleeping around like that was probably
(1:11:39) more to it than that right like being yeah well I mean all the other things but one of the big ones today like I
(1:11:45) would say the big problem that a lot of guys are bothered by is the body count thing because that means that she has no
(1:11:50) like she doesn't really [ __ ] and pride in herself like she doesn't respect herself so I think a lot maybe she has low self-esteem so a lot of guys I think
(1:11:57) are going to attach to that and if that's the case I think five percent I think five percent of women are actually virtuous and like the society is really
(1:12:04) pushing down the throat of 95 of women that you can sleep around you could do all this stuff and you'll be fine if we
(1:12:10) don't care about body count I agree with him that's true he's like he's right he's right about a lot of what he just
(1:12:15) said I don't I don't think that we find any disagreement there in fact I'm willing to uh call it good without
(1:12:21) beating him up about the head and shoulders any more than I already have with just this one little tiny
(1:12:26) modification that he made which is to say if there are virtuous women yes of course many should get married to them
(1:12:31) and we do need to have children you know like we that is an imperative that we do need to do that
(1:12:37) well what I'm worried about is the fact that guys make way less money now women
(1:12:42) are out earning men in major cities in some major cities um that's changing that's changing okay
(1:12:49) well but graduating from college though 60 40 um yeah that's good because men are good
(1:12:55) what you said is not true I actually just literally I'm gonna release this video in a few days of History interview
(1:13:00) where I went up to couples to ask them who makes more money 95 of the time the guy was making more money yeah so what's
(1:13:06) happened I would agree that that is the truth but what I'm saying is that that's why guys aren't getting into relationships and that's why guys aren't
(1:13:12) getting married today is because they're financially insecure a lot of men cannot think about marriage or making families
(1:13:17) and stuff when they're financially not doing good yeah but Sergio listen listen women have always done better in
(1:13:23) academics than men always yeah not history they've always they've always done better academically than men have
(1:13:30) they've always done better in college they've always done better in public school because the rules favor them so they've always done better in those
(1:13:36) categories however this kind of pay Gap that you were seeing is closing very quickly with trades men are getting into
(1:13:43) trades which is great that's fantastic because a good Tradesman can make more money than a medical doctor if they have
(1:13:49) the right trade and you you are seeing that Gap close very very quickly so even if women walk away with more Education
(1:13:56) First of all they're not walking away with more education walking away with a useless [ __ ] degree men are walking
(1:14:01) away being educated in a trade and that trade requires as much education if not
(1:14:06) more over time to become highly skilled at it so know the the Gap is beginning
(1:14:11) to close but not only that we should incentivize that even more we should incentivize men to get into trades even
(1:14:17) more uh so so kind of as I'm looking at this whole holistic picture I I think
(1:14:23) that overall you have probably a pretty good message if you could mix some morals in with it and stop being such a
(1:14:29) [ __ ] hedonist man and [ __ ] chicks and handing them Plan B and hoping it works itself out right like
(1:14:35) I support that but yeah I mean just just real quick I'll say this like I yeah we
(1:14:40) interviewed like at least several dozen couples over 90 percent of the time the guy made more money than the girl it's
(1:14:46) it was also remember you're in Miami though bro like uh like if I talk to girls here in my city a lot of my
(1:14:52) homegirls because I'm friends with a lot of girls that are bottle girl stuff like that a lot of them are doing better than their boyfriends they got really really
(1:14:58) nice sexy boyfriends but and they are you know the ones that make most the money um in their relationship so it
(1:15:04) really I think it depends really what city you're going to the type of people that you're talking to it depends if they want the frame in the relationship
(1:15:10) or not there's a I don't know I thought like that's a really hard one yeah I mean I don't know I've never done this
(1:15:15) in another city so I guess I don't know all right let's get into let's do a quick closing statement then I wrote
(1:15:21) down several questions for both of you and then let's do a open Panel so uh
(1:15:26) yeah let's go we'll go like two minute closing statement two three minute
(1:15:31) um I think since uh serger you went first then it makes more sense for Andrew to go first I believe that's John
(1:15:37) how they do it so give your closing statement then Sergio will give his and then we'll uh we'll get into the next
(1:15:43) part of the show all right so first uh Alex as always thank you very much for having me on your channel I really
(1:15:49) appreciate it and to all of Alex's audience even if you hate my guts thank you for suffering through another one of
(1:15:55) my debates I appreciate that very much uh over to my opponent Sergio you deserve every bit of the ash kicking you
(1:16:01) got tonight because uh essentially what you're what you're saying is cognitive dissonance and you need to really
(1:16:07) address this point but I think that just even with that one shift it'll maybe take you down the road of looking
(1:16:13) towards more viable Solutions than just telling [ __ ] skanks to stop spreading their legs all over town
(1:16:19) um that I I really do so I would I would kind of focus on that uh and then kind
(1:16:24) of the descriptors I don't see any problem with but start focusing on the
(1:16:30) prescriptors what are we going to do about this [ __ ] because the hour is late and time is limited and you only have X
(1:16:36) amount of time between General and I'd like to see even though the Zoomers are going to be all [ __ ] up as we know
(1:16:42) maybe hopefully the generation after them won't be and this is due to an installation of values and we're going
(1:16:49) to have to at least start legislating some kind of values or we're not going to have any [ __ ] value so that's kind of my closing and to my
(1:16:55) debate opponent thank you so much for coming out tonight as well and having this conversation I appreciate it uh surgery Europe
(1:17:01) no uh thank you Alex Rowe I really love the opportunity to come on here bro I really appreciate it a lot
(1:17:08) um Andrew great opponent bro I I love all your videos honestly I I look up to you a lot
(1:17:14) I think that you're a killer out there and I've actually used some of your talking points because I think that they
(1:17:19) are so powerful so no I really appreciate just having this debate with you bro it was great I need to get better at all these things so I'm happy
(1:17:25) that I even had this opportunity um at the end of the day the big thing that I want to say is uh no I I want
(1:17:31) everybody to understand if you've ever watched my show before I give biblical prescriptions very very very often
(1:17:37) especially when it comes to marriage and relationships because there is nothing better than the prescriptions that are
(1:17:42) in Ephesians or in Corinthians there's nothing that tops them sometimes so yeah I really do like to stick by those
(1:17:48) prescriptions I'm going to continue to do that for men though yes I might change it up a little bit I'm going to
(1:17:54) tell guys that they need to be good and not cheat on their girls and be good men in their relationships like I do in my current relationship I don't believe in
(1:18:01) me going and sleeping around or spinning plates or having side chicks or anything like that so I'm gonna continue you know
(1:18:06) doing good relationships because I believe that's what we need I mean if if marriage is really hard for us right now
(1:18:11) we need to at least be in [ __ ] relationships the way I see it because we don't come together and at least team up we're definitely not going to save
(1:18:18) enough money or buy homes or do any things that we really need to do if we're stuck single like the powers that be want us to be powers that be really
(1:18:23) wants y'all to be single because that's how they're going to profit the most so yes I just want everybody to come
(1:18:29) together um I want everybody that's Andrew's age or older Andrew how old are you real quick 39 39 I want anybody in that
(1:18:36) generation Gen X or Boomers um I just hope they get their head out I'll be a millennial by the way oh
(1:18:43) you're a millennial that's dope so you're like me oh well I didn't know that that would make you a millennial but for Gen X and boomers are just
(1:18:50) people that are older I'm 32 so just older than me honestly I'm really disappointed um the world is the way it
(1:18:55) is because the oldest generation of men didn't [ __ ] do anything they let all this [ __ ] [ __ ] happen they just sat
(1:19:01) around and wanted a profit and pillage off of the younger women and younger men and make money off all this hedonistic
(1:19:06) [ __ ] so [ __ ] all the older guys I'm pretty ageless sometimes because I think that we wouldn't even be in the situation if it wasn't for that
(1:19:13) um but no I really hope all the older men you know stand up and start doing stuff like Andrew and actually trying to
(1:19:19) push for things to change because if we don't have older men that actually try to do anything like this we're definitely not going to move the needle
(1:19:24) we're definitely not going to change any laws we're definitely not gonna have any change in the [ __ ] at all so yeah I
(1:19:30) would just uh that's all I have to say I really appreciate you though Andrew you're a great [ __ ] you're like an awesome person to go again Andrew's like
(1:19:36) how the [ __ ] did I become an older man yeah well the I would like to get one
(1:19:42) clip just for my channel if you don't mind nothing big but from both of you
(1:19:47) can you say happy birthday Mela Florida uh mellow what melaforta
(1:19:54) happy birthday Mela Florida happy birthday Mela Florida we
(1:20:00) appreciate that appreciate it uh so anyway so I wrote down a few fairly challenging questions
(1:20:07) for both of you guys uh and then we'll open up the panel it's not too many so here's the first question
(1:20:13) this one is for both of you what is the body count cut off or serious relationship if everything else is
(1:20:19) perfect about the girl so a meaning like she has she seems like she is really great girl like no red flags purely
(1:20:27) green flags super supportive super loving uh everything you want in a relationship what is the most in a
(1:20:33) hypothetical that your her body count could be before you were considered being a serious relationship with her
(1:20:39) let's start off with you Sergio so I like to say that a guy should have
(1:20:44) three times the girl so if she has a five I think he needs to have around 15. and the reason why is because of social
(1:20:49) calibration a woman from the age of 16 or even say 13 up to 18 or 20 is going
(1:20:55) to have way more opportunities of men coming up to them pursuing them talking to them teaching them social calibration
(1:21:01) to the point where they're very used to dealing with men how to subliminally talk how to move how to do everything
(1:21:07) and so a girl since has higher Social calibration at a younger age usually or with fewer Partners or you know with
(1:21:14) fewer people I think a guy should triple that if it um if he doesn't so if if a guy has a body count of like 300 then he
(1:21:21) can a girl with 100 is fun no I still so like like I I have a
(1:21:26) strong prescription of of under 20 is like like I don't think because the stats show over 20 is so bad I think
(1:21:32) over 10 is really bad I think over five is really bad but the bottom line is you're really going to get lapse brain
(1:21:37) on you say if she has 10 and you have 10 or if she has 20 and you have 20. I
(1:21:43) think that her experience and her social calibration is going to be higher than that man so to just have an insurance to
(1:21:48) just have a little you know for just in case he should try to Triple her just so it's more likely to be in his frame I
(1:21:55) think the relationships are always a woman's frame if she has a higher body count usually but up to 10 right not
(1:22:00) past 10. yeah I really don't want guys to go over 10 honestly like five honestly is the best but how many guys
(1:22:06) are gonna find a girl with less than five probably none um five is the average body count of women yeah so
(1:22:12) that's it's actually a lot more common than you would think but um what it what if hypothetically speaking that guy he
(1:22:18) worked in uh sales or um some job that forces them to
(1:22:23) constantly socialize and his social social skills were top-notch he did uh
(1:22:28) you know he was a presenter he did presentations all the time he's an actor whatever and his social calibration was
(1:22:34) like way higher than the average girl in that situation would then it be different you don't need the three to
(1:22:40) one rule yeah probably not because he's more socially calibrated I'm saying this in general for most guys that aren't
(1:22:46) socially calibrated today which is most of the young under 25 guys I think they all have very low social calibration
(1:22:51) okay so your number okay gotcha uh Andrew where do you stand on that do you even have a number yeah so optimally uh
(1:22:59) one second by the way hang on this will only take
(1:23:07) Andrew's on PornHub I was getting his coffee bro yeah I was looking at some Plan B Kinks over on PornHub no I'm
(1:23:14) kidding yeah anyway so the the question of Body Count is complicated I'll agree
(1:23:20) with that optimally I think that the correct body count for men and women is zero for marriage that's that's what I
(1:23:27) would advocate for but Aaron true we're talking about I know I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about both okay so let me qualify
(1:23:35) it with this okay once the sanctity though of this is broken once the virginity uh is Boom or bust for either
(1:23:41) the man or the woman uh that that virtue of Chastity is essentially gone at that
(1:23:47) point from from there none of us are perfect people are going to [ __ ] up kids absolutely like we all know that this
(1:23:53) [ __ ] does happen Okay but I would still look more importantly for women who are
(1:23:59) virtuous who have stopped doing the skanking around sledding around things like this so I understand that there is
(1:24:05) an intuition for men and myself included that if you have a lot of sex with a lot of different men you're not very
(1:24:12) valuable and most most men don't want you and you would have to adjust your expectations accordingly so I guess the
(1:24:19) more I thought about it since the last time I was asked this question for my own personal preference like what would
(1:24:26) be the the limit of Body Count before I would never get married to a woman ever
(1:24:32) again I think it would be five okay I think that that would be my limit
(1:24:38) for for marriage would be would be five now again this is completely
(1:24:44) preferential and just intuitive I have no data to back this up whatsoever okay
(1:24:50) uh just it's just preference point so I'm but I am not saying though that uh
(1:24:56) women who have a higher body count than that or men who do can no longer be virtuous because that's insane to me I'm
(1:25:02) just saying from my perspective okay yeah that's fair I mean five is the average body count of a woman in America
(1:25:07) so you know you're basically yep like your answer is totally fine okay so here's the follow-up portion of both of
(1:25:13) you uh so you know when it comes to the uh you know you don't want a girl with a
(1:25:18) high body count because she's more likely to divorce you uh it's always the the uh Institute for family study study
(1:25:25) that's quoted which shows that women who have a higher body count are more likely to uh get divorced right that's that's
(1:25:32) the study that everyone is operating off whether happiness also is the other one no well
(1:25:37) there's multiple studies well that's that's that's typically the main one that uh people talk about so do you
(1:25:43) think when it comes to body count and risk of divorce it's a correlation or causation meaning that a girl who has a
(1:25:49) body count of 30 she's more likely to have other traits that make her more likely to divorce the guy or is it the
(1:25:56) fact that literally like getting 30 dicks in a girl somehow changes her brain chemistry and she becomes more
(1:26:02) willing to divorce the guy or changes her personality so that's that's the question for both of you uh whoever
(1:26:08) wants to try first you think it's a correlation causation or you think it's some combination of both if you think it's a combination uh which one is more
(1:26:15) important yeah so environment and genes are going to play a part in everything for everybody so if you come from a lot
(1:26:23) of this has to do with upbringing initial upbringing and environment I think so if you come from broken homes
(1:26:28) things like this you can see the correlate there between promiscuous behavior and non-promiscuous behavior or
(1:26:34) what you would call body count just from the roots of where you come from the more [ __ ] up your home life is the
(1:26:39) more likely you are to engage in high risk behavior male or female so I would say that the environmental factor is
(1:26:45) massive in this instance however if you're coming from a well-to-do
(1:26:51) um highly religious home who has good roots you might misunderstand the question or I I think you must
(1:26:57) understand the question I I understand that uh like a lot like whether a girl is to have a high body count that can be
(1:27:04) uh environmental and genetic right but that's not what I'm asking I'm asking the link between the force like the the
(1:27:11) chance of the woman divorcing you and her body count do you think that is purely correlative or do you think that
(1:27:18) there's actually a causation thing here like when a girl goes out [ __ ] a bunch of dudes that makes her more inclined
(1:27:24) just through that action to divorce her Future Husband by us both that's my point is that it's both
(1:27:30) environmental and genetic so there could be genetic indicators which would move a woman towards that type of thought
(1:27:36) process the more men she sleeps with whereas other women could have genetic indicators where they would not they
(1:27:42) could have what you would call like a very promiscuous lifestyle give it all up and not give a [ __ ] about it so
(1:27:47) there's going to be a genetic and environmental cause for both of these so I I don't think that it's purely causal
(1:27:53) and there are other correlates there as well so you think it's a combination of correlation and causation correct yeah I
(1:27:59) think it's a combination of both absolutely and I don't think that that's even uh something which is that heavily disputed
(1:28:06) um I mean I think you're probably you might be right but I I do think there's some
(1:28:12) people who disagree with you on that uh do you think one is like more prevalent than the other do you think it's more
(1:28:18) correlative or more causative I think it's more causative okay the more the more men or the more
(1:28:25) men a woman sleeps with the less her inhibitions to continue to sleeping with men become and the reason that I think
(1:28:32) this is because they also uh feel like they're broken Goods or things like this and they it seems like once the Genie's
(1:28:39) out of the bottle to have less restraint on that behavior I think of it like I do a crack addict right if he's two months
(1:28:45) into smoking crack right what's another three months all right it's like once you're already once you're already in it
(1:28:52) it seems like it's way harder to stop it so I do think that there's a massive causation effect there and I also would
(1:28:59) take those other factors into consideration now when you say uh it's more causative do you mean like 60 or
(1:29:06) like 90 just a ballpark uh it could it could be as high as 95 percent uh I don't I don't know but I
(1:29:13) would say yes far past 60 percent yeah okay it's larger process all right Sergio same question
(1:29:19) yeah um I really think that a woman that's that
(1:29:26) though the more people that she sits around she's going to have that mentality of one foot in one foot out I think that it's a habit you know kind of
(1:29:33) like uh the drug addict like once you sit there and you've done this so many times it's not gonna feel um or not I guess it's not I don't
(1:29:39) really actually see it I don't know I honestly it's really hard I kind of
(1:29:44) feel like Andrew on this one where it's kind of more in the middle it's just well Andrew's not in the middle he feels
(1:29:51) as partially positive but correlate there's an element of correlative but he thinks it's mostly positive
(1:29:57) yeah and I would probably say exactly the same I think that a woman that gets to that point she's going to have one
(1:30:03) foot in and one foot out it's going to be really hard for her to stay in the relationship because she's experienced so much other [ __ ] she's it's going to
(1:30:08) be Alpha widowed I truly believe Alpha widowed is a thing maybe it's not Alpha widowed in the sense that there's one guy she's always thinking about but
(1:30:14) maybe she's like thinking about this guy that was the best kisser this guy that was the best dick this guy that took her on the Dubai vacation like it I think
(1:30:21) that she can get up to a point where it's really hard for her to accept a normal lifestyle or a normal man you
(1:30:27) know the higher that number goes up to because she's going to be thinking of memories it's the book or it's the tree of knowledge I think once once they bite
(1:30:34) that fruit um and once they have that taste of of what it's like to do those things I
(1:30:39) think it's really hard for a woman to come back to walk it back that's why I have a very dead set you know if she has
(1:30:46) a high body count you shouldn't even try because I don't think that there's anything that can fix that okay you guys
(1:30:51) have a pretty similar opinion on this so here's my follow-up question um if it is causative or causative as
(1:30:58) you guys say why is there a dip after two so just for anyone who's not familiar with this uh the way the chart
(1:31:05) looks is there's like zero the risk of divorce is like eight percent then we go to one it's like
(1:31:11) fourteen fifteen percent and then when we go to two it jumps up to like 25 27
(1:31:17) but here's something that really interesting happens when we go through three four five it actually dips by like
(1:31:24) five or six percentage points and doesn't actually come back to where it is at two until you get to like nine or
(1:31:30) ten body count which is very interesting so I guess I remember I actually remember this coming up previously so I
(1:31:36) went and I took a look and it turns out that that's an older study that's old data and if you look and adjusted new
(1:31:44) data it almost is precisely along the lines of body count and I'll send that
(1:31:49) over to you via text message right now so yeah so there is an adjustment
(1:31:56) um which has happened from there so hang on I do have a reference to this but you got to give me a few minutes to pull it
(1:32:01) up here Alex okay that's fine uh we can move on to the next thing I have a question actually for Sergio so this
(1:32:08) will give you time to uh uh to pull that out oh and I should be really curious to see that if you have that
(1:32:14) um so all right Sergio so do you think it's a moral for a man to have like 30 sexual partners
(1:32:21) I think it's not going to be healthy for them mentally I think that men can still get messed up from sleeping with too
(1:32:27) many women it'll get you in the habit of wanting to be that type of guy is it immoral
(1:32:34) we go back to what Andrew said you know is a moral bat you know bad is immoral then yes I think it is bad for you to
(1:32:41) sleep around too much I think that we live in a world though where a lot of guys um are going to run it up like I've been
(1:32:48) saying a lot it's going to happen anyways so we have to find Solutions around that well hang on let's clarify
(1:32:53) that is not immoral so like for example Andrew smokes cigarettes but that's not immoral that that's sub-optimal and
(1:32:59) that's bad for yourself and you can make the arguments like bad for his like family in a way because you might be
(1:33:05) more prone to lung cancer but it's there's nothing immoral right so we have to separate those immoral is like acting
(1:33:13) like acting in a way that you know is immoral like causes harm to society causes harm to someone right so uh are
(1:33:20) you saying that it's just bad for men to have 30 social Partners or it's actually moral no I just think it's it's more
(1:33:27) it's just bad for him I don't think it has anything to do with moral like I really believe that a guy can be in a
(1:33:33) marriage I'm not condoning this I'm not saying it's the right thing to do but I think that if a guy cheats in a marriage as long as he's not having an affair
(1:33:39) like he goes and gets his dick sucked or something stupid like that and or like a girl comes onto him and does that I
(1:33:46) don't think that should destroy the family unit I don't think it should destroy the nuclear family because I think men and women are completely
(1:33:52) different I think when women cheat it's way worse than when a man cheats as long as he's not having an affair I think it's really bad if he has an affair like
(1:33:58) if he sits there and he's given a lot of research smoking cigarettes injuries like yeah you reminded me uh no but but
(1:34:06) Sergio but so so I'm sorry like I just wanted I know it's not immoral I don't
(1:34:11) think it's immoral I just think it's bad for him no I don't think she I don't think a guy having a high body count or even
(1:34:17) cheating can be in moral unless he's unless he's having an affair that is definitely immoral you're screwing over your wife completely having an affair
(1:34:23) and I think everyone here would agree with you on that obviously it's immoral to cheat on your partner uh but we're
(1:34:29) just we're just talking purely about the body count so you you just think it's bad it's not immoral then by that logic
(1:34:35) is it immoral for a woman to have a 30 body count that's a good question I think that it's
(1:34:42) definitely immoral for the woman to have a high body count because sex is different for women than it is for men I think evolutionary contrary that's a
(1:34:49) contradiction man I was actually waiting the whole time
(1:34:56) so yeah let's do it well so like why is it immoral why is it not immoral for the
(1:35:03) man but immoral for the woman what specifically makes a moral for the woman because we're hardwired differently men
(1:35:09) and women's Brains are literally different even three weeks after birth where like you can see Brian's can't see that men and women are completely
(1:35:14) different okay so if we just can establish that you know we're not blank Slaters men and women are completely different then we can also establish
(1:35:21) them possibly how you know high possibility that sex is completely different for us I'm still not going to
(1:35:27) say you know it's awesome for a guy to run up his count or anything like that it's bad for both of us to run up our counts but as far as immoral when a
(1:35:34) woman sleeps around it's definitely different but like disease literally want to be in a cold wet place like that
(1:35:41) vagina like it's not healthy it's not good for society there's nothing good about women sleeping around syphilis has
(1:35:46) literally this is destroyed this is equivocation though you guys are actually talking past each other Alex he
(1:35:52) doesn't even understand what you're talking about when you say moral he doesn't know what that means and it's not a dunk on you right
(1:35:59) well because you said moral is good and then he's telling me that moral doesn't hurt others so what do we want to say
(1:36:05) you can't really so you can't really make these claims you can't say unless you had some grounding or
(1:36:11) something to base this on what Alex is alluding to is he's saying listen you can't say it's moral for men to go [ __ ]
(1:36:16) 30 women but it's immoral for women to go have sex with 30 men why would one be
(1:36:22) immoral and not the other that's literally a very contradiction
(1:36:28) unless of course you can point out something specific about a woman having a high body count that makes it immoral
(1:36:36) right yeah but it would have to make it immoral that I I don't know how you'd ever bridge that Gap well that's that's
(1:36:42) the one I'm trying to figure out right now so you said that women's Brains are different everyone agrees with you on that what specifically about a female's
(1:36:49) uh biology makes her having a high body count immoral she's hardwired to understand that she
(1:36:58) has to protect her vagina she is hardwired to know this and and men are
(1:37:05) hardwired to want quantity women want the best quality men want quantity it's
(1:37:10) always been that way throughout all of history and the only thing that's tamed us over the last six thousand years was religion that's the only reason why
(1:37:17) we're okay only read it for a long time I can make
(1:37:24) this way easier way easier for you okay you would agree with me that men are far
(1:37:30) more hardwired to murder than women right of course violence yes right okay
(1:37:35) so is it less moral than for a woman to kill a man or murder somebody than a man
(1:37:43) it's not less moral but is there more situations so it's not more or less immoral so why
(1:37:49) in that case well no no actually I think that back it could be because because the thing is if she's doing it to
(1:37:54) protect herself because like if she stabs a guy who's beating them the word murder means unjustified
(1:38:01) killing so if a man if a man is unjustified and killing and a woman is unjustified and killing
(1:38:07) they're both murderers is one more immoral or less immoral than the other and I think the answer would be no right
(1:38:13) yeah no okay so if that's true how in the world could you just say because the
(1:38:19) natures of them are different which you're reasoning out here you're saying the nature of men is that they murder
(1:38:24) more and the nature of women is they murder less but you hold both of these moral standards as equivalent right
(1:38:31) because then when it comes to this sexual morality you hold them as unequivalent which makes no [ __ ]
(1:38:36) sense that's not how morality Works actually it makes perfect sense because it's called apples and oranges they're
(1:38:42) two completely different [ __ ] things how can you compare murder to somebody sleeping around something like real life
(1:38:50) something that creates disease it creates life it does all types of other things you're comparing that to somebody
(1:38:55) being murdered when people say apples and apples listen when people say apples
(1:39:00) and oranges you don't really understand what that reference is for the reference of apples and oranges is to say that
(1:39:06) what do I compare an apple to in order to get you to understand what an apple is without an apple I would say it's
(1:39:12) like an orange right that's an analogy so when I'm using an analogy nothing's
(1:39:18) ever going to map on equivalent to anything else ever that's why it's an analogy so when sometimes they're off
(1:39:24) the equivalents that's a false equivalent but that's that's it you could say something is a false
(1:39:30) equivalence but in this particular case I'm not saying that they're equivalent I'm saying that the analogy for the
(1:39:35) moral standard is equivalent let me give you a different analogy that might make more sense do you think it's
(1:39:41) immoral for people to be overweight no but we are hardwired as humans to be
(1:39:49) healthy and want to like not be fat right like no we're
(1:39:55) hardwired to be animals we're monkeys and we can get addicted to anything we we are not hardwired to be healthy at
(1:40:01) all like uh if we can get addicted to anything then that woman is just getting addicted to
(1:40:07) casual sex so why is it immoral because usually that casual sex probably
(1:40:12) came from trauma to young women become hypersexual if they were graped or anything like that that's the problem is
(1:40:17) like no demand enough that guy started eating a lot
(1:40:23) because he was he had a bad childhood too bro men do the same thing if men if men are the victims of sexual
(1:40:29) molestation especially younger in life they also become or can become hyper promiscuous from that just like women
(1:40:35) the nature is no different there yeah I just think that one is definitely more damaging to society than the other one
(1:40:42) that's all I'm saying I definitely think that a woman who sleeps around is going to ruin what the reason why Adam and Eve
(1:40:48) I know that you're a fundamentalist so you take everything in the Bible literal but uh you don't know what you mean by that
(1:40:54) okay I'll just trolling you bro but the bottom line is that the the whole story of Adam and Eve the whole reason why
(1:40:59) that was even the Torah thousands of years ago is because the analogy for if women fall to Temptation we both fall
(1:41:05) out of Eden we both do men and women are both screwed if women sleep around so it
(1:41:10) is just worse if women do it they are supposed to be pure just like how men are strong people hang on hang on you
(1:41:16) can make the argument you can make the argument that's worse for it's worse uh
(1:41:21) for me like a um effects perspective if women have more casual sex but that
(1:41:27) doesn't mean that it will be immoral right it's not good for society that like [ __ ] 60 of our country is fat
(1:41:34) but that doesn't mean it's immoral to eat fast food I I feel like I I don't I
(1:41:40) think we might be talking past each other like Andrew said but if you're saying that you're not talking you've
(1:41:45) just caught somebody in cognitive dissonance Alex and this is what it looks like when somebody's suffering from cognitive dissonance it always
(1:41:52) seems like they they're making no sense and don't understand you he does understand he just can't reconcile this
(1:41:57) that he can't do it and so is it funny that the gigian is much nicer than the religious person but anyway so that
(1:42:03) aside I'm not being mean I'm just pointing out what's obvious to everybody okay anyway so so uh Sergio you said
(1:42:11) that um what's it called it's not a moral for someone to be obese right and then when I ask you well what's the difference uh
(1:42:18) why you said well people get addicted to anything even fast food I was like okay well what if that girl got addicted to
(1:42:24) random dick oh well that came from trauma so but then I said after that
(1:42:29) well what if that uh that person got addicted to fast food as a result of trauma he hadn't as hot in his childhood
(1:42:36) would then that be moral if the guy who eats McDonald's every day had some trauma in his childhood
(1:42:42) yeah no I I don't think it's the same because of it's a false equivalence to me like I think that we're comparing
(1:42:47) things that are so drastically here what are we allowed to compare it's so different than than somebody who is
(1:42:53) overweight you can't get away with this [ __ ] what are we allowed to ever compare can we make any comparison
(1:43:00) I love those analogies okay so so if we can that's all we can do we can but
(1:43:06) they're different things Sergio I don't understand they're different things so we're not allowed to compare them we're not allowed to make analogies
(1:43:14) this is actually why there's such thing as the Bible is because there's so much Nuance to [ __ ] and they had to go into
(1:43:20) detail and descriptives and prescriptions into heavy detail and nuances that that argument doesn't sway
(1:43:27) me because I don't believe in the Bible so that's like more for argument for Andrew but uh can you can you explain to
(1:43:33) me why it's not a like it's a false question you're honestly like you're honestly convincing me of the moral
(1:43:40) argument that there is nothing moral about it I just a personal view though for me that I think that woman has bad
(1:43:46) morals if she does I think that a guy who sleeps around because we're hardwired that way because for a hundred
(1:43:52) thousand years as Homo sapiens we were hardwired to want quantity and then women were hardwired by your
(1:43:58) evolutionary standard to kill each other and you think that's immoral don't you understand like this is this is It's a
(1:44:04) silly argument you can't just say because the nature of a thing is that you do the thing but you don't have to
(1:44:11) do the thing then that means you must do the thing that's insane it makes no sense what is like what what is like how
(1:44:18) the world is that's all I'm saying it is not a requirement of the world that you
(1:44:23) [ __ ] a woman to give her plan B the next day
(1:44:28) hardwired to do that Sergio yeah I think we're kind of going circles
(1:44:33) here but my father is I feel like you either gotta say that um having high body count is immoral for
(1:44:40) both men and women or it's uh it's it's not immoral for either you can say it's
(1:44:45) worse if men and women were blank slates I would a thousand percent agree with you but we're not blank slates men and
(1:44:52) women are completely different we're hard everyone understands that men and
(1:44:57) women are different because of that that's why but what's specifically about a woman
(1:45:05) being different makes it immoral the one thing you said is that she's hardwired
(1:45:10) uh not to sleep around even if I grant you that right uh you know if we go off
(1:45:15) what Andrew said like people are hardwired to do all kinds of things that they do but then you wouldn't say that's
(1:45:21) immoral like you wouldn't say someone who murders someone because they're prone to rage is moral because they have
(1:45:26) that hard wiring you wouldn't say that someone who got addicted to uh you know fast food is is immoral because uh you
(1:45:33) know he's hardwired to do that so it seems like the hard wiring doesn't actually mean anything well actually I don't think we're hardwired just kill
(1:45:39) people me wrong there's a person sociopath or a psychopath yeah but it's
(1:45:45) just hardwired you're not doing anything immoral most people are altruistic though most of society has gotten to the
(1:45:50) point that we're at because of altruism well there's actually a good point if you're born if you're born uh a person
(1:45:57) with borderline personality disorder okay and you don't have whatever this altruism is are you doing anything
(1:46:03) immoral by killing somebody without justification if you're born with a cluster B disorder what if you're
(1:46:10) born or without altruism one of these outliers you're talking about and you
(1:46:16) become some like Psychopathic murderer are you doing something immoral
(1:46:21) well obviously everybody in society it's about how we what we all see it as and we would also morals are just the
(1:46:27) collective of society so then if this Collective of society decides that men having a higher body count than women is
(1:46:34) immoral then that would make it immoral right Sergio yeah and there's a lot of people who agree with me and would say
(1:46:39) that isn't moral for women to sleep around oh I can't believe it Andrew said something different he
(1:46:46) didn't say what you responded no I said if Society decreed that men having a
(1:46:53) higher body count than women made them more immoral than women you would now have to bite the bullet that they were
(1:46:58) more immoral because Society said so okay Society loves men that sleep around Society worship that's not we're not
(1:47:05) yeah on the descriptive is we're on the by your logic if Society determines what
(1:47:11) is moral and what is not moral then if Society determines that women being [ __ ] is moral and Men uh you know even
(1:47:18) having sex once is immoral then that would mean mean that it is right Sergio yes I go by what is yes what Society
(1:47:26) thinks and Society thinks we all judge people based off of these types of things
(1:47:31) it's okay to have sex with dead bodies would you say that that's moral then
(1:47:37) um I guess we're kind of going into ethics at this point aren't we no no it's just a basic basic question
(1:47:43) if Society said it's okay to dig up your Grammy and really give it to her is it
(1:47:50) okay to insert you can they run a whole train on your dead Grandma Sergio because they all
(1:47:55) collectively said that they could is that moral Sergio oh my God this grandstating is hilarious
(1:48:01) this doesn't y'all don't even make any sense no aren't even answering this question so answer it
(1:48:07) dude it doesn't make any sense it's such a false equivalence it doesn't even make any sense
(1:48:13) let me try to explain this in a nicer way and I will move on right after this but uh the the reason for the question
(1:48:20) for the hypothetical is to test your logic and the best way to test your logic is with extreme hypotheticals
(1:48:26) because those are the ones that really drive the point uh across right so
(1:48:31) that's why he's asking that so you made an earlier point that hey I go off uh when it comes to like what's moral I go
(1:48:37) off what Society standards are and what Andrew's trying to prove is that hey that I don't think that's true because
(1:48:43) if Society decides on some really [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] you know you would not be in favor of that or maybe you
(1:48:50) would I don't know but that's the point he's trying to make that's why so I answered my question if Society wanted to dig up Grammy and run a train on her
(1:48:57) because they collectively decided that was the most moral thing to do would you say that that was right or wrong
(1:49:02) or moral or immoral obvious obviously it's immoral but the problem Society doesn't dictate morality it's just silly
(1:49:08) we're living in real are we living a reality or some crazy ass world like y'all oh you think that realities don't
(1:49:13) exist where people are sacrificed gods and their hearts are cut out on temples and [ __ ] like that because they existed
(1:49:19) bro and by the way right this second there are societies which act in immoral ways which you would disagree with even
(1:49:24) though they have collectively decided to do so and that's exactly it's about what the majority of people think and I'm
(1:49:30) sorry that society says most people in society think it's it can't be about what all people think otherwise Grammy
(1:49:37) is going to have a really bad [ __ ] time right messenger bro I'm sorry that that a lot of other people think the way
(1:49:42) that I just said that it's immoral for a woman to see around but not a man I'm sorry I'm curious like most people think
(1:49:48) that that doesn't make it true if by your standards if those same people hang on Sergio listen my turn if by those
(1:49:54) same standard those same people says okay to dig up Grammy and run a train on her you say that that's immoral but they
(1:50:01) can make the determination on it whether or not not other forms of sexual morality are immoral because you happen
(1:50:06) to agree with them or not that's insane bro no what's insane is doing false
(1:50:11) equivalents over and over again and thinking you you don't even know what a false equivalence is tell me tell us what it is what's a false equivalency
(1:50:17) you're you're you're literally trying to equate that because you're trying to equate murder to [ __ ] like a woman
(1:50:24) sleeping around or men and women sleeping around it doesn't make sense you cannot hypothetical to testing
(1:50:30) no no Sergio he's not doing that like I trust me I constantly argue with Andrew
(1:50:36) and if he was doing that I would definitely call it out but he's not that's not what he's doing he's using a hypothetical to test your logic right
(1:50:42) that's what I'm not look I'm not here to beat him up anymore on this right he's not prepared for that conversation and
(1:50:48) that's fine I'm fine with moving on from this we're kind of beating Grandma's dead corpse at this point
(1:50:55) that one bro I'll give it to you if y'all want to die on that Hill y'all could die on that Hill I'm totally fine
(1:51:00) with that one um okay so here's the last thing I wrote down uh you said uh Sergio you said I
(1:51:07) think actually I don't know if both of you guys agreed on this but I think I heard you say the Sergio benderological women are emotional
(1:51:13) um so my follow-up question to that is who do you think gets angry more men or women
(1:51:18) uh I think probably actually women really okay you think women are more
(1:51:25) prone to uh rage and anger yeah I think that they're just less prone to show it
(1:51:30) okay interesting I think a young man um might be more emotional sometimes if
(1:51:37) they're not if they haven't learned if they were raised by single like today they're raised by single mothers or um anything like that uh I definitely
(1:51:44) would say I can be honest and say in my early relationships I was more emotional than I am now the relationship I'm in
(1:51:50) now and how stoic I can be and who's more emotional in my currently definitely my girl but it's because I have the frame and I'm sure sure
(1:51:57) never fall down to her level and on any of those things but when I was young oh yeah your girl [ __ ] tested you you
(1:52:04) [ __ ] you yell right back or something you know when you don't know better you haven't read you know meditations yet or
(1:52:10) anything like that a lot of guys or they have they don't have good Role Models teaching them how to be good stoic men
(1:52:15) and not let their women you know drag them into a into a gutter like that I think that there are men that are emotional but they just haven't learned
(1:52:21) yet okay I like women are more prone to all emotion I I agree with everything okay Andrew you did answer the question
(1:52:28) so serger I agree with everything you said but that as actually besides the point what I'm asking you is if we take
(1:52:34) men not just you but then as a whole as a collective and women as a collective right who do you think which category do
(1:52:41) you think will be more prone to anger more prone to violence well violence is actually not an emotion it's a it's an
(1:52:47) action but uh it you know comes from anger generally speaking so what do you think is going to be more prone to anger
(1:52:53) uh is it going to be men or women a thousand percent man okay there we go so then by your logic so Andrew believes
(1:53:00) something different which is fine but by your logic then would the statement not be men and women are emotional in
(1:53:06) different ways not that women are more emotional like anger is an emotion right if men are you know way more emotional
(1:53:13) to woman I mean if men are way more Angry than women then it just seems like men and women are emotional in different
(1:53:18) ways but to kind of back up Serbia Sergio
(1:53:25) here just a little bit just remember that lesbians have the highest domestic violence in the United States period out
(1:53:31) of all categories lesbian domestic abuse in women's domestic abuse is much higher than was
(1:53:37) previously thought so it could it could just be possible that women are much
(1:53:42) more prone to uh being prey to their emotions than men are generally right
(1:53:48) now I'm not I'm not sure that I would say that they experience anger in far greater quantities but I do think that
(1:53:54) they're more prone to all of their emotions than men are that's just just kind of my take uh yeah the I I do think the lesbians I
(1:54:03) I'm not familiar with that statistic but I'll take your word for it I do think the uh lesbians might be a little bit of
(1:54:08) an exception I think for a variety of reasons I think number one like it's a very small percentage they're women
(1:54:14) cohabitating and [ __ ] women cohabitating hate each other that's why I think also like if I'm just being if
(1:54:20) I'm just being honest and serious I think that like in a lesbian relationship like one of the girls is
(1:54:26) like you know the butch or whatever right and so like that that's not your
(1:54:32) average female that's not your average like feminine girl that's like a very yeah they're d-gens masculine well no
(1:54:39) but there's a lot of like feminine degence though right like they're like you could yes be feminine but so what
(1:54:45) I'm saying is those are not like your average feminine girls they're actually very masculine they're they're adopting
(1:54:50) a lot of man masculine traits which I think is what probably causes you know a
(1:54:55) lot of [ __ ] like that yeah but I mean that's not going to change their physiology even if they're trying to adopt the
(1:55:00) traits they're not like taking hormones or anything that's going to mess with their physiology so thing is is like ultimately I just think that women are
(1:55:08) much more enslaved to their emotions than men are now that's not to say that there's not a ton of the demographic of
(1:55:15) men who aren't enslaved to their emotions either I just think that they're less less prone to them on
(1:55:21) average than women are that's all I'm saying yeah I think my position on this which I've said many times I think that
(1:55:26) men and women are emotional in different ways I think human beings in general are largely emotional I think a lot of these
(1:55:33) red pill podcasts Lop around like oh we're so logical but then they're like have like [ __ ] temper tantrums all
(1:55:39) the time I think as a man and as a woman you can become you know very logical and you can you know through meditation
(1:55:46) through all the practices you can like gain like largely control of your
(1:55:51) emotions you know I've done that seems like which sex do you think is more prone to doing that
(1:55:57) um in terms of taking that road probably meant probably men why do you think one would be more inclined to do that if men
(1:56:03) were just as much enslaved because because I think there's more benefit for men to do that what's the benefit so the benefit they
(1:56:11) have that women wouldn't have the the benefit is that you will uh for men it's a lot harder to get girls and for girls
(1:56:18) a lot easier to get men so for the men it will improve your success with women it could potentially improve your
(1:56:23) success with work and stuff like that so yeah I think there's more benefits than a woman generally gravitate towards
(1:56:28) different careers wait that makes no sense because a woman had good self-control then she would be
(1:56:34) at less risk for the promiscuity which then makes her less desirable for men so why wouldn't it have an equal amount of
(1:56:40) benefits for her to have self-control because of her own behavior as well I didn't explain that because a woman who
(1:56:46) has even has a body count of 30 40 50 it will still have a wazier time getting a
(1:56:51) boyfriend than a guy who who's perfect in every way but not the high value men they want
(1:56:57) uh yeah that that the whole high value man thing is largely uh overestimated women generally speaking when it comes
(1:57:03) to long-term relationships they don't actually value looks uh it's uh there's no correlation there they look at guys
(1:57:10) that typically look at internal factors um altruism being a big one uh so
(1:57:15) confidence is another one Charisma so yeah so like women um what's it called for for short-term
(1:57:22) sure but for long term uh being a high value man is like it doesn't mean nearly as much as the red Bill Community talks
(1:57:28) about and that's backed up then oh yeah I'm gonna I'm gonna drop a
(1:57:33) video tomorrow that like shows the I know a lot of people in the chat don't like this but this is backed up by studies again I I thought there was an
(1:57:40) element of truth to it but uh it turns out there's not but anyway so the point we'll have to see your studies
(1:57:46) well you haven't sent me yours yet I mean I'm still waiting on that
(1:57:51) well we I was busy answering your questions but here you go I actually have it in front of me okay okay anyway
(1:57:57) so uh so Sergio wait so I'm going back to you so according to your own logic
(1:58:03) then if men are way more likely to be uh Angry then would you not agree that men
(1:58:09) and women are both emotional just predisposed to different types of emotion
(1:58:19) I guess uh yeah I would have to agree with you men are more likely to go angry and women or more like to go south it
(1:58:25) just depends man like I really think because I'm looking back to my own relationship I'm looking back to the things that I go through like myself I
(1:58:31) would say that a woman can be more emotion like I said if the guy is Young and he has no
(1:58:37) experience the problem is that there's women like when I was 18 19 20 years old losing my virginity again my first
(1:58:42) relationship that girl was running laps on me with social calibration if she already had you know a 10 body count I
(1:58:48) only had one or two she's gonna really have the frame of the relationship she's gonna kind of drag you down into hell
(1:58:54) like she's gonna always bring you down into that childlike emotional state so
(1:59:00) it's all about the social collaboration she can be younger than you but if she has more bodies than you she has a
(1:59:05) higher Social calibration than you I really think it's the women that get angry first that drag the men into
(1:59:11) becoming angry don't be wrong I can get stressed out and maybe laugh because he got popped the tire or he doesn't have
(1:59:18) the money for a bill and he's pissed off about it like I think a guy can lash out because they're angry about something but I think a majority of the time the
(1:59:25) woman is angry about something that she wants the guy to do she's [ __ ] testing him in some way and she's dragging him
(1:59:30) into an emotional state and most guys fall for that sit all day long because there's no counselors there's nobody
(1:59:35) helping men in these type of situations teaching them how to be stoic how to not have these things happen to them in
(1:59:40) their first few relationships yeah surgery everything everything is like a dad in the home everything is everything
(1:59:47) you're saying is correct you're 100 right about everything you just said but that is still that's kind of like a
(1:59:53) different uh point I just think that the women are more emotional like I will say though that the women are more Angry
(1:59:58) though so like a guy can get more Angry he's more physically violent he's more physically capable of being more more
(2:00:04) you just said that meant that women uh that men are more uh what I said do you
(2:00:10) think men are more angry and you said thousand percent I think that they can get more intensely
(2:00:16) angry by the way as far as a timeline goes like over a
(2:00:23) long period like we're looking at guys entire life like from you know his dating life starting at 18 all the way
(2:00:29) up to 60. I think that and then we put a woman on the same scale 18 to 60 that he's with the whole time and we judged
(2:00:35) how often she was angry or how often he was angry in that 40 Years of them being together I would say that it's we would
(2:00:42) have a chart showing the woman got angry more often than the man but at the start or when he was younger I would agree it
(2:00:48) just depends what age bracket we're looking at if we're looking at a young age bracket then the guys definitely get more Angry if we're looking at the whole
(2:00:55) bracket it's women do it more if we're looking at just the later life it's definitely women that get more Angry
(2:01:00) okay Andrew by the way it's private so I had to request access so you have to grant me access to the Google Doc
(2:01:06) um yeah I mean I think that like my position on this has been pretty consistent I think that uh then a woman
(2:01:12) who produced supposed to different types of anger I mean different type of emotions I think that uh you know like
(2:01:18) if you look at for example stupid crimes it's like predominantly like vast
(2:01:23) majority of it is committed by men like stupid [ __ ] like [ __ ] driving away from a cop when you have like nothing
(2:01:29) really to be worried about or someone in the face or committing assault all these stupid crimes predominantly committed by
(2:01:36) men uh women generally don't do that women are predisposed to other types of motion like you know like being sad and
(2:01:43) crying and stuff like that so yeah I just I always found that to be like a red pill cop out when they sell oh men
(2:01:49) men are logical brand women women are emotional Brill at the same time like these people are literally like the most
(2:01:54) emotional people I've ever seen but anyway that's just a side point oh we can we can we can move on from this we can get to the
(2:02:01) um bring some people on and then we'll wrap up let me read one Super Chat because I want to go pee really quick is
(2:02:08) that okay yeah it's okay you don't need my permission uh okay let me see if there's any he
(2:02:15) needs to go call his two dads and two moms real quick come on Andrew that's really nice women
(2:02:22) are emotional because of hormonal levels each month therefore women or emotional come on dude uh women do have swings in
(2:02:29) hormones but that in of itself like for example if you look at me yeah you can
(2:02:35) check testosterone like my testosterone is super duper high right like you would think if you just look at my like
(2:02:41) hormones that I'll be really really angry or supposed to anger or like have flip outs I don't I'm like probably one
(2:02:47) of the most common people you guys have seen right so there's not always freaking out right now bro you need to
(2:02:53) calm down oh uh okay uh most of the priests and
(2:03:01) pastors are feminists don't hold the woman accountable men or Harleton high standard but women are giving free pass do you agree with this injury yeah
(2:03:08) okay I don't disagree question for Andrew how can things shift
(2:03:14) right culturally oh man
(2:03:20) that's a that's a difficult question and it would literally take me 15 minutes to
(2:03:25) give a um kind of an overarching explanation but you can't actually shift culture
(2:03:31) right it is Shifting right anyway because uh otherwise conversations like this wouldn't even be happening but the
(2:03:37) Overton window has been subtly moving back to the right uh the pendulum always swings within the Left Right dichotomy
(2:03:45) so I'm not looking I'm not looking necessarily for um some kind of overnight uh plan but I
(2:03:52) do want to start getting people at least mobilized in the political spectrum and starting to move that direction at the
(2:03:59) very least rather than just kind of accepting that this is the way things have to be but most of my plan relies on
(2:04:06) the Next Generation and the generation after them with a strong installation of values knowing that the birth rate
(2:04:12) crisis though apparently there isn't one if you listen to uh Alex and vosh the
(2:04:18) other night
(2:04:25) I never said that there's not declining birth rate in the west of course there is and actually lovely
(2:04:32) if you look at globally what's happening is their population is increasing but
(2:04:37) the birth rate is not doing too well right and that a lot of that is because people are living longer right so uh we
(2:04:44) have to separate population you know with the replacement rate
(2:04:49) yeah so if the replacement rate goes down what's going to necessarily happen to the population well it seems like
(2:04:55) according to all the predictions with the exception of that study you send me is that it's going up and up and up okay so you think that we can have a lower
(2:05:02) thin replacement birth rate but still have the population increase
(2:05:07) um I think it depends on what what level like what level no no no listen the longer the longer people possible it's
(2:05:14) impossible it's Alex it's impossible for us to have less than replacement rate
(2:05:20) bursts and still have a population going up is there any possible way you could
(2:05:25) justify how that could be possible I'm about to answer you the the level the replacement birth rate rate like what
(2:05:33) that number is is 1.86 like it is now or is it how many people do you need
(2:05:39) that's the answer 1.95 will depend on how long people live and a lot of
(2:05:45) factors like that how many infant uh mortality rates like how many infants die at Birth like there will be other
(2:05:52) stuff that plays into that number and that will swing it up or down
(2:05:57) Alex I just want to make sure that you're on record saying that you think it's possible to have a less than
(2:06:03) replacement birth rate and still have the population continue to climb no of course not I've never said that okay so
(2:06:10) then the global population if we have a lesson replacement birth rate necessarily is going to do what
(2:06:18) uh if we have less than the replacement birth rate then it will ultimately go
(2:06:23) down but I'm talking about but you're missing the point that I'm trying to make which is that uh with advances in
(2:06:29) technology and like less infant mortality that you know we can have less kids and still have so the the
(2:06:37) replacement birth rate not possible can't change let's say we lived until we were one
(2:06:43) thousand years old but the birth rate was less than the replacement rate for
(2:06:49) all human beings on planet Earth even if it was 1 000 years old for our life rate could you possibly explain to me how it
(2:06:55) could be that you would maintain the same population do you think that if we
(2:07:01) completely eliminate inferred mortality that the replacement birth rate would not decrease
(2:07:08) what in the [ __ ] world does that have to do with anything well it actually that's the whole point I'm trying to
(2:07:13) make like dude one more time okay replacement
(2:07:19) rate is less than the population that you have to replace them with regardless
(2:07:25) of how long we lived how could you maintain that population Alex do you not understand that the
(2:07:32) replacement rate will vary based on certain things that happened with uh with science and technology and Medicine
(2:07:38) why is this such a hard [ __ ] question do you think okay do you think like if we take somewhere like Africa where
(2:07:45) there is just I'm just throwing a number out there a 25 infant mortality rate and do you think if we somehow eliminated
(2:07:52) that and become zero bad by default would make the replacement rate go down
(2:07:58) by a little bit well no it will make the birth rate go up the info the replacement rate that's
(2:08:05) what I'm trying to say yeah so the the birth rate would then go up but since we have a less than replacement rate for
(2:08:12) our birth rate let's assume for a second let's just assume for a second you and
(2:08:17) your wife lived until you were 1 000 years old but you only had one child who
(2:08:23) will also be slated to live until he's 1 000 years old when you are dead are you
(2:08:28) going to have more people or less people that you have created less people now answer my question do
(2:08:35) you think the replacement rate can can be altered by things like uh you know uh
(2:08:42) getting rid of child mortality or eliminating it that would bring the birth rate up yes the birth rate rough
(2:08:49) but it would also lower uh the um the replacement birth rate
(2:08:56) what the [ __ ] are you saying listen Alex listen so then that one kid that we see that
(2:09:03) one kid that you have that would have died yeah yeah so if it was gonna stay so that that one so the levels are the
(2:09:10) same and that one kid only then had one kid and then that kid only had one kid and that kid only had one kid no matter
(2:09:16) how long the generation before them was alive the population necessarily is
(2:09:22) going to go down because it has to there's no there's no possible way around that ever
(2:09:31) to raise that birth rate so that that no longer happens okay I'll just try to explain this one
(2:09:38) more time so if if couples so right now I believe the replacement birth rate is about 1.86 or something like that
(2:09:46) 2.1 it needs to be in order to have replacement say that again it's what so it has to be at 2.1 in order to replace
(2:09:53) the population okay you have to have a kid and your wife has that so you have to have two kids with the woman in order
(2:10:00) to replace you and replace the woman okay I'll just I'll just take your word for all that I'll grant you all that so no no no no you don't have to take my
(2:10:07) word Alex you would agree that you need to have one child to replace you and one
(2:10:13) child to replace the woman you have children with right yeah sure okay so then anything less than that is not
(2:10:20) replacement levels okay so if you're at 1.8 is that less than two
(2:10:26) okay so uh sure I'll grant you all that so let's assume that
(2:10:31) um we're living in the 1800s and like 40 of uh babies who are born don't make it
(2:10:39) past the age of one because we have high infant mortality and let's assume that through medicine
(2:10:46) and no one dies right the the little the little babies don't die then me and my
(2:10:52) wife don't have to have quite as many kids to to uh have an adequate replacement
(2:10:58) rate are you not following this well what you're saying is I just want to let
(2:11:03) you know this that you understand you're saying that if less babies die that
(2:11:08) means the birth rate is higher than replacement rates okay but if more baby dies you be you become under the birth
(2:11:16) rate replacement level which I would agree with what in the world that has to [ __ ] do with whether or not the
(2:11:22) population necessarily has to decrease if you don't have enough people to replace you and the person you're
(2:11:27) replacing uh the girl then uh your population necessarily will have to go
(2:11:33) down there's no one plus one still does equal two there is no way around that
(2:11:40) the whole point I'm trying to make is there's a little bit more to it than how many kids people are willing to have how
(2:11:47) many what else is there how many of those kids survive well then that would bring the birth rate up
(2:11:54) right still would have to go up above two Alex right but I'm not arguing against it I'm
(2:11:59) just talking about that there's more than how many kids we're talking about two different things uh you're talking I'm talking about how many kids uh how
(2:12:07) many babies people are willing to have you're just talking about the birth rate but well they need to have enough babies
(2:12:12) to go past replacement levels which is two right that's how many they gotta have
(2:12:17) I'm not disagreeing with you on that obviously yeah so so every woman who
(2:12:23) currently exists on planet Earth would have to have two children in order to
(2:12:29) compensate for the number of women and men currently on planet Earth sure yeah this would be offset by some
(2:12:36) women having four and some women having six and some women only having one right
(2:12:42) but that's why we have the average of how many they're having and right now they're having less than that too which
(2:12:47) would be necessary to replace them in the person who impregnates them yeah sure that's all fine it just seemed like
(2:12:54) you were disagreeing with me about the importance of uh or the significance of
(2:12:59) infant mortality being uh eliminated and technological well that would just bring the birth rate up but you know infant
(2:13:06) mortality is extremely low now well no it I don't think that would actually would that actually bring the birth rate
(2:13:12) up yeah if more babies survived past X it would have to necessarily bring the
(2:13:18) birth rate up because yeah babies who are alive past birth well what if that
(2:13:23) baby dies in like nine months or a year well then you would have to adjust so
(2:13:29) when you're talking about infant mortality rates I think that that's up to seven or it used to be up to seven that they considered it up to before
(2:13:36) they consider that an infant uh death and yes infant mortality rates have always been factored in to your
(2:13:43) population levels and the birth rate so but right now it's extraordinarily low everywhere everywhere basically on
(2:13:49) planet Earth I mean infant mortality is uh I mean it used to be I think in the
(2:13:55) 1800s when this was uh beginning to be recorded I think that it was as high as
(2:14:01) like uh four on average per woman it was like insanely high but now it's not it's well in personal countries it's really
(2:14:08) low but in uh third world countries it's still extremely low in third world countries too really in fact there's a
(2:14:14) first world nation the United States has one of the highest infant mortality rates on planet Earth wait that's yeah that's definitely in
(2:14:22) terms of out of like first of all countries it's up there but it's like out of all countries or you say that no
(2:14:28) not out of all countries I said in the west so in the west this we have the some of the highest infant mortality
(2:14:34) rates but when you're talking about even globally um this is not something which is uh
(2:14:39) which which is an overwhelmingly big deal anymore when it comes to infant mortality
(2:14:44) not if you compare it to like the 1800s and 1900s early 1900s things
(2:14:51) like this you see that as the birth rate goes down also infant mortality is going down right alongside of it
(2:14:58) oh I'm looking at this right now huh yeah
(2:15:04) and it's definitely gone down I don't know I would need to look into this more again soon
(2:15:09) um it's like one percent yeah the worst countries okay it's a lot of space with those
(2:15:16) yeah okay I didn't know that I thought it was higher honestly uh all right let's move on uh
(2:15:23) it's basically no more Super Chat so let's move on to uh people on the call
(2:15:28) okay uh hello hey what's going on guys not much man hello
(2:15:35) hey so I had uh two questions for purple pill podcast in my opinion it seems like
(2:15:40) you guys that have come after Kevin Samuels popped off to me it seems like you guys just have these circular
(2:15:47) conversations where you guys do not represent the past all the full-blown sectors of the space when has your
(2:15:54) podcast brought on and who have you brought on from the mgtow or the black pill sector wait real quick Andrew you
(2:16:00) still have to give me permission to for that document you sent me yeah I don't know how to do that exactly
(2:16:07) you you will have an email just check your email and we'll say Alex I can't check my email at the moment but I don't
(2:16:14) know exactly how I'm supposed to do that anyway go ahead but I'll make sure that you get it so that you have it for
(2:16:19) future reference yeah uh so I've had on quite a but you said mgtower black
(2:16:26) pillars so I'm extremely against mgtow and black pill I hate them the most of anybody else on the internet if anything
(2:16:33) that's what red pill is is a bunch of black pillars in mgtow and that's why it's so stupid is because it's a it's a
(2:16:39) convoluted group of nothing but those type of people um so I don't like to bring those people on I've had mod on I've had Sterling
(2:16:45) Cooper on I've had like a lot of the red pill guys on if you consider those guys black pillars or mgtow then I guess I've
(2:16:51) had some of them on but I don't think those guys are black pillow at all or mgtow I had good talks with Sterling on and off camera about relationships he
(2:16:58) agrees with me on a lot of things about relationships same with MLD MLD when he came was the was really all about
(2:17:03) relationships as well um every person that I've had on the Pearl was the one person that really
(2:17:08) disagreed with me on a lot of stuff I had Pro on my show and we disagreed on a lot and right now we're having a Twitter war against each other we disagree
(2:17:14) online I went on Rollo show and debated him I disagree with Rolo on a lot of [ __ ] I disagree with Michael Star even
(2:17:19) though me and Michael Sartain are the only two people that teach pre-selection I disagree completely with the way that he teaches pre-selection he's sending
(2:17:26) guys to the fire the way that he does it um yeah I don't think I've had black pillars and miktail on wait you you
(2:17:32) missed the big person you had me on that was the most important yeah I had Alex I thought we were talking about live
(2:17:37) people you know like actually like in person which Alex you gotta come to Dallas bro what the hell man guy come to
(2:17:42) Dallas okay but but the problem is it isn't about agreeing with those guys are disagreeing with them because it doesn't
(2:17:48) mean I agree with them or disagree with them necessarily but the point is you guys day and night y'all have the same
(2:17:53) type of discussions that stems from what I call the Kevin Samuels version of The Red Pill which is this hyper Folk focus
(2:17:59) on traditional hypergamine it's just like an endless well of the same type of conversations you guys have day and
(2:18:05) night that's number one and then number two I'll ask you another question you can take the mic number two the other thing that I've noticed on all these
(2:18:11) different podcasts and it doesn't really matter what the percentage is 95 98 but it's well over I would say it's well
(2:18:18) over 80 percent but you guys seem to have a really hard time y'all don't even try to bring in guys and I'm not talking
(2:18:24) about myself forget about myself because I've been in and around the space for a decade but you guys seem to have a real
(2:18:29) hard time bringing in people from the old guard that would bring in different perspectives and different arguments rather than the circular conversation
(2:18:35) you guys have in other words if I didn't know y'all's names of y'all's podcast I wouldn't know any difference between y'all's podcast and I wouldn't know any
(2:18:42) better whose podcast it is because y'all's conversations are so similar so in your in regards to your show when do
(2:18:47) you bring in guys from 10 years ago seven years ago six years ago well before Kevin Samus popped off which was
(2:18:53) December of 2020. when do you do that so when I got into this space bro it was
(2:18:58) about a year ago I got into the whole manosphere thing probably about a year and a half ago I started this channel a year ago I didn't live on the internet I
(2:19:06) never got on the internet to look up how to get girls use Pua I always just had a fine time with Social Circle Game I
(2:19:12) didn't even know it was called Social Circle Game I had to learn all this stuff I don't even know these guys that you're saying that seven ten years old I
(2:19:18) don't even know the guys that you're probably talking about the only person I know that's an old guy in the space is like Rolo I know there's that other guy
(2:19:24) that he hates like John Anthony lifestyle like I know that there's certain Pua people and stuff like that but I will never bring up anything that
(2:19:30) is Pua because I don't like pickup artists if that's what they're doing as pickle bars or if they're old people that are teaching red pill stuff I hate
(2:19:36) them the most Rolo's group and all of his little old men that suck his teeth I
(2:19:41) hate those guys the most because they don't have experience especially experience right now I'm a 32 year old
(2:19:47) who's lived with multiple girls I've been in multiple relationships all with younger women I'm very like the way my
(2:19:52) lifestyle works I have a lot of experience to speak from and on obviously it's not always going to buy
(2:19:58) any good to go by anecdote but experience is everything for a man I think experience is way better than
(2:20:03) talent in every shape okay but here's the problem with what you're saying part of the purple pill is red pill in nature
(2:20:10) red pill and blue pill you don't get a purple pill without the red pill and blue pepper you don't know what purple pill like why
(2:20:16) my channel is called Purple Pill it's called purple pill because AMS which I like AMS a lot because he was one of the first people in the space that I got
(2:20:21) into he says purple pill is being a red pilled person in a relationship so everybody hates me because my channel is
(2:20:28) called Purple Pill pod they're like oh you must be a mixture of red and blue I'm not I'm a very red pilled person I really believe men need to have the
(2:20:34) frame of the relationship I really think that relationships are best when a guy has red pill knowledge and understands
(2:20:39) female nature the best he can so no I definitely think it's good for you to have this knowledge in a relationship or
(2:20:45) else you're going to get finessed Sergio Sergio you said you hate poas do you hate me no I love you because you're
(2:20:52) like the Pua that is the coolest bro come on I mean I'm just I'm just not a big on pickup bro like I think it's
(2:20:58) something that you need to have but it's one percent of the equation like I think that you need to have that but like just to sleep with a girl is one thing but to
(2:21:04) lock down a hot young girl where she wants to be in a relationship and she wants to be in your frame in the relationship that's a whole different
(2:21:10) ball game like I think Pua doesn't teach that and like I think Pua does a great job of getting you in the door and all
(2:21:16) that stuff but I still think that Social Circle Game runs Laps on Pua all day long like like if a pickup artist can
(2:21:23) get a girl like five or ten percent that is this close rate my clothes raise like 50 60 70 because I don't even pursue
(2:21:29) women they they're coming to me they're already have burning James Liar they're already coming into my frame it's a it's
(2:21:35) a way different ball game like those two things are so opposite okay but here's the problem the underlying logic of what
(2:21:41) you're saying is that the guys in the space that we didn't come to space with experience a lot of guys say what I'm
(2:21:46) about to say but I know it's a god honest truth I came into space with a bunch of experience with a bunch bunch of different women different cultures
(2:21:52) different social economic backgrounds different ages so I didn't come to the space to look for information whether other people do that or don't do that so
(2:21:59) the underlining logic of what you're saying is that the guys from the past don't know what they're talking about if that is true then why did we produce
(2:22:05) Kevin Samuels at the end of the day the dude got talking points from the entire space different races different social
(2:22:11) economic backgrounds from different blogs different books roller tomasi uh Tom Leykis the radio show from the 1990s
(2:22:17) you Kevin Samuels doesn't become Kevin Samuels without those talking points forget about the background forget about the suit forget about any of that stuff
(2:22:24) the the inclination of okay him being a high status high value man none of that stuff matters without the elite talking
(2:22:30) points the the same traps that women would walk into night after night thousands of women which is he hung the
(2:22:37) hype pergamy carrot in front of their face knowing full Alex I'm sorry to cut you off man
(2:22:43) um but Alex I'm gonna get out of here for the night uh if you're you got other people coming on the panel to fight
(2:22:48) about because I I literally don't give a [ __ ] about any of this if this is like what's going on over here no there might
(2:22:54) be some questions for you um let's limit it to I mean if you have to go I'm not going to keep you but
(2:23:00) let's limit it to maybe two more minutes for a night uh just so we can get
(2:23:05) through everyone okay well let me just ask the Andrew a question since before he takes off just just to summarize what's your position on the manuscript
(2:23:12) I'm just kind of curious because I kind of get lost in the sauce and the religion stuff what's your general perspective good bad or what what do you
(2:23:17) think I think that most of the people that I've heard talk in the manuscript are complete [ __ ] degenerates
(2:23:23) um and they don't represent uh any of the values that I push for whatsoever
(2:23:29) but I do think that they're they're highly useful in one way which is that often the descriptions that they have of
(2:23:35) problems I find to be accurate just not the prescriptions to the problems
(2:23:43) yeah I mean that was pretty much it I mean I I generally agree with that but I think yeah uh in terms of purple pill I
(2:23:50) guess I'll ask them a question and I'll get off the panel and he can take it where he wants to take it if you just kind of had to summarize in two minutes
(2:23:55) how would you teach a guy to vet women for sexual attraction which in my opinion if there's no sexual attraction
(2:24:00) there should be no marriage but a lot of people they really don't care you know how it goes yeah I know how the saying goes I really don't care if the woman is
(2:24:07) there as long as she's there I don't believe in that other guys do so how would you teach a guide about for sexual attraction it's a very simple
(2:24:14) did she come to you is she working to be to be with you is she coming into is she does she have burning desire is she uh
(2:24:21) coming into your frame is she pursuing you I don't think it's good for guys to chase at all I think it's a low
(2:24:26) self-esteem move for a guy to chase validation with women in any way shape or form um I think that you need to give the
(2:24:32) initial approach or the initial show that like you you like them or something like that but afterwards I'm big on
(2:24:37) friend zoning girls I friend zoned the [ __ ] out of women I think that's actually easier to get a girl when you act super cool and you friend zone them
(2:24:43) because they're so used to guys being pick up artists and just trying to [ __ ] them or just trying to sleep with them so when you do the opposite it actually
(2:24:49) ends up working more in your favor if I flirt with anybody it's a bunch of old women at the grocery store I don't I
(2:24:55) don't sit there and uh and flirt with women all day long unless they have Bernie James desire for me and they're
(2:25:00) showing that well did he drop off I thought I thought he was he was in agreement to do more people what the
(2:25:06) [ __ ] well now he said he was going to take off no I know but then I was like yo uh
(2:25:12) we're gonna get more people he's like all right cool and then uh I'm just pleased I'm just pleased Andrew that
(2:25:19) wasn't very christ-like that wasn't very christ-like Jesus if I was doing a live
(2:25:24) stream with Jesus he would have stayed on until the very end I know that uh no
(2:25:30) maybe he just had a tech issue and he's coming back um okay anyway so did you have anything
(2:25:36) else tonight I don't want to hog the mic I mean I'll let uh all right cool thanks for coming on
(2:25:42) buddy all right let's do we got two more people backstage and uh
(2:25:50) there he is you know I was uh I was on the verge of uh going tangent and uh
(2:25:57) yeah about how no no no I just I just pushed the wrong button that's all that's right we do have to remember
(2:26:04) Andrew is an older man you know it's uh it's a little different they didn't have technology when he was a kid you know he
(2:26:10) was an older man yeah um let's bring on two more people and then
(2:26:16) we'll wrap up all right so first one hello okay so I do have some things I
(2:26:23) want to ask Andrew but um real quick I don't really understand why this confusion surrounding the idea
(2:26:28) that if you don't have babies you're not going to replace the population that you have it seems like like that that's kind
(2:26:35) of like expecting to get more gas in your gas tank without putting gas into it like I don't understand how even if
(2:26:42) you brought in immigrants you're still losing the population of people that you
(2:26:47) have in your country and you're you're kind of like kicking the pan down the road do you even know
(2:26:54) geometry bro what do you even know geometry wait I don't understand what what is
(2:27:01) that I think I think Andrew actually he's he's agreeing with you Andrew it
(2:27:08) sounds like yeah well real quick hang on before he finishes the point I had one quick question for Sergio just real
(2:27:14) quick Sergio how would you feel if you didn't have breakfast this morning if I didn't yeah
(2:27:21) I fast I wouldn't care yeah me too I haven't eaten all day but how would you
(2:27:26) feel if you didn't have breakfast this morning I didn't have breakfast this morning I
(2:27:32) feel fine okay got it all right carry on go ahead
(2:27:39) [Music] I think I understand where science monk is going with this so I think it's
(2:27:45) mostly directed to me so anyway so um I was operating under the assumption that infant mortality was much higher than it
(2:27:51) is uh I was incorrect about that you know I thought it was maybe in like third world countries it was like 10 20
(2:27:57) seems like it's like one percent or something like that uh so but operating
(2:28:02) under the assumption that infant mortality is a thing uh if people are having like people if we get rid of
(2:28:10) infant mortality people can have slightly less babies right and still get
(2:28:16) to the same end goal which is like yes well I'm pretty sure that's not even what you see you see like in countries
(2:28:22) where they have a high infant mortality rate I'm pretty sure those countries people actually have more children
(2:28:28) because they have to have more children because if they don't stop at it that's correct yeah
(2:28:33) well that's one thing if you don't have it then you don't have to have as many children to offset it so okay but like
(2:28:40) we still have a declining birth rate and we still have a lot of problems
(2:28:45) associated with that our population is actually aging it's it's getting older generation after
(2:28:51) generation so this can be more and more geriatrics who need to be taken care of and fewer and fewer people to take care
(2:28:58) of them not to mention the fact that it's just kind of gonna suck for a bunch of old people to you know get old and
(2:29:07) not have families around them that's that's kind of something that I don't think is very desirable well
(2:29:13) that's that's their choice it was their choice to have kids or not have kids assuming they don't have any kind of uh
(2:29:21) um you know uh uh like procreation issues like that's that was their choice
(2:29:27) so I don't feel bad for them but yeah there's a whole bunch of issues with Social Security and stuff like that uh I
(2:29:33) do agree I think uh in the US it's gonna be a little dicey but the idea of the
(2:29:40) hope is that technology can offset a lot of those issues uh but we'll see I don't know I don't really trust technology to
(2:29:47) offset the issues if you if you think about like automating jobs and just taking care of I think there's a a whole
(2:29:53) host of problems with that um well it's not it's it's not even like something that we get a choice unless
(2:30:00) the government like uh bands it which they won't it's something that's happening like every year okay but like
(2:30:07) this there's a first of all I don't think we should hold out for that for
(2:30:12) for that to happen because for all we know like
(2:30:17) we we could run into a problem where we we can automate jobs but
(2:30:22) we end up creating jobs that we can't automate we're you know maybe we don't automate things as quickly as we as we
(2:30:29) um how can we force people to have children like if you want to say like give tax
(2:30:35) incentives for people who have certain amount of kids I'm all for that like I don't have any issue with that uh but
(2:30:41) like aside from well I think it would help if people believed it was a if more people believed it was a good thing to
(2:30:47) have children well do you do that by influencing the culture that you live in like you don't
(2:30:54) you don't go around acting like oh I guess if you just want to be a free
(2:31:00) spirit who just does whatever they want to do that's that's fun and acceptable it should be kind of taboo to not be
(2:31:06) someone who's trying to pursue these like having children I think that should be something that's kind of looked down
(2:31:12) so I think that if you don't want to have a kid okay but like you're kind of screwing the future of your own society
(2:31:19) and culture if you're not at least trying to have children you are or literally do it you're literally killing
(2:31:26) your culture you're murdering it like everything that's been done all the generations of people who have contributed to where you are today
(2:31:32) you're pissing on that for your own personal enjoyment how many I don't think that's
(2:31:40) how many children do you have I don't have children now but I'm not really
(2:31:45) um but he's so based I had enough to offset that so
(2:31:52) yeah uh my my issue right now is that I'm I'm still in college and I don't
(2:31:57) have a job yet so I'm not interested in making children until I have a job but once I graduate then I'm going to be on
(2:32:04) that task maybe um but yeah right now definitely 100 a thousand percent well you do
(2:32:11) nothing so yeah okay listen I don't have time for that right
(2:32:18) now I just need one more year I'll graduate I'll have my degree I'll get in my electrical engineering job getting
(2:32:24) paid a hundred thousand dollars a year and you can focus on do you think you'll have more or less time when you're
(2:32:31) working compared to being a college uh I've worked this in this area before and
(2:32:36) I know for a fact that I'll have more time for a multitude of reasons for one I'm working and going to school right
(2:32:41) now which is very time consuming and for another thing when you're in school
(2:32:47) especially when you're in an engineering degree you don't really know what your hours are like it's not
(2:32:54) things can get kind of like crazy like you might have a week where there's not a lot of work to do
(2:33:00) and then a week where there's so much work to do that you literally can't get it done but yeah you just when I was
(2:33:05) working as a when I was working as an engineer when I was doing my internship or when I was an electrician in the Air
(2:33:11) Force there was like there were hours that I worked like and I knew I knew when I was coming in and there were some
(2:33:18) situations where I go over time but the real issue is actually going to be money like I need to be able to provide for
(2:33:23) children if I want to have children like they need to have a house that they can live in like right now I'm I'm not I'm
(2:33:30) kind of just scraping by because I don't because I'm doing doordash on the side while going to school like I
(2:33:36) don't have a lot of money so it's not just time it's also money actually I
(2:33:42) shouldn't have said I don't have time I should have said I don't have money um I guess we just had different College
(2:33:49) experiences for me I had way more time when I was in college than I do now what did you major in I was a marketing major
(2:33:55) I went to BU yes that's kind of the electrical engineering is a is a different experience uh yeah I'm sure
(2:34:01) I'm sure I'm sure it is but you know I went to like a top 50 U.S business school so you know I was pretty
(2:34:07) strenuous at times but yeah I would say I had way more time uh when I was in college
(2:34:12) um yeah I mean again I don't think that uh people should be like shamed for not
(2:34:17) wanting to have children I think that's People's Choice um that's like shaming people for I
(2:34:23) don't know now volunteering or something like that uh well no I think it's like shaming people for not working out would
(2:34:28) be a better example for not getting a job like you're not doing your responsibility as a as a citizen of your
(2:34:34) country well if you don't want to work out I don't think you should be shamed for that either you don't want to go to the gym that's
(2:34:41) fun this is your [ __ ] decision it's your life yeah the problem is that you're you're acting
(2:34:47) like it doesn't it does affect me okay because if I live in a society where nobody goes to the gym and nobody works
(2:34:53) out and we have like a Public Health crisis for people being too fat and too obese and too sedentary and now the
(2:35:00) government wants to tax me more because they have to take care of all these poor people who are so fat and so obese and
(2:35:05) so out of shape that they're [ __ ] dying from it now that affects me okay like what you have to realize is like we
(2:35:12) can't do you believe it approach Society from a Live and Let Live perspective because we don't every the decisions
(2:35:18) that other people make do affect you yeah when you share society when I look at the decisions I'm
(2:35:25) going to make I don't think first like how can I do what's best for society I think human beings generally think how
(2:35:31) can I do what's best for myself at least that's homeless well I think I think it's fine to have some self-interest but
(2:35:36) you should have like some interest in the society that you live in like it's
(2:35:42) the society you live in like yeah you don't have to be a Communists not with something that's
(2:35:48) written as having children uh yeah you can be a good citizen without having children anyway also I think most people
(2:35:54) actually do want to have children they just haven't they're just afraid of the responsibility
(2:35:59) they're more they're more than welcome to do whatever the [ __ ] they want that's their decision I'm not gonna [ __ ]
(2:36:04) tell people you gotta have kids and shame them for not doing if they don't feel like they're up for the challenge
(2:36:09) of raising a kid which is a massive challenge I'm sure Andrew can agree to that it's not [ __ ] easy to be a
(2:36:15) father or a mother uh you know I'm not gonna say like you've got easier later when the kids all have to bake you
(2:36:22) cookies and um you kind of have like an Overlord and
(2:36:28) chocolate it becomes fun it's pretty fun later it's pretty miserable at first but that's okay yeah I'm sure I'm sure
(2:36:35) there's a lot of happiness and I'm sure there's a lot of uh really great moments
(2:36:40) and experiences that you would trade for anything in the world by having children but uh yeah again it's
(2:36:46) it's like I did it the wrong way and it was still the greatest thing that ever happened to me it was literally dead ass the greatest thing that ever happened to
(2:36:52) me in my life and I did it all the [ __ ] wrong way so I think having its period is [ __ ] good there for a long
(2:36:57) time in history we didn't have marriage and it still worked out so I don't know I'm just not in favor of assuming people
(2:37:03) for not having kids but anyway that's my final point on this let's uh do you have anything else um
(2:37:08) yeah this we're probably not gonna get around answering this question but Andrew why are you an Orthodox Christian
(2:37:18) um so I I came to Orthodoxy actually logically uh rather than first spiritually yeah
(2:37:25) that's interesting I'm trying I've I was raised a Baptist but I've been an Atheist for nine years and I'm trying to
(2:37:32) like maybe move in the direction of Christianity again and I'm I'm kind of
(2:37:37) curious like why why are you gonna hop what is like hop in the Discord I'll have a conversation with you about it
(2:37:42) but Alex doesn't want to pollute his degenerate infested Channel with too much religious talk which I think is
(2:37:48) fair it's his channel so if you want to hop in uh the Discord and have that conversation
(2:37:54) science monk Andrew like probably has like all the facts if you look at just logically he like you will see why
(2:38:00) Christianity is correct honestly yeah I'm just not a big fan the two thousand year old fairy tales I'm sorry
(2:38:07) okay Joe Rogan well don't worry if we follow your program for birth rates won't be human beings around to believe
(2:38:13) in fairy tales Alex well at least all of all of us will make it so it doesn't matter uh okay anyway
(2:38:20) anything else on spunk uh no what's the Discord that you're you're in is it just is it that Crucible
(2:38:27) thing or uh yeah it's called The Foundry oh The Foundry okay okay all right
(2:38:34) sounds good yep that's it have a good day man thank you for the time all right see you take it easy buddy
(2:38:40) all right we got one more person uh let's bring him on uh
(2:38:45) yeah but for the record I am in favor of like incentives for people to have children like tax uh you know tax uh
(2:38:53) discounts and stuff like that uh so I'm not opposed to that uh okay hello what's
(2:38:58) up dude yo what's up man what's going on you look pretty
(2:39:04) different you shave your beard or something I did I did you know because I have this wrestling match and it doesn't
(2:39:10) work with my Nacho Libre mask the beard hangs out on the bottom so I just shaved
(2:39:16) it but you know my I know you don't want to get into religious topics so but I do have to I do have to press a
(2:39:24) question here especially for Sergio you say that you hold the Bible principle you believe you
(2:39:31) say you're a Christian no I don't I don't know
(2:39:36) I didn't say you said you weren't the greatest coach I said you said you were a Christian I think that Christianity is
(2:39:41) the truth that doesn't say that I am a Christian no no no no no no no no no no no no I could pull up private
(2:39:46) conversations where you said you're a Christian so let's just not let's not I literally say on my shoulder time I'm a
(2:39:53) secular Christian that's the most opposite thing you can [ __ ] say is that yourself
(2:40:01) let me get to my question hero you're a what yeah I know Andrew it's confusing
(2:40:07) it's confusing blend science with religion and people don't know how to do that anymore but
(2:40:12) yeah you could do that for thousands of years you say you say you say marriage hasn't
(2:40:19) are you a tall short person marriage hasn't been a thing
(2:40:25) but we have biblical documentations that marriage has been a thing since the
(2:40:30) beginning so you're saying that it's not a thing or has only been a thing for a couple hundred years
(2:40:36) I said six thousand years six thousand years has been a thing okay what was it before that
(2:40:43) well probably for a little bit probably back to about eight to ten thousand years we were doing something like marriage but before that from like a
(2:40:49) hundred thousand since Homo sapiens about a hundred thousand years back to 10 000 years ago it was uh yeah it was
(2:40:54) the 80 40 thing that was going on where there was one guy possibly sleeping with a lot of women or interchangeable
(2:41:00) monogamy we did not have marriage for support that because again that's what do you remember that there was marriage
(2:41:06) for those ninety thousand years what do you have to support that they're because
(2:41:12) favorite evolutionary psychology books it talks about how we were for most of the time periods those are all
(2:41:19) theoretical and they don't have they don't have proof to support them
(2:41:25) do you think do you think let me clarify this Glenn do you think
(2:41:31) there was marriage like 50 000 years ago is that your position I don't think I don't think the Earth is 50 000 years
(2:41:36) old he's a fundamentalist he's like this is the problem with Christians today don't even believe science it doesn't
(2:41:41) make sense uh I do believe in science I think science in the Bible actually speak the same language Sergio hang on I
(2:41:48) just have one quick one real quick guys I haven't jumped in at all I just have one quick question for Sergio Sergio you
(2:41:55) are a believer in science yes can you tell us the scientific method
(2:42:00) uh no not perfectly can you tell me the scientific method perfectly the seven the seven steps yes I can tell you this
(2:42:07) you're not reading anything right you're not going to read anything off right now because I see your eyes you know
(2:42:13) I'm not like y'all I don't have a computer in front of me well it's not that lame like why all
(2:42:20) these [ __ ] people run around saying science is or God they don't even know the basic methodology
(2:42:28) without a computer screen in front of you you I can't believe that
(2:42:34) which one of you guys knows the definition to that term or not wait go ahead what you said earlier I'm trying
(2:42:40) not like to kind of let you guys go at it but what you said earlier is that it's like that you believe in science
(2:42:46) too but no like when you you said that uh I don't believe the Earth is that old well science does believe that the Earth
(2:42:52) is much older France has a theory there's no there's no there's no empirical data to prove this don't
(2:43:01) believe in carbon dating yeah there's there's a lot of empirical damage what
(2:43:06) is this what what replications of it say oh this exactly proves this is exactly
(2:43:12) this old nothing has replicated is on Wikipedia and you can learn real
(2:43:19) quick buddy but yeah to the argument about marriage because
(2:43:24) that's what you guys were talking about is that you say we live in a post-merich society
(2:43:29) I say okay you might be right there the counter to it then if you're saying the
(2:43:35) Bible is the right way to do things then do things the way that the Bible
(2:43:41) says to do them would be kind of logically and smart but you push no marriage so then what you're pushing is
(2:43:48) pre premarital sex you're pre you're preach or pushing infidelity you're pushing sexual immorality on guys and
(2:43:56) you're saying you want them to do better all those things
(2:44:02) cause problems to begin with so while we say the solution is go back to
(2:44:09) a covenantal marriage get the state out of relationships and then have that be the marriage back
(2:44:16) to what it was originally getting leverage to the woman period-centric Society where women are
(2:44:23) already fully taken over there's no reason do you even know what a covenantal
(2:44:29) marriage is it's just through you in the church and that's fine if you want something that has nothing to do with the state you're not giving the woman
(2:44:35) any leverage leverage no if you if you tell a woman I'm gonna be with you for the rest of my life with my actual
(2:44:40) sexual strategy as a male is to have a quality grab quantity not qual not quality like a woman when you have a
(2:44:47) whole different sexual strategy you're signing yourself up for failure now if she's the type of woman she's like look I understand if you might go get your
(2:44:54) dick sucked one time or something like that as long as you don't have you know an affair with another woman and you're emotionally attached to another woman if
(2:45:00) if women made that decision before the marriage and they all said we are all going to be okay with men living in
(2:45:06) their you know hedonistic nature every once in a while because they're animals and they can make a mistake and we're still gonna stay with them I would say
(2:45:12) great but the problem is the guys giving up his higher sexual strategy for that woman when he does that and I don't
(2:45:17) think that's okay I think it's a high chance of breaking up or divorcing and you don't believe in the Bible you don't
(2:45:23) think the Bible's the best practice pure good people but no people are good
(2:45:30) and pure today everybody's going through trauma can you agree with me that most people are going through trauma or most people are good people today
(2:45:36) which one are most people good are most people going through trauma and I'm bad trauma is not always a negative
(2:45:42) experience but I'm asking what's really simply like is there more people that are [ __ ] up or more people that are really good
(2:45:48) people right now that's debatable and the person the person determines how they're going to
(2:45:53) be I will I would just say that there's more people that are messed up if I'm going to give you my opinion I think 70
(2:45:58) to 80 of people are super [ __ ] up today so we have to have a whole different strategy because people aren't moral people don't have good virtues
(2:46:05) people aren't good people they sleep a lot of women are sleeping around there's no reason for you to sit here and try to
(2:46:11) do something historically that that works and we're not living in a lot of cities
(2:46:16) what I'm proving is that you would like to toot the church horn when it's convenient but then you want to toot the
(2:46:23) secular horn when it's convenient am I giving prescriptions to just men or just women I mean Glenn which one am I giving
(2:46:29) prescriptions to just men or just women both right prescription is again red pill tells you
(2:46:36) how people are and the Bible tells you what to do about how people are so yeah
(2:46:41) I agree with you on that I tell women to do exactly what the Bible says in the proper way see the marriage is
(2:46:48) not supposed to be involved in the state Andrew could quote me on this nowhere in the Bible does it say thou shalt get
(2:46:53) married with the state okay marriage was a covenant between a man and woman and
(2:46:58) God that's it now women don't deserve to get married today bro bro bro I just told Andrew
(2:47:05) this I think if a guy finds a unicorn I give him the prescription that he should [ __ ] wife her I do I want to get
(2:47:11) married Bro I literally do want to get married I think that if you fight a unicorn you should most these dorks are
(2:47:18) not going to find unicorns most these guys are gonna find a girl at all if any if a girl period so the thing is you
(2:47:25) have to give prescriptions based off of that now do I tell women all day long the best prescription for the women is
(2:47:30) always going to be The Godly one it's always going to be the religious one always keep your legs closed that's the
(2:47:35) best prescription for men too the best thing for men is The Godly one yes it is because these women are running laps on
(2:47:42) the men so you're telling hey guys I want you to sin and have a problem with God in the end so that maybe you know
(2:47:49) what you [ __ ] up and then you go to hell because that's my prescription for you guys I don't believe in heaven and hell
(2:47:54) heaven and hell is here on Earth Glenn a lot that is just to keep people locked into the religion yes dude having in
(2:48:00) hell is here on Earth go read the scripture some more bro you might learn a good degree in it you don't we're
(2:48:06) being a fundamentalist though everything literal in the Bible you
(2:48:11) literally believes it all literally it's not literally no no I believe [ __ ] because I know do you even know what a
(2:48:17) hermeneutic is do you even know okay this is getting way off Sergio answer that question do you know
(2:48:24) what do you even know what the word hermeneutics means it's the study and debate what does the word mean what does
(2:48:30) the word mean I just know it's the study of these things and debate study of what things study of what I don't know if it's all
(2:48:37) religion or just Christianity it's something like that actually it's the study of literature learning how to interpret what you read meaning if you
(2:48:44) read Shakespeare you have to practice hermeneutics and understand what shape
(2:48:54) uh the definition game I feel like is super lame let's let's move off that I do we're going on for almost three hours
(2:49:01) I do want to wrap up uh you guys are more than welcome to connect I'll be happy to connect you
(2:49:07) um I think you might have my number Glenn do you uh no I don't I don't have your number I got you uh oh wait a
(2:49:13) minute I got your email yeah okay well yeah I'll be happy to connect you guys uh do you have any like
(2:49:19) uh any last final questions for Andrew or Sergio well like my question was gonna go back
(2:49:25) to Andrew biblical patriarchy would be the best prescription
(2:49:33) to anybody that claims to be Christian correct even if it was non-biblical patriarchy
(2:49:40) so I think that I think that patriarchy in a patriarchal structure is a fundamental which can't be escaped so
(2:49:47) regardless of circumstance and even regardless of Christianity I think that the default will always be patriarchal
(2:49:53) by necessity yeah so even if you have a culture which is not Christian in other words for
(2:50:00) whatever reason right it'll still default to a patriarchal system there's no way around it Glenn are you married
(2:50:07) right now yeah I've been married okay what what is your body count my body count well
(2:50:15) it's up there it's well over 50. it's well over it's well over uh Myron Gaines
(2:50:21) were quota but wait but why are you saying that like men should live by biblical blah
(2:50:28) blah blah but you're in your own actions I made the mistake of doing that no way
(2:50:35) like I did and then I tried to say to do it but I didn't think it was benefiting me I didn't know I'm never the one that
(2:50:41) said oh I brought gems back because I didn't bring gems back that's what any anybody who understands religion
(2:50:48) understands that analogy like I don't get how you don't understand that like how like a guy through drama and learn
(2:50:54) to think I'm like literally saying like it's like the girl that says you know what yeah I sucked a lot of dick but I did it was all practice for you honey
(2:51:00) yes because men and women are the same right man you you said this on Twitter the other day you said because men and
(2:51:05) women are the same right you're so goofy when you bring up that noise but you know what telling one group of
(2:51:10) people it's okay to sin is not okay it's like oh you guys are cool to sin go ahead to your sin but girls
(2:51:16) did I'm saying that they're not God probably by the Unicorn you are though if you're saying first guys not to
(2:51:24) practice the Bible like that's not the best way for them to do it then you are encouraging them sin I'm sorry sorry is this really what it is if you're telling
(2:51:30) guys to get involved with women not be married to practice sexual immorality all right you're telling them that it's
(2:51:37) okay to say but go ahead that's what you did yourself I also tell guys don't do that when I
(2:51:44) did what I do so it's not being hypocritical it's
(2:51:50) simply saying yo I stand on the stick bro I stand on who I I stand on my [ __ ] bro I'm gonna stand
(2:51:57) on my [ __ ] I'm not gonna sit there and tell people that I'm gonna say how it is how the world is
(2:52:03) not what should you know as you know from Redfield you know what it is I'm not saying what should so you're
(2:52:08) actually saying the same thing what should you're saying what guys should do is go sleep around and mess around with
(2:52:13) all these women that's what you're saying I think the world is already messed up so you should probably find solutions to the messed up world that's
(2:52:19) all it is the solution is to go back to what works go back to what you said for men and women every man and woman
(2:52:27) you need to become Born Again virgins again guys Born Again virgins women they're no they
(2:52:32) don't believe me Born Again virgins can a man be a born-again virgin there's
(2:52:38) no such thing as Born Again virgins it was a little different when I [ __ ] those 50 girls because
(2:52:44) um I was doing it for research I wanted to see it
(2:52:51) I was not a Christian back then I didn't have this biblical worldview back then when I operated that way now that I did
(2:52:58) I see my mistakes I don't encourage people to make my same mistakes
