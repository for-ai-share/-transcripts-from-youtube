(0:00) hey everybody tonight we're debating whether or not trans women are women and we are starting right now with first
(0:05) amender opening statement thanks for being with us first amender the floor is all yours for your opening Thanks James
(0:11) uh I'm really happy to actually be here to be invited back on the modern day debate stage and I also just want to
(0:17) personally thank Andrew for deciding to take the time uh to be able to debate a small YouTuber like me so it's rather an
(0:24) honor to that that he would consider uh my debate uh now I operate on some
(0:31) preliminary required understanding which is that sex and gender are effectively two different things biological sex is
(0:38) defined by your gametes or more technically which gamt be it sperm or eggs that your body or phenotype has
(0:44) evolved to produce in humans the developmental process in which result in
(0:49) you developing a male or female phenotype are determined by which set of sex chromosomes that you have be it XX
(0:56) for females or XY for males they're do exist intersex people though this is an
(1:02) extremely rare situation which represent several chromosomal characteristics some
(1:07) may have one chromosome or they may have extra chromosomes some may have XY chromosomes and due to Androgen
(1:13) insensitivity syndrome grow with female genitalia and female body starting at an
(1:19) embryonic stage in general XX represents female and XY represents male gender is
(1:26) represented as the hormone characteristics that exist through your brain for 99.9 to
(1:32) 99.99% of people the specific hormone balance that you receive is the same as
(1:38) your sex but this isn't the same as people with differences in hormone balances such as trans people and
(1:43) interex people there are however a rare set of people where the hormone balances
(1:48) they receive at embryonic development are different from their sex characteristics this causes someone to
(1:54) feel that they are a different sex than what they physically are sexual development involves two very distinct
(1:59) developmental processes sex determination and sex differentiation sex determination is the developmental
(2:06) assignment that directs the undifferentiated zygote to progress into a sexually dimorphic individual towards
(2:13) male or female in humans chromosomal sex is determined in the fertilization which sperm contributes either an x or y
(2:19) chromosome to the X chromosome and the oite gender identity and sexual orientation are fundamentally
(2:26) independent characteristics of an individual's sexual identity and I see the rest of my
(2:32) time you got it thank you very much for that opening folks we're going to kick it over to Andrew for his opening as well want to let you know if it's your
(2:38) first time here at modern day debate I am your host Dr James Coons want to say welcome no matter what Walk of Life
(2:43) you're from we're glad that you were here hit that subscribe Button as we have many more debates coming up with that we'll kick it over to Andrew thanks
(2:49) for being with us Andrew floor is all yours so this is maybe the first time I have to go near the end of my opening
(2:56) statement and read that first and then go back to the beginning which is actually bizarre but I actually never
(3:03) heard a single argument for how trans women are women not even one I didn't I didn't hear a single argument for that
(3:09) just pointing that out uh I'll wait for my opponent to uh to come back it's a it's very rude for him to walk away in
(3:16) the opening statement because then how can he hear my arguments I can hear you they're Wireless okay well I just wanted
(3:23) to make sure but anyway uh ultimately this debate is straightforward it falls on my opponent to demonstrate why a
(3:28) woman and a trans are exactly the same thing that's the debate I contend they're not and my reasons are as
(3:34) follows they have a different sex or they wouldn't be categorized as trans simple in regards to gender this is a
(3:40) social phenomenon and not a biological one so we won't cross the two together this just become self ID and can't be
(3:46) biologically assigned because it's ultimately an empty label it doesn't any useful information about what what the
(3:52) category is with that you would think I would just win the debate outright but since I guess we have to have this debate I'll go ahead uh this debate is
(3:59) off and hilarious as with just a single moment of reflection you can see I already won it before I said a word The
(4:06) Prompt itself says everything that needs to be said as a transwoman a woman why this needs to be asked if the answer is
(4:12) yes I have no idea uh clearly we are drawing two distraint categories here
(4:17) and only one is taxonomically correct let me demonstrate how simple this is if a male wants to apply his perception of
(4:24) female traits to his own body we can call that transgender however he is still a male his application of of said
(4:30) Behavior becomes a social category rather than a biological category he is a male who engages in ex behavior my
(4:36) opponent uses a rather silly argument that because endocrinologists who are hormone specialists agree that changing
(4:42) hormones in your body can affect your mind that somehow proves something solid about this Behavior it doesn't uh in the
(4:49) work of endocrine disorders and psychiatric manifest or uh yeah manifestations living reference work
(4:54) entry uh we'll start with the relationship between endocrine and psychiatric disease Es are bidirectional
(5:01) most endocrine disorders are associated with psychological disturbances and conversely psychiatric entities uh
(5:08) induce changes in hormone activities it's a chicken or the egg dilemma did the disorder come from the psychiatric
(5:14) disease or did the psychiatric disease come from the hormone changes who knows what are common endocrine disorders
(5:20) according to the paper uh main psychiatric manifestations associated with endocrine diseases are depression
(5:26) anxiety Mania eating disorder psychosis suicidal thought thoughts uh gee we've really narrowed things down haven't we
(5:34) should we make a new taxonomical category for all of these based on sex uh of people who have these disorders
(5:40) how about female orexia does that sound correct or woman depression anonia does
(5:46) that sound right to you it's silly the biggest problem with this behavior is
(5:51) the amount of people experiencing it versus the amount of medical data available explaining it doesn't really syn up from the cast review after Dr
(5:58) Hillary Cass submitted her findings after being commissioned by the British government to do so she said quote
(6:04) there's no simple explanation for the increase in the numbers of predominantly young people and young adults who have trans or gender diverse identity but
(6:11) there is Broad agreement that it is a result of a complex interplay between biological psychological and social
(6:17) factors this balance of factors will be different in each individual further explaining the use of masculinizing
(6:23) feminizing hormones in those under the age of 18 presents many unknowns despite their long-standing use in adult
(6:28) transgender population the lack of long-term follow-up data on those commencing treatments at an earlier age
(6:34) means we have inadequate information about the range outcomes for this group clinicians are unable to determine with any c certainty which children and young
(6:40) people go on to have enduring trans identity and of course from the same report while considerable amounts of research have been published in this
(6:46) field systematic evidence reviews demonstrated the poor quality of published studies meaning there's not a
(6:52) reliable evidence base from which to make clinical decisions or for children
(6:58) and their families to make in formed choices while this is in regards to trans children the same sentiment can be
(7:04) applied across the board with most of these soft Sciences which are more akin to trial and error on an individual
(7:09) level than they are about group treatments the science is very much not settled this also puts puts into doubt
(7:15) the gender affirmation model my opponent uses to reduce harm very typical model by the way so what does any of that have
(7:21) to do uh with a trans woman being a woman literally nothing but just like
(7:26) interex my opponent will try to pretend that complex Medical sociological issues can be reduced to some kind of a claim
(7:32) so I just wanted to jump in front of it uh ultimately like I said the debate is straightforward it follows my opponent
(7:38) to demonstrate why a woman is a trans woman are exactly the same thing that's the debate I contend they're not my
(7:43) reasons are as follows they have a different sex or they wouldn't be categorized as trans simple in regards
(7:48) to gender this is a social phenomenon not a biological one we won't pross the two together this just become self ID
(7:54) can't be biologically assigned because it's ultimately an empty label doesn't point to any useful information about the category is that should be the end
(8:01) of the debate if we use logic but somehow it's impossible to do so with these little leftwing fro Loops so uh
(8:07) you know I don't know I guess we'll just keep going even though I have no idea why the general public already knows what this actually is it's a bunch of
(8:13) gay dudes that like to dress it up like girls because it gets them off and they usually suffer from autog gynophilus if of course you don't treat
(8:20) them like women they can't get off so they endlessly demand you treat them like women or they will self-d delete It's called emotional hostage taking do
(8:27) what I want or else and I take the or else path I will not affirm your lie as
(8:33) it will do damage to me to do so and if that ends in your choice to self-d delete I don't give a [ __ ] and neither
(8:39) does the entire working class of the United States and with that I'll yield the rest of my time looking forward to
(8:44) getting into this debate thank you very much and we're g to jump into the open dialogue want to
(8:50) say folks I'm going to put a poll in the chat letting you vote on where you stand
(8:55) on this topic and then a poll later on during the debate on who you thought was more persuasive without that pinging you
(9:01) very much gentlemen the floor is all yours for open dialogue yeah so just very quickly um why are trans women and
(9:09) women exactly the same thing yeah uh I'd hate to answer my question with a
(9:16) question don't do that don't do that then just answer the question hold on hold on no no no don't ask me a question
(9:22) answer the question well so leading uh you have to understand I suppose my
(9:28) logic right and no I don't need to understand your logic I need you to answer the question just take care of
(9:33) some questions so let's start off I'm not gonna answer your questions before you answer my question question at least
(9:40) owed uh you're not ow me answering my train of logic I should be able to what
(9:46) does my position have to do just just to can you remind me what the question was
(9:51) Andrew and then very simple very simp I need to know what makes a transom
(9:57) exactly the same as a woman that's what I need to know so they're
(10:02) not exactly the same as a woman okay well then that's the end woman is a woman okay not it's unfortunately not
(10:09) the end of the debate I have to ask you no that's the end of the debate as a leading question how do you determine
(10:16) somebody to be a woman do you okay so just so you understand I don't know if you can read or not but the debate
(10:21) prompt says are trans women women I asked you if they're exactly the same thing you said no that's the end of the
(10:27) debate I'll take your concession now well well no not necessarily because we have to discuss uh what it is how you
(10:34) determine somebody to be a woman I think it's very important to understand that to then understand the answer to my
(10:40) question I can of course answer your question we need to go over some basics for starters how do you determine
(10:46) somebody to be a woman what what what does that have to do with anything I asked specifically I just want to make
(10:53) sure I got this correct regarding I want to make sure I got this correct my claim I'm asking how you determin somebody to
(11:00) let's try this again I asked the question is a transwoman the exact same
(11:06) thing as a woman your answer is no that's the end of the debate sir I've already explained it to you so I guess
(11:13) if you're not willing to answer the question are they the same exact thing or not sir fine we're going to go ahead and start over then so typically how you
(11:21) determine somebody to be a woman is that you generally look at them you don't pull their pants down you do not take
(11:27) their blood and then determine that they are a Woman based on having XX
(11:32) chromosomes you look at them that means that you observe typical phenotypes that
(11:38) are typical of that a female to determine whether or not that they are a woman so one good example of this is uh
(11:46) You observe that they have breasts hips a facial structure that is vindicative
(11:51) in a specific way that would indicate that they are in fact a woman you
(11:56) yourself would look at somebody uh and based off of those phenotypes determine
(12:02) that they are a woman yeah but are they a real woman under that basis well but that's not the question the question is
(12:08) are trans women women yeah are able to look at hang I just listen to all this
(12:13) my turn my turn I just listen everything you're not understanding you can't fill a buster the debate bro can't FST the
(12:20) debate my turn my I literally just patiently listen to your entire stupid diet tribe so here's
(12:27) the thing very simple question for you can you draw a woman on a piece of paper
(12:33) I sure can is it real is that a real woman I mean it's a picture of a woman it's is a real woman no it's not a real
(12:40) woman okay picture a woman so when you say is a transwoman a woman do you mean
(12:45) that that a trans woman is a woman in the same way that a picture drawn of a woman is a woman or do you mean that a
(12:51) trans woman is a woman in the same way objectively a female is a female a woman is a woman well or are they
(12:59) expain to you that you determine somebody to be a Woman based on their phenotypes and so if they Poss
(13:05) phenotypical expression phenotypical Expressions not sure so if they are taking hormone replacement therapy and
(13:10) they possess the same fat distribution and they effective it's called the passing transperson according to you by
(13:17) your very own metrics they are a woman because that's how you determine woman I have literally given
(13:24) you a single one of my question well how can you then say then by my metrics anything one more time bro how can you
(13:30) say by to be a woman okay so so you answer question okay I'll answer the
(13:35) question but stop for a second because we still got to get some clarification here you're on the yes position you're
(13:42) making the affirmative claim here the affirmative claim is that yes they are
(13:47) women I need to know what type of woman we're talking about are we talking about
(13:52) are the same type of woman as like my wife for instance no not necessarily is your wife a trans woman that
(14:00) no no why I don't understand uh do do you think that that's a dunk so so
(14:05) they're different my wife would be a different type of woman than a trans woman well I mean I'm saying that you're
(14:11) saying whether or not that they would be women right the fact that you're saying there that you're even bothering to call them a transom is tedly calling them
(14:18) women okay uh no well I don't understand um that's trans so that's a that's a
(14:24) very strange allocation do you do you understand that there is a term called [ __ ] what does the term [ __ ] refer to
(14:31) female dogs a female dog right so we can make an allocation uh to something which
(14:37) is a female and a classification towards a human too we call that a woman that's
(14:42) what that is that's referring to a human female like a [ __ ] is referring to a female dog so with the word [ __ ] we can
(14:48) now determine it's a dog and it's female and when we say woman we can now determine it's a human and it's female
(14:54) so that's how I would classify what a woman is very simple hang shut up man so I bro I'm trying to give you my defition
(15:01) and you won't even shut up long enough to get it I mean you wouldn't even answer a single question I'm answering it literally right
(15:09) now finish his point and then we'll come right back to you first BR I'm not only am I answering your question right but
(15:16) I'm answering it concisely if [ __ ] is a reference to a dog which is also a female then we can use the word [ __ ]
(15:23) anytime somebody uses it it refers to dog and female just like when we use the word woman we're referring to a human
(15:30) who's also female right very simple by your own logic now we know exactly what
(15:35) Andrew Wilson thinks a woman is now what do you think a woman is well I don't think women are [ __ ] uh I think what
(15:42) does that have to do with anything is an adult well you're referring to women as [ __ ] I'm I didn't refer to women as
(15:49) [ __ ] you idiot what did I refer to as a [ __ ] what did I refer to as a [ __ ] allude to you were what did I refer to
(15:55) as to humans obviously uh as a classification dude and so we can go
(16:02) right back to the topic no I'm afraid I can't let you get away with I can't let you get away with that when did I
(16:08) call question such a simple anybody can answer with okay ask the question again
(16:14) I'll give you the same answer but just to Andrew had asked when did he ever call them that I want yeah when did I
(16:19) ever call him that what you called you were you were referencing as an analogy
(16:26) of [ __ ] and regarding female dogs we're not talking about female dogs it's
(16:32) not relevant to the discussion I asked you what a [ __ ] is you said a female dog the only relevancy is we need to be
(16:39) talking about trans issues or or I'm sorry whether or not that trans women or women trans women as well as uh as well
(16:46) as say your wife you know a biological woman they're not uh uh dogs right so
(16:53) it's fair to say that making a comparison regarding dogs is not analogous so that is the dumb listen bro
(17:01) okay so I'm going to answer you can't filibuster the debate let me respond okay so this is really simple the reason
(17:08) I asked you the question of what a [ __ ] is you said a female dog is so that I could show you that we have a word which
(17:13) would refer to both a dog and a female at the same time so it's a dog and it's a female dog at the same time with the
(17:20) same word it gives us two criteria for information I then said If I use the word woman it's doing the same thing
(17:28) it's saying this is a human being who's also a female same exact thing female
(17:33) that's that is not calling women [ __ ] you [ __ ] lunatic well that would be
(17:39) an argument as if that that uh dogs are analogous or the definition is analogous
(17:46) it's a taxonomical classification that's it taxonomical classification right it's totally we're
(17:53) talking about taxonomy we're talking about taxonomy not at all not at all uh we're talking about trans women and
(17:59) whether or not that they are women that would be a taxonomical classification no there why don't you tell me what
(18:05) taxonomical means what they would I mean we we would be uh homo Homo Sapien
(18:11) sapiens I mean that's I don't see and that can be you can also be female or male that would be taxonomical you could
(18:18) be you could you could talk about all sorts of different reductions within taxonomy which are necessary that's
(18:23) literally what we're talking about question about sexual differentiation and have mercy well I
(18:30) don't know what to tell you how do you determine someone to be a woman it's very simple very simple question they have to be a female I think to be a
(18:38) female who's an adult let get this straight right when you're walking to this uh person right that you don't know
(18:44) whether or not that they are male or female the way that you determine that they are female is that they have to be a female that's circular so why don't
(18:50) you explain to me how do you determine that they are a woman okay you're asking two different questions NOP that's the
(18:57) same question how do you if you don't want me to answer then keep talking okay so you're asking you're
(19:04) asking two different questions here that you asked how do you determine it right
(19:09) and then you said how is it not circular so these are two two very distinct questions so first of all even if I make
(19:17) a determination on what I think is a female based on a phenotypical expression I could be wrong just like I
(19:24) can't tell the difference in sex between dogs often so I could say come here girl and it's actually a boy and I just don't
(19:30) know the difference but the truth of the matter is still the same so you're saying well wait you make a a hristic
(19:37) determination based on what you phenotypically see I wouldn't even dispute that just has nothing to do with
(19:43) the truth of the matter the classification of a woman is still female even if I C subjectively can be
(19:49) tricked into thinking a male is a female that has nothing to do with
(19:55) anything yeah yeah we're going to have to unfortunately be stuck on the same question because you've answered with a
(20:01) circular uh understanding so I asked you initially how do you determine someone
(20:07) to be a woman and your answer was if they are a female unfortunately if you
(20:13) are going to approach a person you don't know whether or not that they are male or female the way that you determine that they are female is if they are
(20:19) female that is a circular response I'm going to ask you one more time how do you determine somebody's black how do
(20:25) you determine hang on how do you determine someone's black how do you determine someone's black I look at them okay and so when you look
(20:31) at them you can determine that they're black right yeah you look but is there SCI is there a scient yeah is there a scientific done
(20:38) within about half a second and is there a scientific way to make the determination that they're black sure you can so there me test yeah so then
(20:45) there's two different types of determination that we're using here which I already already told you one is
(20:50) a subjective versus asking about two one a subjective versus objective metric when you say to me Andrew how do you
(20:57) personally make this determination right I say a woman is female that is true you
(21:03) say well wait it's shut up bro let me finish you say that's circular all all
(21:10) subjective categorizations for a thing are circular all of them there's not a
(21:15) single one an interpretive subject subjective personal interpretation of a
(21:21) thing which is not circular I determine this can to be a can because it's
(21:27) cylindrical in shape what does that mean well it means it's cylindrical in shape what does that well it means it's cylindrical it's the same [ __ ] but the
(21:34) truth of the matter is an entirely different determination so if we're asking the question this debate is not
(21:41) how Andrew Wilson subjectively determines whether or not uh you're a woman or a male and can he be tricked it
(21:48) is in fact objectively is this person a woman or a man and if woman is alluding
(21:56) to sex as the priority then you have to be an adult human female to fit that
(22:01) categorization what is your reputation to this yes uh I have to I'm going to
(22:07) try to see if I can pull you out of your circular logic here you said how do you
(22:13) determine someone to be a woman you've unfortunately doubled down and you said if they are female unfortunately you uh
(22:20) approach them and the way that you determine is uh whether or not that they are female is that they are female is
(22:26) circular so unfortunately I'll try to help no no no that you would be are there a series you would be asking me
(22:32) what is a female you would have to ask what is a female from there that that's correct yeah yeah that's yeah you didn't
(22:38) ask me what is a female you asked me what is a woman to pause asking me what is a woman I say a female you say it's C
(22:45) Andrew Andrew Andre stupidest thing I ever heard fromo well no because you're applying circular logic so I'm trying
(22:50) circular logic to pull you out of your circular logic nope it's not circular logic start over here right we have to
(22:56) use what is circular first let's start with we talking about how do you deter I actually don't understand the question
(23:02) unless you explain to me what does circular logic mean what does that mean circular logic is where you're using the
(23:09) logic in the form of the question as its predicate so it's circular it's recursive in its in its position would
(23:16) you say that that is the case with hang on I want to make sure that I'm correct questions I need you to I need to know
(23:21) what we're talking you say that all start over again you have to I think if
(23:28) I can't I got where you're coming from first Amer I want to give Andrew a chance for someone respond before we go to the next
(23:34) point so wouldn't all axioms fall under the category of circularity
(23:39) then would axioms fall no they are axioms by their very definition they are not circular okay so uh so for you what
(23:48) is circular logic is just that um you use thing X and come back to thing X in
(23:55) a circle right that's what we're saying yeah yeah okay got it got it can you
(24:01) describe anything for me that doesn't do that huh well I mean an you just said it
(24:08) yourself but an is does an axom exist in objective reality uh sure yeah it can exist in an
(24:15) objective where show me where show me where it can exist so if I measure this side of the
(24:21) book uh and this side of the book I would know what its hypotenuse is yeah
(24:27) right how's that well it's axiomatic in the sense that we live in a ukian world and that this
(24:33) threedimensional space works so there you go we just that's not so is that
(24:38) subjective or objective is that subjective or objective what makes it objective well what what makes it
(24:43) objective indpendent of our perception but that this is we're getting wait wait wait wait hang on hang on wait wait wait
(24:49) it's not it's not I got to make sure we're clear on our woman bro I have to make sure that we're clear on our terms
(24:55) do you understand that like do you want to be talking past each other this whole time or not not at all I I want I want
(25:01) so then I just clarified my ter it is that you determine somebody to be a woman this you you have to stop talking
(25:06) long enough to just answer a few questions so I understand your actual position here okay well you've you've
(25:12) been over talking to me this whole time and I'm trying to ask a simple question
(25:18) I'll tell you I'll tell I want to give Andrew a chance because because it's impossible for us
(25:23) to make any determinations here unless I do so here's here's I guess what I'm
(25:28) asking I'm asking if there is an objective versus subjective context for
(25:34) reality a thing which exists in objective reality versus a thing which exists in subjective
(25:41) reality uh subjective reality is kind of weird because like reality in its basis
(25:47) is uh from an axiomatic perspective like a social construct is a social construct objective it's subjective it's
(25:54) subjective okay great would you consider gender to be a social construction well it's complicated some of it is
(26:02) predicated off of uh objective constructs and neurochemical constructs
(26:07) and in others it is not it just depends on what specifically you're referring so it's a case by case basis no it's based
(26:14) on very specific uh positions for example there's some sex typical uh
(26:20) behaviors that emerge which are socially that are social constructs however have
(26:25) a neurochemical basis behind it take for example the existence of that people
(26:32) tend to hang out with uh same seex uh especially you know Elementary Middle
(26:37) School you tend to hang out as friends with the same sex uh this is typical not
(26:43) just among humans but as well as among uh other other mammals as well uh they
(26:48) tend to hang out of the same sex and however well it that's based that would
(26:53) be a social construct that is based off of a a neurochemical b balance so the
(26:59) neurochemical balance would be what would be objective not the social construction that yes correct yes I'm
(27:04) saying that the pr predicate is what's important yeah so then gender is pointing to sex on either end of its
(27:10) Spectrum yes it has to be otherwise must know what female is and what male is or
(27:16) we can't have a gender to be that sex uh is is uh what what is beginning and then
(27:22) what emerges from that is gender yes okay great so so this idea of sex gender
(27:28) is pointing to H is objectively true well uh the the the predicate is
(27:36) yes but the gender can be subjective again it depends it is subjective sure I agree so so then the ins that is
(27:41) pointing to male and female all I want to do is get a simple definition of what those terms are and then we're not
(27:49) speaking past each other anymore so what is a female like like what is a woman is that
(27:54) what you're no a female what is a female it's typically XX
(28:00) chromosomes that result in uh phenotypes that are typical that uh come
(28:07) from XX chromosomes uh such as a vagina they don't have to have XX they don't have to have XX chromosomes oh that's
(28:14) correct I mean they could have X they could have Androgen and that doesn't fit the criteria of
(28:19) females so back well like it's it's the point is it's that's fair I mean it's
(28:25) complicated it's a complicated position can't tell me what a female is well
(28:30) actually I I've asked you specifically don't ask me answer me what you can't
(28:35) tell me what a female is well I I did I just did no you didn't you you said somebody with XX I said but you could
(28:42) have x y and be a female you said yeah so how's that tell me what that's correct because there is a there's a difference there right there's
(28:48) additional features it's complicated you're talking so then so then what is an endocrinological response it's not a
(28:54) simp that doesn't tell me anything bro what is a female I've already explained it atomes that typically result can you
(29:01) have can you be an XY female can you be an XY female but to be fair I Andre asked I think Andrew said aren't there
(29:07) cases where there's also an XY and you said yes there are so then our def so I'm not getting anywhere in
(29:13) this definition it's not telling me what a female is if you can be XY and not xx
(29:18) and you say XX is the requirement for female then I understand how that's a
(29:24) female well again it's because you're talking about the phenotypic characteristics and this is kind of why
(29:31) I wanted to figure out your position based off some quick let's do phenotypic
(29:37) okay sure we do phenotypic whaty right like you said that how do you determine
(29:43) somebody to be a a woman and your answer was if they are female I actually haven't gotten an answer on female yet I
(29:50) need to know what a female ised it and have explained it three times we have to I would like to go back because you've
(29:56) been stuck on the same em have XY or XX chromosomes hold on pause pause I don't
(30:02) know what we're talking about so I can't I can't even engage with you bro I just want to have a discussion with you I
(30:07) can't have a discussion with you if we can't Define our terms well no we we can and I did Define it I defined it through
(30:12) you said if somebody has X chromosomes but also could have XY that so so I mean that doesn't tell me what fale for
(30:19) example Androgen insensitivity syndrome they grow with female genitalia and female body starting at an embryonic
(30:25) stage and uh the doctor looks at their genitals and if they don't have any genital aberration and they just happen
(30:32) to have a labia vagina we look at them they go female right even though that they are XY what makes fale then a
(30:39) person's well it's it's a series of phenotypes that we determine whether or not that they're female that's how what
(30:45) what phenotypes uh they could for example have a a vagina or they could not uterus
(30:52) or they could not Fallopian tubes or they that's correct you use a collection it's a they could have none of those
(30:58) things and XY chromosomes and still be female well now we're talking not NE no
(31:03) that's now you're talking about uh regarding woman which is different from female no female female yeah we're
(31:10) talking about different things though so going back I wanted to I wanted to say you said that if they are female right
(31:17) that is how you determine somebody to be a woman so what are the what are the things that you look at uh uh what is it
(31:24) that you do to determine that they are female and not male that they're there in regards to the sex that's typically
(31:30) associated with reproduction that would be female okay so you look at the sex that is typical to
(31:37) uhu so okay okay so so let me get this straight you go up in you're in an alley
(31:43) right and you uh get to you get to meet a person you don't know uh whether or not that they are male or female and the
(31:49) way that you determine that they are male or female is that you pull their pants down and you uh take a m you take
(31:55) a a magnifying glass and you look at no of course not there's plenty of ugly women who who I think are men there's
(32:02) plenty of ugly saying like what you do I half a second so what is it okay very
(32:10) quickly because I can be tricked the truth of the matter of whether they're
(32:15) male or female is not in dispute that is not what's in dispute you saying that a
(32:21) really really [ __ ] ugly woman uh can trick me into thinking that that's a
(32:26) male I AG I can be tricked into into thinking that people are males and females who are not
(32:33) so what they're still either male or female right uh yes uh their sex doesn't change
(32:40) well then if that's the case then a woman is still a female who is an adult
(32:45) and that's what we mean when we say woman and when we say transwoman we're talking about a male who is pretending
(32:51) to be a female who's an adult that's it Case Closed oh but sir you're still stuck unfortunately on what when I said
(32:58) how somebody to be a woman you said uh if they are female so I asked okay what
(33:04) do you do to determine that they're female they have reproductive organs nope that's not what I said what did I
(33:10) say exactly what you said what did I say okay then clarify what you said I said it's the I would associate it as the sex
(33:17) which is a typically associated with reproduction doesn't mean they have to be able to reproduce a 90-year-old woman
(33:23) can't reproduce but she's still very much a female still very much associated with the which can reproduce you don't need to
(33:29) have any sort of reproductive organs because if you don't have reproductive organs you're still associated with the sex which can reproduce yes just to be
(33:38) sure just to be sure I understand just because I want to build a track with the conversation as well by reproduce you
(33:43) mean like give birth like you're around can't have children there's only one sex which can't have children and all of the
(33:50) other Sexes which are associated with that sex are female and there's only one sex that's female that can do that are
(33:56) there are there would you say that are women that can't have children I literally just walked you through this
(34:02) of course there are okay so they're still associated with the sex that does so so I wanted to figure out exactly
(34:09) what it is because we we still haven't really figured it out right I you know I ask how do you determine someone to be a
(34:15) woman you said if they are female yeah great and then I said okay well how do
(34:20) you determine somebody to be a female us oh so well I gave you the definition of female you want a scientific way to
(34:26) define hold on hold on X mhm they said the sex which you said which the sex
(34:32) which is typically associated with reproduction so yes going back to my original uh hypothetical you meet some
(34:39) random person out in the street and uh you uh you obviously probably aren't
(34:45) pulling their pants down you're talking to me right now right you're not in prison I hope uh so you probably aren't
(34:52) really looking at their reproductive organs to determine if they are female and therefore woman
(34:58) so I'm going to ask you again what is it that you do to determine someone to be a woman you usually do it in about take
(35:05) yeah I take a look at all of the different traits of the sex which is typically associated with reproduction you look at them sure is that what you
(35:13) do you look at them yeah sure all right I like and do you agree with me that people can be
(35:19) tricked hold on do you agree with me that people can be trick WR down what you just said do you agree with me that
(35:24) people can be tricks sir yes it is possible for okay so so then the the truth of the
(35:30) matter is not whether or not I Andrew Wilson can be tricked into believing
(35:35) that a male is a female or that a female is a male the a the question here is
(35:40) what is the truth of the matter is it a male or a female or is it not and whether or not you can trick me has no
(35:47) bearing on that whatsoever if you and I agree there are males and there are females and there are not any third sex
(35:54) there are male and females and that's it and if that that is the case then everybody on planet Earth you meet is
(35:59) going to be one of those categories or the other and if they are their ability to trick you has no [ __ ] bearing on
(36:05) that whatsoever that's unfortunately beside the point how's that how's that beside
(36:11) the that is the point well it it is because uh you said uh the argument is
(36:18) uh whether or not trans women are women Andale how do you determine someone to
(36:24) be a woman the answer is you look at them and more scientifically speaking
(36:29) you're going to be observing specific phenotypes oh Lord uh and the collection of the phenotypes will determine whether
(36:37) or not that they are a woman within a half a second of you looking at them therefore if a transwoman passes by you
(36:44) your very metric Andrew would associate them in that moment as
(36:50) woman let me ask you a question do you think that it's possible for you to categorize Asians as being white by
(36:56) accident yes what is the truth of the matter though well I mean I would probably say like uh you know are you
(37:03) white they say no I'm Asian probably be it great so so there is still a truth of the matter well I mean if they told me
(37:11) actually I am white then because I called just because I called them white and the subjective way in which I
(37:18) determined that they were white was incorrect there would still be a truth of the
(37:23) matter uh well again it's it's more complex no it's not more complex would
(37:29) there still be a truth of the matter or wouldn't there be what race am I I have no idea why not why why I don't know you
(37:36) look like a white dude I'm a white dude are you sure yeah so I'm guessing like uh somewhere around Western or Eastern
(37:41) Europe I would guess huh interesting both of my parents come from Chile so I am
(37:47) Chilean who came from and the base for Chilean is surprised how did you figure
(37:52) that out though because I looked at you and that's what I saw okay so that's kind of what we when it comes to women
(37:58) nobody dis you're bro nobody disputed right you asso why are you trying to
(38:04) evade this so hard one more time one more time that's the that's the logic how do I concede all these points and
(38:10) you still go back to them as though I didn't concede to them they just have no bearing on the topic well it to the
(38:16) topic I want you to know what you just said or let you know what you just said you just I said you're a white
(38:22) guy you said you said I'm a white guy and or I'm not a white guy Chilean right
(38:29) so you corrected me with the truth of the matter so the thing is is like whatever my subjective metric is I say
(38:36) you're white you're not white you're something else other than white whatever that is you agree with me there is still
(38:41) a truth of the matter regardless of how I subjectively interpret it for instance
(38:46) do you think that you can mistakenly sex an animal so you could think that a female dog was a male dog or a male dog
(38:53) was a female dog sure does that somehow make them male or female uh no because we're not talking about
(39:00) male or female we're talking about we're talking about a social categorization of self-identification well it could be
(39:05) social categorization or it could be a genetic and basis that then result in
(39:11) typical hormon so let me for a moment Grant your argument to you and say okay that's how we determine them to be men
(39:17) or women okay fair enough I'll just grant this for the sake of argument so does that mean that anytime I meet a
(39:24) transwoman who I think is a man I can then categorize them safely as a man and
(39:30) that's fine well unfortunately not and the reason why is it really just comes
(39:36) down to a level of respect I I would imagine that weer Golden Rule uh that
(39:42) you know say for example if you yourself were trans and you cared about this very
(39:48) much you know and you found it very distressing if somebody did not call you by your preferred gender you know I
(39:54) would I would see no issue in in treating them with respect as well this is I mean this is fantastic so wait a
(40:00) second so just so I got this straight you expect me to believe that the categorizations that Andrew Wilson has
(40:07) is in in his mind of how to categorize a person comes off of a phenotypical expression not the truth of the matter
(40:14) and then if your phenotypical expression is incorrect and I categorize you as the thing that you that you are I'm still
(40:21) wrong well if they say I I'm actually uh she her you know you could just go okay
(40:29) well you know I'll refer you as she her you can't do that this doesn't answer to my question if it comes from Andrew
(40:35) Wilson's subjective categorization that you are a Woman based on the fact that that I mistake you as being one
(40:42) therefore you are one then if I don't mistake you for being one and see
(40:48) clearly that you're a man why is that not just as good of a social categorization as the opposite I don't
(40:55) understand that I I don't understand your question that seemed kind of all if all women in Andrew Wilson's mind are
(41:01) female and I can C categorize every single one of them based on a phenotypical expression and the ones who
(41:08) are actually males who I think in my mind are females are females that wouldn't that mean that the ones who are
(41:14) males that I categorize are males are actually males I I don't understand your question
(41:20) I'm so sorry if I can tell that you're a dude and call you a dude by your logic I
(41:26) should be right yeah generally speaking that is right 99.9% of the time so that if I C so that
(41:33) if I categorize you as being a man I would be correct by your same logic well but I'm not I'm not trans so you would
(41:40) be correct yeah but if I call anybody anybody anybody who said that they were
(41:46) a woman then well then the debate's over then the debate's over so all your day
(41:51) that's not the question yeah so all you're saying is this I'm going to summarize your entire position super simple pause pause here's no pause I'm
(41:57) going to summarize this you tell me if I got this right right or wrong I mean I do want to back and forth I really do
(42:03) this is great this is like this is fantastic so by your logic summize Andrew and then I do want to yeah I'll summarize and kick it back here's the
(42:09) summarization of your entire position the summarization in your position is Andrew if they can fool you then they're
(42:15) a woman if they can't fool you then they're not that's a cation of your
(42:20) entire position no it's not because I'm willing to respect individuals and their
(42:26) gender IDE identity it doesn't bother me or harm me in any way to uh respect
(42:32) their gender identity so if it's entirely does not possess the phenotypic uh uh consensus really it's just a
(42:39) matter or not if whether or not that you walk out your door and you uh kind of want to be a jerk all day or if you want
(42:46) to just you know uh have some social decorum amongst yourself I mean I imagine if you step outside your door
(42:53) and you wear clothing you probably already adhere to a level of social decorum this is just one extra step uh
(43:00) but by the the original debate was whether or not that you determine
(43:06) somebody to be uh a woman the specific the specific debate that's not the
(43:11) debate prom tell me the debate prompt I apologize that's I was my initial question not the debate prompt yeah
(43:17) what's the debate prompt it's it's our trans women women right are trans women women are they the
(43:24) same category or not and by your own admission mult times now we've discovered well I'll take you through
(43:29) the train of logic because you've actually given me your self defeater unfortunately I can't wait to hear you
(43:36) had said that I said how do you determine someone to be a woman and your answer was after me picking and prodding
(43:43) that you finally came to the correct answer which is you look at them and if
(43:48) they possess specific phenotypes that are typical of that a female you yourself would refer to them as a woman
(43:55) therefore if there is a transwoman that passes you by your very
(44:01) metric Andrew would say that trans women are women so let me make sure that I uh
(44:08) that I got this correct right within the summarization what you're also saying
(44:13) then is that if I mistu a person to be an elf because they had Elven ears glued onto their head and lived in a woodland
(44:20) forest as long as I mistake them for being that thing then they are that thing because there's no way for me to
(44:25) determine that thing other than my subjective experience around the thing correct well elves don't exist from oh
(44:32) they don't exist oh wait a sec they don't exist so wait I don't understand trans people are not all that is is a
(44:40) construction of the mind all that exists in objective reality exists at a neurochemical level neurochemical
(44:46) meaning what mental illness no no there is a neurochemical balances that are
(44:51) able to be observed not just in the brain chemistry itself the hormone differenti iation as well as different
(44:59) portions of the brain that are differently sized based male orale fair enough I'll Grant this I'll even Grant
(45:04) this argument too so if there was such a neurochemical disorder as to make people it's not a disorder it's just differ
(45:11) okay neurochemical that if everybody had this neurochemical ratio inside of their [ __ ] brain they glued on Elven ears
(45:18) and demanded to be called elves would you call them elves I mean if you're talking about like just like if are they
(45:25) getting like upset if if I don't call them an elf I'll just call them an elf I don't yeah you would just call them so
(45:31) basically all all that so again your position your position just reduces to this no matter what no matter which
(45:37) angle we go at it from right it reduces to the truth of the matter is these are
(45:42) just males and females who are dressing up as the opposite sex but because sometimes you can't tell and the way that you classify them is the only way
(45:50) that you know how to classify anything that you're looking at there therefore they're that thing I need you to
(45:55) understand that not only is that a stupid argument and makes no sense but we can apply this to everything on
(46:01) planet Earth literally everything on planet Earth and it it that would not give us a good taxonomical
(46:06) categorization in fact I'm willing to even Grant all of this I'm even willing
(46:11) to Grant all of this just to move into the harm element here do you agree with
(46:17) me sir that Christians feel like they are harmed if they have to lie to
(46:22) people well that is understanding under the predicate that you are lying I don't believe that you are lying because I
(46:29) believe that no no I'm not asking you the Christian the Christian doesn't believe the trans is trans does the
(46:35) Christian allow me to answer the question not be interrupted okay fine dude straw man it and then I'll ask it
(46:41) again goad not straw Manning it I'm then give me my position back if you're not steal man it I'm not going to be able to
(46:47) memorize every perfectly you can't steal man it you don't even know what my position is because you dud listen to my
(46:52) actual question your is is that you don't believe trans I want to I want you to ask
(46:58) you don't want to lie do Christians feel harmed if they feel like they are lying
(47:04) to people do they false predicate you're not lying by your very do they think
(47:09) they're lying no by your very metric you're not lying does the Christian
(47:14) think he's lying lying requires intent yes as in
(47:19) and if they don't believe that you're a man or a woman pause okay go ahead lying requires intent or malice
(47:27) however being mistaken does not actually indicate the intent of malice so if you
(47:35) were tricked based on the series of phenotypic responses by the very fact that you have just mentioned that the
(47:41) way that you determine somebody to be a woman is that you look at them therefore they effectively trans women can be
(47:49) women by your very basis you tacitly saying that they are women and calling
(47:54) them women is not you lying it's you being mistaken therefore there is no harm great so then let me ask you this
(48:02) question you just agreed with me that if I categorized a man who wanted to be
(48:08) called a woman a man cuz I could tell clearly it was not a woman but a man
(48:14) that you would do it anyway to be nice in that case you would have to admit
(48:20) that the Christian would have grounds to note that they were lying correct well the question is is not my question don't
(48:27) rephrase it answer it the problem is with your logic is that not all trans
(48:35) women right to you but rather if trans women can be women so all I need is a
(48:43) tiny subcategory why why aren't you answering my question bro trans well because you're already defeated by
(48:49) predicate logic I have pres you yes the predicate is how you determine someone
(48:55) to be a woman you said that you look at them bro is that's a secondary question
(49:01) to the I'm asking you can have a trans person that passes first matter just for the sake of argument and I I'll allow
(49:07) you to ask a question similar to Andrews that's kind of adjacent but still
(49:12) relevant in terms of taking the perspective of whoever it is whatever
(49:17) group Christians or otherwise for the sake of argument if they believe
(49:23) otherwise and they're having to say out loud their pressur to say other than
(49:28) what they believe thinking Andrew saying like is this good for people roughly speaking and I have no empirical basis
(49:36) that it causes any harm whatsoever to be polite okay so just real quick I just want to make sure I got this right you
(49:43) agree with me then by your own logic here that if I were to run into a person
(49:50) who wanted to be called a woman but I could clearly tell that they were a man I could clearly tell this that there are
(49:56) going to be many cases where that is the case correct uh on well I'm sorry can you
(50:03) repeat the question there are going to be many cases where it would be correct that somebody who wanted to be
(50:08) identified as a woman I could clearly tell they were a man correct yeah I mean you generally will
(50:15) look at somebody to determine whether or not the so if that person asked me to call them a woman that would be
(50:22) requesting that I tell them something which was untrue correct
(50:32) well unfortunately not because it could exist at a neurological level not necessarily outputting to General from a
(50:39) biological level from a biological level well that is biological the neurolog
(50:44) neurological level is in fact biological then all you have to do is demonstrate demonstrate for me right now that I
(50:53) there that anybody would ever be able to make the distin iction uh versus self ID
(50:58) so for instance what if for instance uh I you and I could agree to these terms
(51:04) very simple terms right most trans women have never had a neurological test to
(51:11) make a determination as to their transness well the question is not
(51:17) whether or not that they are all 100% trans or not yeah but just that that
(51:23) there is a percentage of them that are and so very metric if I had the there's no
(51:30) reason for me to assume it though well but it's not really rather an assumption
(51:35) I'm simply pointing out that exist the the uh differences in uh uh brain
(51:42) structure as well as at neurochemical levels that causes someone to be more female likee even though say they are
(51:48) more male uh you could for example observe their external phenotypes uh in
(51:54) the combination and assume that they are a male how ever their neurochemical basis is not there it doesn't matter
(52:00) whether or not that they have been tested because unfortunately is if they do have that you have tacitly admitted
(52:08) that trans women can be women therefore you have I want to make sure I got this
(52:13) I want to make sure I got this right right uh just just making sure on this particular section of the argument I got
(52:18) this right you agree with me that the way that I would make a determination as
(52:24) to whether you were a man or a woman is with my eyeballs right the way that you
(52:30) determine somebody to be a woman is with your eyeballs yes you look at them okay so if that's how I determine a person to
(52:35) be a woman and you're saying that if I'm tricked into believing a male is a woman I should treat them as a woman right
(52:43) because that's how I would perceive them as being then if I perceive them as being a man right then clearly in that
(52:52) case if they asked me to call them a woman I would be lying to them I would literally be lying to them
(52:58) because I could see with my own eyeballs that they were telling me something which wasn't true well there could be
(53:04) differences in the neurochemistry it would not be a lie okay well my neurochemistry tells me within logical
(53:10) boundary even by your own metric couldn't Christianity also could Christianity be based in neurochemistry
(53:16) very important couldn't Christianity be also based in neurochemistry couldn't couldn't it be a Deliverance system
(53:23) don't I mean it would have to be if it's biological we''ve all to be believe that I no I I don't believe that uh that that
(53:30) that it is I believe it is socially constructed mainly because oh so three billion three billion people are
(53:35) Christians but you don't think that there are neurochemicals inside the brain which assist with being a Christian only with being transgender
(53:42) well that that's a different question because you said whether or not that there was a basis in uh Christianity
(53:49) yeah there's no reason for me to assume that the thing that makes people got to allow me to finish go ahead go ahead
(53:55) talking about over 2 million years uh or I'm sorry I think the modern human is
(54:01) over 250,000 years old obviously Christians uh had only existed in the
(54:07) past 2,000 so it is fair to say that it is it is not biologically linked it is a
(54:13) social no you could be you could be wired towards a social construction of any kind based on a pre- predicated
(54:20) social construction like Judaism Judaism from Zoroastrianism etc etc etc that
(54:26) doesn't mean that your neurochemical structure based on biology From Evolution wouldn't follow that Trend
(54:33) correct I'm sorry you will have to repeat your question I I I could tend to be get very distracted at times so I
(54:40) apologize go ahead okay so just real I'm only going
(54:45) to repeat this one more time at this point I I think you must be trolling because this is [ __ ] ridiculous not trolling with you I have
(54:53) walked you through your own logic you determine someone to be a woman you say you look at them and but that
(55:01) doesn't mean that they're a woman that can well just because they're trick that doesn't a woman don't you're not an
(55:06) endocrinologist and you're not a neurochemist why do I need and you're not a biologist and you're not doing a
(55:12) lab test on them no you don't have to be those things yeah you're saying you're saying it's just by me looking at them
(55:17) right well that's correct but by the same metric then I could just determine that they're not a woman the answer is
(55:23) is that you're not lying right it could be something as you know mistaken don't know that or they genuinely do have that
(55:31) neurochemical link that causes the gender in congruence it is and and by
(55:36) your very metric that would make transgender women women you have so I'm
(55:42) going to give you the I'm going to give you the fault the basis of the basic I'm going to give you the fault in your argument again right because it makes no
(55:49) [ __ ] sense there's a truth of the matter and then a subjective metric all your argument is reduced to is saying
(55:55) that based on the fact that you can be trick that makes it so that's it and so the thing is is like no that doesn't
(56:02) make it so the truth of the matter is there still stop stop bro shut up bro let me talk bro shut up bro shut up shut
(56:08) up shut up stop talking anyway so back to this before you cut me off right the
(56:15) answer to this is very simple a male and female have specific categorizations
(56:20) you've admitted it yourself XX or XY or they they produce small or large gametes
(56:25) or uh you know etc etc the truth is is there's only two Pathways a human body can take one is male and one is female
(56:33) all human beings on planet Earth are either male or they're either female that's it sex is that's not the case
(56:38) because the well no it's it's bodal it's not binary there's different uh there's
(56:44) different well you've even admitted okay then give me the threshold breaker give me the threshold Breer yourself and
(56:49) you've you've uh acknowledged that uh for example conditions such as
(56:55) congenital adren hyperplasia or Androgen insensitivity syndrome exists but still
(57:01) maintain it's not its own sex though no no it's bodal yeah it's not its own sex
(57:07) it's still either male or female result in someone being male or you're still male or female that's it that's why it's
(57:13) bodal yeah but B modality has nothing to do with what I just means bodal means
(57:18) bodal would still be AUM and then there's a bit of a spectrum in the middle right and that's where trans are
(57:24) you saying there's a third sex sir what no I I did not ever anti I great then
(57:29) there's only two Sexes and there only can be males and females yes well there's bodal there's aspects where the
(57:37) typical things that you can see of someone being male or female and then
(57:42) there are P parts of it which could differ such as congenital adrenal
(57:48) hyperplasia or Androgen insensi but that doesn't create a new sex category yes because it's bodal so then
(57:55) you still would fall under male or female correct it's bodal so you would still fall under male or female could
(58:01) you fall under male and female or is it always male or fale yes there are people who are interex where the genital
(58:08) aberation is so intense that it that it is difficult to uh establish whether I
(58:15) noticed you use a loaded word there difficult yes it's difficult that doesn't mean anything it doesn't matter
(58:21) the difficulty you an example I want you to give me an example of anybody on planet Earth who both male and female
(58:27) and it cannot be discerned which yes let me allow me to explain show me a chimera real quick way that yes so typically the
(58:34) way that we determine well I'm I'm unfortunately I I should not be showing you that on stream I promise you would
(58:39) do not want to see it uh but the the I'll explain it to you so there are
(58:45) certain instances of genital aberration that make it very difficult to determine
(58:52) whether or not that they are in fact male or female way that we determine somebody to be male or female is
(58:58) typically we look at their genitals and then observe whether or not that they have a a penis or or a vagina very
(59:05) simple yeah it is very simple now yes however there's instances where that's not necessarily obvious take for example
(59:13) we look at somebody and we can observe that their labia is perfectly fused
(59:19) together to form a ball sack this is an instance where somebody is neither uh
(59:25) effectively male or female yeah they still have XY XX doctor that's that's
(59:30) correct but that doesn't result in that sex what all of them go down only two
(59:36) Pathways pause pause what typically happens in a situation like this is that
(59:42) the doctor has to take a genital aberration such as this they usually do an x-ray and say for example in this
(59:49) instance conal adrenal hyperplasia they have a fused labia to create a ball sect
(59:56) they do an x-ray and they determine that say there's uh at least a uterus as well
(1:00:01) as a vagina inside the labia well the answer of what they do is they simply
(1:00:06) cut it open and then they suture together Albia right and they walk because they females because they females it's totally possible that they
(1:00:14) could be XY for example that could happen that happens still make you can still make
(1:00:21) the determination based on game Pathways you still could make the determination again again it's by modal it's not as
(1:00:27) simple all you're doing is making my point for me so let me just let me go ahead and make my argument now okay so
(1:00:34) what he just said to you was yes Andrew it is true sex is but sex is bodal I say
(1:00:40) no it's binary the way that I can prove to you that it's binary is because every person on earth is either male or female
(1:00:46) he says no except for intersex cases like chimerism nope he then goes on to say actually Andrew what it is is you
(1:00:54) can have chimerism and and let's say for instance that your labia grows into a ball sack they will then after they
(1:01:01) determine that you're a female which is actually pretty simple to do based on your physiological pathway you can only
(1:01:06) have one reproductive pathway they go nope you're supposed to be a female and so then they'll go ahead and cut your
(1:01:11) ball sack open and it'll go back to being a labia that's an aberration and mutation doesn't make them any less
(1:01:17) female any more than a woman who had all of her arms and legs cut out and her
(1:01:22) ovaries blown out and all of that is still woman and still a female this idea
(1:01:28) stop talking bro my turn to make the counterargument didn't interrupt you once the idea here that for instance we
(1:01:35) cannot tell whether or not these people are male and female is insane we always can in all cases of chimerism we have
(1:01:42) been able to every single one of them we've been able to and it's so rare by the way there's like 10 there's like 10
(1:01:49) on all of planet Earth maybe and on top of that these interex mutation condition
(1:01:56) have nothing at all to do with transgenderism zero to do with transgenderism it's a classic interex
(1:02:02) bait and switch on the trans question because when we try to identify what is female and male we know exactly what
(1:02:10) female and male is we know and we can determine it 100% of the time for 100% of people that's the big lie that he's
(1:02:17) trying to Pedal you right now all these people that he can show you uh have an interex condition have all been
(1:02:23) determined to be female or male even if it's with Y chromosomes or XX even if
(1:02:28) it's with these aberration and mutations we can always determine if they're male and female therefore we always know what the standard of male and female is him
(1:02:35) asking me subjectively how I categorize and if I can be tricked into somebody being a a woman even though I literally
(1:02:43) give the definition of it has to be an adult female yes I can be tricked to the contrary it doesn't make it true though
(1:02:49) there is a truth of the matter well I've already unfortunately explained it to you and I did try to
(1:02:56) stay on topic regarding uh whether or not that trans women are women and I've
(1:03:02) walked you through the logic and got you effectively to answer that trans women are in fact women by your very metric
(1:03:10) and and so decided that we were going to move well dogs can be cats too you can trick me into the dog being a cat to
(1:03:16) move well hold on unfortunately I'm not going to allow you to yeah you go ahead and then I'll make the argument
(1:03:22) afterwards and destroy you again I wanted to read you a quick Passage of uh of no how about you don't and you just
(1:03:28) give me an argument well this is the argument right I think it's a very good one uh we ask new parents is it a girl
(1:03:35) or is it a boy and assume that the answer will be easy penis and scrotum Define a boy clitoris and labia a girl
(1:03:42) however parents and even pediatricians sometimes find it difficult to answer the seemingly simple question this is
(1:03:47) because some children are born with interex conditions where the external genitalia are ambiguous neither clearly
(1:03:53) male nor clearly female this type of inter sex condition where the genitalia are so ambiguous that the sex assignment
(1:03:59) is difficult probably occurs in one in 12,000 births in addition the incidence
(1:04:05) of interex births depends on to some extent on how intersex is defined certain conditions that involve less
(1:04:12) extreme genital aberration sometimes are also referred to as intersects these includes for instance hypospadius where
(1:04:19) the urethra does not reach the tip of the penis but the genitalia are clearly those of a male if all such syndromes
(1:04:26) are included interex births can be thought as frequent as one in 100 so you
(1:04:33) said that there's like 10 of them unfortunately Chas not inter that's I've I've already explained
(1:04:41) those aren't chimeras what's a chimera stupid I wanted to go back unfortunately to transgenderism in the cir Chimas not
(1:04:48) intercept way mean by Chimera doesn't you don't know what a chimera is we're talking about interex people point that
(1:04:54) I was trying to point to you is whether or not that you're determining somebody to be a woman you've already tasked let
(1:05:00) me ask you a question in all those Cas they DET whether they were male or female you look at them and then the way
(1:05:06) that you look at them is depending on the phenotypes and if they have those phenotypes they as far as you're aware
(1:05:14) are a woman therefore trans women are women you have tacitly agreed with that
(1:05:19) you have lost the debate okay so then I just want to make sure I just want to make sure uh do can dog be
(1:05:27) cats that's a taxonomic classification that's not the same as trans women yeah
(1:05:33) answer the question can dogs be cats again I've told you that's a taxonomic my [ __ ] question with yes
(1:05:41) cats from a taxonomic category okay yeah great can they be from my subjective
(1:05:46) category from I mean you could mistake a dog is being a cat that's the end of
(1:05:51) your argument then I'm making the same you're making the same argument I'm making humans aren't dogs or let me show
(1:05:57) you let me show the audience the a yeah let me show the audience the bait and
(1:06:02) switch it's really simple here's the bait and switch no you're doing the bait switch flying dogs and cats to I just
(1:06:09) let you go through your whole quote and [ __ ] my turn so here is where he's making the bait and switch right and
(1:06:16) this is very low tier even for a leftist um no leftist would ever accept this by the way no actual Progressive or
(1:06:22) scientifically minded person would ever accept this in a million years here's the classification difference he says if
(1:06:28) we're going to categorize cats and dogs that's a taxonomical categorization and so subjectively sure you can be fooled
(1:06:35) into believing that a cat could be a dog with your eyeballs but you would be wrong however when I make that same
(1:06:41) argument to him about men and women that's a taxonomical categorization because it is uh male and female human
(1:06:48) beings taxonomical categorization I can be fooled in those categories he says
(1:06:53) well then therefore you must accept that they're men or their women it's a great bait and switch but it doesn't mean
(1:06:59) anything actually your logic what you're making right now is called a categorization error it's a fallacious
(1:07:04) form of argumentation the category is to say that because subjectively you can be fooled the truth of the matter no longer
(1:07:10) matters the truth of the matter still does matter you saying that if I can mistake a dog for being a cat it's still
(1:07:16) not the case that it is is the same argument that I'm making to you that I can trick you into believing perhaps
(1:07:23) that I'm a woman but it would not make it so yeah you know it's interesting you said
(1:07:29) that the category is wrong which is actually interesting because I used your
(1:07:34) category which is unfortunate I allowed you to walk yourself through what was my
(1:07:39) category well because I was talking to you and how you determine somebody to be a woman and by your very own no because
(1:07:47) we're talking about whether or not trans women or women yeah that would be fale is my cation how you determine somebody
(1:07:53) to be a woman I told you they have to be answer was you look at them
(1:08:00) and got defeated in your argument what was my answer bro my answer was they had
(1:08:05) to be a female that was my literal answer to you yes you started by saying that they are a female the sex that is
(1:08:12) typically associated with reproduction but we've already come to the conclusion that you don't pull people's pants down
(1:08:19) because you're not in prison right now we well okay so then how you determine to somebody to be a this would apply to
(1:08:26) the same argument for cats and dogs orans this would reply the same way for cats and dogs that's why you're making a
(1:08:32) category error so the reduction the the reductive logic you're using they are in
(1:08:39) fact a Woman by your metric no by my metric they're not because they have to be female metric no here's your argument
(1:08:46) to me your argument to me is just simply this your argument is you're not pulling their pant Andrew Andrew what is a woman
(1:08:53) well I say a woman has to be a female you say missing information that this person is a female could you categorize
(1:09:00) them still absent that and be tricked into believing something which is not true the answer is yes but if I use the
(1:09:07) same logic with cats and dogs or anything else you would agree and say no you're wrong you can faulty you can
(1:09:13) faultily come to that conclusion but that doesn't make it so that's my argument to you you're not even engaging
(1:09:19) with it you're trying to go through a bizarre um Phil like a philosophical logic tree that doesn't work in this
(1:09:26) case because it's acious category error here's the category error woman must be
(1:09:31) female woman must be female now can you can me Andrew Wilson subjectively
(1:09:38) categorize somebody falsely as being a female who is not yes just like Andrew
(1:09:44) Wilson could falsely categorize a cat as being a dog I would still be wrong so
(1:09:49) the thing is is like that does not prove that trans women are women if the category of woman requires female why
(1:09:56) are you not getting this well yeah because uh I asked you how you determine
(1:10:01) somebody to be a female yeah so we would use the determination said if they have the
(1:10:07) reproductive or I said the way you determine somebody to be a female is that said that I never said reproductive
(1:10:13) orans never said reproductive orans said the audience will be able to see yeah
(1:10:18) they'll hear my definition 15 times it is one who is typically associated with the ability to reproduce written down
(1:10:25) yes that sex typically associated with reproduction I wrote down exactly what you said yes and so but you're asking me
(1:10:32) for a definition female not a scientific down no the question is whether or not trans women or women not what they're
(1:10:38) not wom talked about females the other problem is that is that you said that uh
(1:10:44) that I am taking you through some philosophical logic Theory unfortunately that's also incorrect because I can
(1:10:51) prove it to be the case not just from uh not just from uh your perceived logic
(1:10:58) Theory but actually your own logic that you just walked yourself through and
(1:11:04) refuse to acknowledge the fact so give me give it to me give it also proven at
(1:11:09) a neurochemical level let's try let's try it this way to a can you give it to me in a syllogism so that I can actually
(1:11:15) understand what you're talking about because it it literally just sounds the logic tree right I don't have a syllogism ready for you but I mean if
(1:11:21) you want I could spend the time take a minute take a minute put it in a Sy for me to write it okay because it's just
(1:11:28) it's just plain equivocation I don't even understand what you're talking about this point give me give me a quick moment okay I'll give you a quick moment
(1:11:34) to put it into syllogism because I actually don't understand this it makes no sense to me yep yep you're just saying that if a person can trick you
(1:11:41) that that makes it true that makes no sense then you ask me for the definition of what a woman is and I give you a the
(1:11:47) definition of one who is typically associ you determine someone to be a woman not that's different so you're
(1:11:52) asking me about a scientific versus you determine well you would determine and I gave you the criteria for the
(1:11:58) determination too it would be all sorts of different things it be XX it' be large gites it would be all sorts of different things which would make such a
(1:12:05) determination scientifically however you could make the determination absent uh you know
(1:12:11) something scientific but all you're saying is that if I can trick you I'm the thing that's insane yeah give me a second to come up
(1:12:18) with my syllogism if you could just just go over to Google AI and put it in a syllogist just do it that way Google AI
(1:12:24) yeah you are come on [ __ ] lie you're going to put it in me a moment allow go ahead go
(1:12:31) ahead we got just have to wait for a sec sorry no problem in the meantime I want to remind you folks first we'll have the
(1:12:38) Q&A shortly we'll read through your questions you can submit those at the live chat here at modern day debate and
(1:12:44) I also just put a poll in the live chat here at modern day debate on YouTube it
(1:12:49) is whose arguments have you found most persuasive tonight so so feel free to
(1:12:56) log in at that poll and let us know who you found most persuasive tonight as first amender gets uh what he's looking
(1:13:03) for want to remind you both of our guests are linked in the description so you can find more content of first
(1:13:09) amender as well as Andrew in the description box below that includes at the podcast so we do have a podcast for
(1:13:15) modern day debate and at the podcast we put our guest links in the description box as
(1:13:20) well ready for you first amender yeah I apologize olog you're going to have to
(1:13:25) give me some time to to come up with it it takes time to come up with a syllogism unfortunately I'm so
(1:13:32) sorry we want to remind you folks if you haven't yet hit that like button we do appreciate that support thrilled to have
(1:13:38) both of our guests tonight it has been a while uh we had first amender on maybe last week but Andrew Wilson is back we
(1:13:47) are collaborating we don't uh let's see we
(1:13:52) think that grudges are effeminate and so we said hey no hard feelings we're open
(1:13:58) to collaborating we hope all the best for Andrew just like we do for all of our guests come on to modern day debate
(1:14:06) and you have a lot of questions so I will give you a chance first am mender we are going to uh let's
(1:14:13) see we're going to go into the Q&A probably you guys cool with maybe going in at about uh 9:30 eastern time so in
(1:14:20) other words I mean yeah we can I wouldn't mind extending this though I actually because at this point there's
(1:14:27) so many fallacies which have been used in this debate um that I'm actually having trouble understanding this
(1:14:33) position of and I I actually do need this one written out I don't usually ask for this in a debate but this one I
(1:14:39) don't actually even understand what the hell this guy is talking about makes no sense to me like I lit I literally actually need
(1:14:47) this one written so that I can see it because it makes no sense to me so uh all all that I hear is uh that there's
(1:14:53) two well I don't I even know at this point I'm uh I'm I'm confused there's
(1:14:59) way better trans Debaters than this but this this one is something else man this one's something else anyway yeah to the
(1:15:05) MDD audience uh from The Crucible let's see here let me just double check see
(1:15:10) where we're at I think we're sitting somewhere around 5,000 live over on The Crucible side just wanted to say take a
(1:15:18) moment go over subscribe to James's Channel it was very kind of him to welcome me back uh I totally agree with
(1:15:24) him and every capacity I do not hold grudges and um there's no good reason to not in this space and uh by the way
(1:15:31) Trump won and so we'll do we'll do like the uh the Jubilee thing right if Trump wins and let all former debts be paid
(1:15:39) right because Trump has won and so maybe me and James can at least come together on that right you voted for Trump right
(1:15:45) James well I do want to say thank you for your recommendation for people to subscribe and I do want to say folks
(1:15:51) Andrew host debates at The Crucible it is a debate platform similar to modern day debate so if you are watching modern
(1:15:58) day debate got to tell you we want regardless of where the debate happens we do want to give people uh awareness
(1:16:05) of where those debates are occurring because even if they're not a monary debate we want people to hear both sides on these different issues so we don't
(1:16:12) host as many as MDD does we host um you know we host maybe uh four or five a month you know what I mean we don't we
(1:16:18) don't we don't host nearly as many as we used to so the platform of The Crucible has moved over to an entertainment
(1:16:25) platform part of entertainment of course is debates and we will always do debates here but we'll never do them in the same
(1:16:30) frequency MDD does highly encourage folks there are plenty of debates to check out over there and uh oh yeah yeah
(1:16:38) for forgive me first amender I'm so sorry I just want to address it just because it's uh it's been almost a year or so and uh I had know football coach
(1:16:45) we were like ninth grade he said you know I was like guys you know if you get in fights it's just like men can you
(1:16:51) know they punch each other and then 5 minutes later they're they're like H it's done you know move on it's over
(1:16:57) that's how we are but first matter I want to give you a chance go ahead the floor is all yours I did have somebody
(1:17:02) say that I use chat GPT what a shame I like to write I write quite a bit and I am capable of making my own
(1:17:09) syllogisms so uh premise one you determine someone to be a Woman by
(1:17:14) looking stop stop hang on hang on do it real slow so I can write it out so I can actually see the
(1:17:20) argument so premise one you determine someone to be a Woman by looking at them
(1:17:26) right because initially you said if they are female and as in the sex typically associated with reproduction
(1:17:33) unfortunately possible because okay premise two woman is based on the
(1:17:39) phenotypes which are typical of
(1:17:45) female okay premise three is trans women can possess phenotypes typical of that of
(1:17:52) females
(1:18:00) premise four if a trans woman has enough phenotypes they appear to be a
(1:18:15) woman okay therefore you determine a transwoman to be a woman
(1:18:25) so the conclusion is therefore you determine trans woman to be a
(1:18:32) woman okay so let me make sure I got this right uh premise one you determin somebody to be a Woman by looking at
(1:18:41) them yes okay I reject I reject premise one oh so now you're are contradicting
(1:18:47) yourself on your initial basis on how you determine someone to be a woman why I wanted hold on hold on M you're reject
(1:18:55) because uh unfortunately contradicting yourself I said how do you determine someone to be a woman you say that they
(1:19:02) are female stop stop I just want I just need a clarification of Who You is in this case you you me personally right
(1:19:09) yes you personally okay me personally yes you personally okay so you is not being used in this case as like a
(1:19:16) collective of us right correct so how you are determining somebody to be a woman is you initially answered saying
(1:19:23) if they are female I said what does that mean and you said if they have the sex
(1:19:28) which is typically associated with reproduction I said okay so you're walking down the street you go up to a person you uh uh you pull down their
(1:19:35) pants and You observe them well we've come to the conclusion that you're not in jail right now so you probably do not
(1:19:41) in fact use sex to uh determine uh that that uh if they have reproductive organs
(1:19:47) to determine if they are in fact a woman okay and so I finally after enough uh
(1:19:53) look I'm fine with aism you look at them I'm fine with this listen I'm fine with the
(1:19:59) syllogism all I'm doing is just asking clarification so just real quick very very clear uh uh clarifications you in
(1:20:06) premise one is Andrew so therefore all 's after this is referring to Andrew
(1:20:12) correct so it would be you Andrew determine someone to be a Woman by looking at them right that's premise one
(1:20:19) you Andrew it matters if it's Andrew or no it matters it m can you just clarify is you Andrew in premise one or
(1:20:26) not let's say it is collective it is it is a it can't be oh bro okay well then
(1:20:31) here I'm going to give you the counter cogis I'm not aware of anybody I'm going to give you the counter I know maybe
(1:20:37) somebody is blind and they hang on stop bro stop it's my turn I'm going to give you the counter syllogism you determine
(1:20:42) somebody to be or a dog to be a cat by looking at them premise two um a dog is
(1:20:49) phenotypes based on whatever dog is premise three can possess can can
(1:20:56) possess the phenotypes of females a cat can possess the phenotypes of a dog
(1:21:02) premise four if a dog has enough cat phenotypes they appear to be a dog therefore uh you determine cats can be
(1:21:11) dogs corre again the problem no let's walk through it we're going to walk through it how do you DET we're going to
(1:21:18) walk through your taxonomic differen we're going to walk through youris that occur specific walk through your let
(1:21:26) premise one not an let's give CH to walk walk through premise one you determine
(1:21:32) somebody to be a Woman by looking at them sir premise one how do you determine a cat to be a
(1:21:38) cat how do I determine I look at the phenotypes by how they look by looking
(1:21:45) at them look them sure okay I look at them okay so great so premise one write it down you determine some a cat to be a
(1:21:52) cat by looking at them uh yeah but the problem okay stop stop
(1:21:58) bro stop we're going through your syllogism bro stop bro stop we're going through your syllogism we're going
(1:22:05) through your syllogism going through your syllogism no it's an invalid critique how bro I don't understand I
(1:22:12) don't understand I don't get it we're going through it's youris homp I am talking about homos why won't
(1:22:20) you let me go through the syllogism James because it's invalid your premise syllogism is invalid no your syllogism
(1:22:28) is invalid because you're applying differences in taxonomic classifications when I'm [ __ ] are you stupid if listen
(1:22:37) listen homp first M if you want to kind of uh critique on Andrews but I do want
(1:22:44) to give a chance just because it is your own syllogism that you laid out it is his own syllogism I'm just walking
(1:22:49) through it yeah by how do you you deter a CID sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm
(1:22:56) sorry letter I need to work with me here let's give apologize I apologize go yeah
(1:23:01) great uh so premise one you determine a cat to be a cat by looking at them
(1:23:09) correct yes okay great uh premise two you say a woman is phenotypes based on
(1:23:16) female right correct yes okay so I'm guessing that a cat is phenotypes based
(1:23:23) on feline yes okay great so that's premise two premise three uh trans women can possess
(1:23:30) the phenotypes of females premise three cats can possess the phenotypes of
(1:23:36) dogs those are different taxonomic classic you answer my question please
(1:23:41) invalid can't cats inv can't wait cats can't possess the phenotypes of dogs no
(1:23:48) they can't there are different tax and first of all no no the premise the entire premise not that they can't
(1:23:54) possess phenotypes of dogs but that the premise itself because you're talking about okay great no no I'm just asking
(1:24:01) stop stop with that but now it's my turn for the counter syllogism can cats
(1:24:06) possess the phenotypes of dogs yes okay great so if trans women can possess the
(1:24:12) phenotypes of females so in this case premise three right cats can possess the
(1:24:18) phenotypes of dogs correct no they can't some but okay well then they can
(1:24:25) okay great so then premise four so then premise four if a cat has enough phenotypes they appear to be a
(1:24:32) dog uh if a or I'm sorry if a cat has enough phenotypes they appear to be a dog that would be correct right if a cat
(1:24:39) had enough dog phenotypes they would appear to be dog the way that we kind of
(1:24:45) determine a cat to be a cat and a dog to be a dog being that phenotype if I I
(1:24:51) suppose like if they had enough phenotypes be a dog okay makes sense so if a dog
(1:25:02) unifications stop bro stop we're just going through the syllogism so if a cat had enough phenotypes that they they
(1:25:09) they could appear to be a dog right that is how we typically
(1:25:15) taxonomically things so then my conclusion okay great
(1:25:21) so my conclusion of this uh is then uh therefore you can determine that cats
(1:25:28) can be dogs so so just to give you your SYM back because of the difference in hang on stop bro and then you can
(1:25:33) respond just stop just stop and then you can respond all you [ __ ] want just stop for a second so here's your
(1:25:40) syllogism back to you just so that you understand writing it down basis of
(1:25:45) everything go ahead you determine uh cats to be cats by looking at them
(1:25:50) that's premise one premise two uh a cat is the phenotypes based on feline
(1:25:57) premise three uh a cat can possess the phenotypes of a dog premise for if a cat
(1:26:04) has enough phenotypes they can appear to be a dog therefore you determine that
(1:26:10) dogs can be cats that is your syllogism back to you you [ __ ] idiot hey Andrew
(1:26:16) for the final time and the the what the 12th time now we're talking about
(1:26:23) taxonomic differences I'm stuck on just Homo sapiens sapiens so just on the
(1:26:29) basis of your premise it doesn't work why it's the same exact argument back because we're talking about Homo Sapien
(1:26:36) sapiens yeah and in this case we're talking about fomic
(1:26:42) categories yeah listen it is a taxonomical category do you believe do you agree with me that homos sapiens
(1:26:49) there that you have males and females who are Homo sapien huh what there are male and
(1:26:56) female Homo sapiens there are yeah yes okay and there so there has to be a way
(1:27:01) so then there has to be a way to make a determination between which or male and which or female right yes okay so since
(1:27:08) we can determine that there has to be a way to determine which are male and which are female in this case we're
(1:27:13) doing the exact same criticism back the other way I agree with you that we can determine all sorts of things
(1:27:19) biologically for what makes a cat however your syllogism here is just based on object ly observing these
(1:27:25) things so if you're just observing it you can make the mistake the syllogism you gave back to me is the same one I
(1:27:31) gave back to you and you came to an unsound conclusion your argument is
(1:27:37) invalid be and I just demonstrated how it's invalid no it's an invalid literally
(1:27:44) it's an unsound it's unsound the conclusion does not follow from the premise you are wrong sir and you need
(1:27:49) to retract this no unfortunately I'm going to let you know one more time
(1:27:55) we're Stu on Homo sapiens sapiens not taxonomic classifications I have used your very
(1:28:01) own is a homo Sapient taxal classification by that basis that is correct it is a taxonomic class what are
(1:28:07) you talking about bro because I'm not comparing homo Sapient sapians to say neander tal lensis they are two separate
(1:28:14) taxonomic classifications I am referring to but the arguments transwoman and a
(1:28:19) woman are still Homo sapiens sapiens so bringing up taxonomic classifications in
(1:28:26) order to make it absurd is a false equivocation there's no equivocation it's your same argument so I have fed
(1:28:34) you a that way you correct just real quick I just want
(1:28:39) to make sure we get metrics have agreed with the syllogism and so have test in
(1:28:44) fact I reeden are women I rejected your syis I rejected your syllogism under the
(1:28:51) same basis as mine but the reality is is that your very logic leads you to this
(1:28:56) conclusion this is incredible so so just real quick just so you know I am listening I just I'm getting water okay
(1:29:02) I used the exact same rejection you did that it was a category error that was
(1:29:08) the same exact rejection that I used what you tried to do stop bro stop bro just let me respond I used the same
(1:29:15) exact rejection that you used it was a category error I told you it was a category error to begin with when I
(1:29:20) wrote when you wrote this syllogism out all I have to do is write it back the other direction and you're completely destroyed what
(1:29:27) isric what is a valid argument I used your own metric no you didn't use my syllogism is an advance is an example of
(1:29:35) a valid Val what is a valid argument peeed it to you what is a valid argument
(1:29:41) look it up look it up if you need to look it up if you need to what is a valid argument an example of a valid argument
(1:29:48) could be a syllogism that's that's yeah I know but what is a valid argument a a valid argument such a
(1:29:56) complex question it's not a complex question but pull it up it kind of is you're refering specifically to a I
(1:30:02) suppose if it's like sound or that I I mean I assume sound is a different allow
(1:30:08) me to allow me sound is different than valid allow me to finish okay I'm allowing you to finish sound is
(1:30:13) different than valid so I mean a valid argument I would have to say that it
(1:30:20) must abide by uh The Logical uh axiomatic premises you know such as like
(1:30:27) you know the law of universal uh non-contradiction you know things like that and then what does that have to do
(1:30:34) with we no you can make valid arguments even if they're uh they could have contradictions in them uh perhaps and
(1:30:41) still be valid uh depends on how you want to preference them but do you know what a sound a sound AR well I don't
(1:30:47) know where you're leading me there I suppose do you know what a sound argument is I don't know where you're leading me I don't I'm just asking you
(1:30:54) very basic very basic questions I mean I can I could try my best but you know without Google searching I I don't know
(1:31:00) off the top of Google Search I want to make sure we're on the same page valid versus sound argument so that you
(1:31:11) know if you think you have a friend who might enjoy this debate folks don't forget to hit that share button you can
(1:31:18) share it around and uh we do appreciate it we uh appreciate you being here tonight hope you had a nice little day
(1:31:24) it was a sunny day a little chilly here but very nice sunny sound versus valid so that you
(1:31:32) know okay so I see what you're trying to uh argue like for example if you say
(1:31:39) like all dogs are fish buddy is a dog therefore buddy is a fish the argument is valid because the conclusion
(1:31:45) logically follows from the premises however it is not sound it's not sound okay so then so then your example is not
(1:31:52) sound no because I'm referring Toom I'm youate things Homo Sapien sapiens right and I
(1:32:00) am not making strict taxonomic differences in classification because trans women and women are in fact uh the
(1:32:08) same taxonomic category St let's just talk at this point so that you understand your argument that is not s
(1:32:13) can can we just talk at this point so that you understand tell the viewers real quick what is the difference between a valid argument and a sound
(1:32:21) argument I I just I just explain yeah do it again though uh so you could say for
(1:32:28) example premise is all dogs are fish Bud he is a dog therefore bu he is a fish
(1:32:33) the argument is technically valid because the conclusion logically follows from the premises however it is not
(1:32:39) sound it is not sound the first premise is false because the the conclusion doesn't actually follow from the
(1:32:46) premises so you can have premises which are all valid so you can have a valid argument which is unsound in this case
(1:32:52) you made an argument which was was valid it was just unsound that's why I gave you your argument back stop bro stop bro
(1:32:59) stop just wait I'll let I'll let you respond bro I'll let I'll let you respond agreed every premise calm down
(1:33:07) calm down your cop laughing is not helping you here I told you all dogs are fish just why do you keep on sping why
(1:33:15) do you keep sping calm down I'm not sping you need to chill you need to chill chill all of them are sound then
(1:33:22) yes the argument is dude calm down calm down calm down all right let's go with Andrew what have you got okay so in this
(1:33:29) case right sure the premises were valid but it was an unsound argument the conclusion doesn't follow you can come
(1:33:35) to false conclusions with valid arguments that's what you did you came
(1:33:41) to an unsound conclusion what you did what you've done here is if you go back
(1:33:46) and you watch the video and you'll see you ask spe hyp specific questions like
(1:33:52) how do you Andrew Define X thing so I Define it this way but then you say but
(1:33:57) wait you didn't use a scientific definition but you didn't ask me what that was so as we went through the
(1:34:03) debate you were able to uh come up with a syllogism which was valid but totally
(1:34:09) unsound that's why the argument is rejected and that's why I asked it for from you in a syllogism form to show you
(1:34:16) the fault in your logic you are making a basic category error because you're
(1:34:21) making a basic category error and you're vered in philosophy you don't even know how bad you [ __ ] up here and I'm
(1:34:28) trying to help you you might think that I'm the mean fascist and I I saw your DMs right oh Andrew is not popular blah
(1:34:35) blah blah hugely vastly popular on the right because I'm really [ __ ] good at this you sir do not understand what you
(1:34:42) just did you made an argument which was valid but unsound by your own metric
(1:34:48) when I gave it back to you in the future my suggestion is that you come into these debates a little more good faith
(1:34:55) and then you won't make such insane [ __ ] mistakes going forward and with that I'll leave it there like I'm fine
(1:35:01) with the debate ending there unfortunately Andrew I've listed
(1:35:07) to you every uh premise and you've agreed with every premise and for the sake of
(1:35:12) arguing okay so if you agree with every premise that means that it's sound if I
(1:35:18) started with say a no if I agree with your premises it doesn't make it sound
(1:35:23) sat there and okay I said for example that all dogs are fish and you say I
(1:35:33) agree then you would think it sound no that doesn't even follow you're so dumb
(1:35:38) yeah so dumb bro you're so dumb all right man well unfortunately you've
(1:35:44) already admitted that trans women are women so you lost the debate to this dumb guy we're going to jump into the Q&A do
(1:35:51) want to say folks thanks for your questions we're going to try to move fast so we get through all of these and reminder we have that poll in the old
(1:35:57) live chat right now on who you found most persuasive tonight this first question coming in from some of these
(1:36:03) are comments we allow during the Q&A comments if they use of Super Chat so Ted nublet says respect for bringing Andrew back glad to have him back and
(1:36:10) thanks for your Super Chat gzilla 37 says logic one Andrew is its
(1:36:16) representative Satan sent a Super Chat said as Bender should too ashamed to
(1:36:22) ever debate again uh I think they mean first amender okay so they said he doesn't even we're glad
(1:36:30) you're here first amender he says he doesn't even understand what circular logic is the fetal oh gosh okay anyway
(1:36:36) we'll give you a chance to respond to that first amender if you'd like yeah I mean if I uh ask if how do
(1:36:43) you determine somebody uh to be a woman and his answer was if they are female
(1:36:49) and so I said so let's say you're walking down the street you go up to a person and you say
(1:36:54) uh uh are are are you female so the way that you determine somebody as woman is if they are female and they are female
(1:37:00) because they are female that's circular yes it has nothing to do with the truth of the matter this is the category or
(1:37:06) you keep making that was something that was directed in me right that's fine I mean yeah that's fine I can I can still
(1:37:11) engage right so but anyway yeah so just so you understand you just you just made a continuous category error the entire
(1:37:18) evening I tried to correct you 100 times you just won't listen this one from Rick's Crystal making and orium says
(1:37:24) greetings first amender we'd like to extend our services to you in the form of a free sponsorship and custom fitted product if you would what is your height
(1:37:32) and size waist of pants that you wear thanks this one from gzilla 37 says Mr
(1:37:37) amender at no point were you even close to anything that could be considered IR rational thought I know what movie this
(1:37:42) is from everyone in this room is now Dumber for having listened to it I award you no points and may God have mercy on
(1:37:48) your soul anybody else know what movie that's from I I do it's from Billy matter
(1:37:54) yeah that's funny okay first uh we'll give you a chance to respond first AER if you'd like I I mean like I I don't
(1:38:01) know what to say to that it just sounded like an insult you got I mean I'm F I feel like I made a logical argument I
(1:38:07) even had to write it down in a sism because he didn't understand it and then after everything is said and done we
(1:38:13) could come we we by his own metrics came to the conclusion that trans women can be women so it's fine like it doesn't
(1:38:21) matter Joe Brandon you know I do I do want you to know you
(1:38:26) could take this moment right cuz I've been blown out in a debate before too right one one or two you could actually
(1:38:33) take this moment to self-reflect right and say okay wait a second hang on maybe I can back track
(1:38:39) here because you can make this argument better I could even show you how to make it better but dude in no way shape or
(1:38:45) form did you even come close you're not even on the same level you're not even in the same [ __ ] Universe you should just stop while you're ahead you're cop
(1:38:52) laughing you're cop is not doing you any favors is that why I had to explain to you a syllogism because I'm not at your
(1:38:58) level bro you didn't even know what a valid or a sound argument was I asked you for a syllogism so I could show you
(1:39:04) the so I could show you the fault in your own logic you just don't even understand you're so stupid you don't
(1:39:10) even understand all right and you still don't understand you're still doubling down you could just you could just take
(1:39:16) the correction and you know we could have actually had a good conversation about this if you had taken the correction you just can't do it this one
(1:39:22) from Jo Brandon says James are you a woman the first uh this one's the tra
(1:39:29) neotraditional noose says first a mendor lost the debate three times at once
(1:39:34) Amazing Joe you just let me know if you want to respond to any of these Joe Brandon says James if you're a woman
(1:39:40) you're a nice looking one thank you it's Quay says question for first amender
(1:39:45) does the definition used by the ioc in Paris quote a woman is a person who has
(1:39:52) the word woman written in their passport unquote justify the loss of two gold
(1:39:59) medals in boxing by CIS women I I I don't know I would have to
(1:40:04) research it I'm sorry I wish I could give you a better answer I just don't know enough about like the passports and
(1:40:11) the the specific definition you've provided unfortunately I apologize oh okay I think they're
(1:40:19) saying a you know from the more from one perspective Ive the gold medal for women's boxing
(1:40:29) was unfairly uh the the whole competition within boxing they're saying because they're defining a woman as
(1:40:35) anyone who has woman written in their passport namely the Olympic Committee and they're saying what about you know James I just
(1:40:42) want to let you know you have failed we never got closing statements oh I didn't remember talking about doing but if you
(1:40:48) guys want closing statements I'm open to that wait don't we always don't we always do them on MD well
(1:40:56) philosophy relig or like religion atheism debates we usually do but not usually for in okay well then never mind
(1:41:02) that's my bad then I'm sorry no problem John Ruck says Trump won I remember my
(1:41:08) first debate Andrew this one from John Ruck they say Trump won America voted trans women are
(1:41:15) male uh you probably disagree with that first amender yeah I mean I don't think that
(1:41:20) like it is a collection of people that come to the conclusion that's just to add populum fallacy i' rather operate
(1:41:28) off of an endocrinological neurological a sociological and a biological basis
(1:41:33) right the science is on my side here oh okay so an appeal to Authority fallacy no because I gave you the arguments I
(1:41:40) can give you the valid arguments so oh he's wrong because it's that popular you're right because it's appeal to Authority great job there no
(1:41:46) unfortunately because I gave you the premises yeah and your premises were flawed I showed you how they were flawed
(1:41:52) like the neurobi logical ones no we could do that in syllogism too God help you if you ever did that it' be even
(1:41:58) worse for you this one coming in from Danny Tanner Turner says first am matter
(1:42:04) what is a woman can men get pregnant what is a woman can men can I'm
(1:42:11) sorry that was was that two questions or two in one what's a woman and then can men get
(1:42:18) pregnant uh generally it's adult human female but it's complicated I mean I it would take me a good five minutes to
(1:42:25) explain it but I mean adult human female but it's also complicated is the
(1:42:30) simplest answer and then as far as the what was the second
(1:42:35) question can men get pregnant yes there are trans men that
(1:42:41) can in fact get pregnant so not men though well they are even by your own metric unless they're males can males
(1:42:48) get pregnant unfortunately even by your own metri yeah can males get can males get pregnant
(1:42:53) I've I've I've already explained yeah I know can males get pregnant are you referring to sex or are you referring to
(1:42:59) gender yeah sex no so if somebody considers only men can be males can then
(1:43:04) if they say men cannot be pregnant are they incorrect but that's not how you determine somebody yeah can I can you answer my question yeah your premise is
(1:43:12) false that's not how you determine someone to be male yeah okay but if a person if a person only determined that
(1:43:19) a person was a man based on their sex repe the same question yeah I know I know until I get an answer I'm going to
(1:43:26) ask you one more time if a person only determined what a man was based on their sex that had to be included in the
(1:43:32) criteria for man right could they could any of those people who they declared to
(1:43:38) be men ever get pregnant again I it's the same exact
(1:43:43) question the determine a a man is uh going to be whether that you're looking
(1:43:49) at them that's how you typically determine it right and so if ypes tyal of that of male you're not
(1:43:56) answering my of course if they were of course possess reproductive organs they could in fact get pregnant trans men can
(1:44:04) get answer my question get pregnant anyway moving on no no not moving on so
(1:44:09) if if if we only classified just real quick if we're only
(1:44:14) classifying man as male could any men
(1:44:20) ever get pregnant yes or no iut trans men can get
(1:44:28) pregnant how do you think that this is going good for you I that's what I don't get I feel like I'm doing great this is
(1:44:34) amazing this one from Joe Brandon thanks says James I respect you you didn't take my messages to Heart of course not
(1:44:39) thanks for that Rachel Wilson says by first amender logic Susan banthony and
(1:44:45) Barbara Bush are not women Andrew wins again first amender you want to respond
(1:44:53) yeah I mean it's possible for a woman to look like a man and you improperly gender them in which case they say hey
(1:45:00) I'm I'm I'm uh my pronouns are she her or I'm I'm a woman then I would simply
(1:45:05) just give them the she her pronouns right position that look like men right
(1:45:11) how do you not understand that you continuously refute your own position I just don't want to I don't get up out of
(1:45:16) bed and then go outside and then think H I kind of want to be a jerk today that's not what I do I I like to treat people
(1:45:24) with respect even that is a reputation of your own position I've already you constantly
(1:45:31) refute your own position it's wild how you don't see it it's a multi you're like oh I can tell that you're not a man
(1:45:37) but I'm going to call you that anyway right but somehow but somehow that's still a valid classification it's
(1:45:43) [ __ ] crazy all right we'll go to the next one this one from merite Catholic
(1:45:49) Aussie says so a woman is reduced to a costume how dare you I'm offended and
(1:45:55) insulted how degrading that all it takes to be a woman is to think and dress like
(1:46:02) one um it's it's okay it'll be okay you'll go to bed and wake up it's okay
(1:46:09) oh great great argument this one I don't know what to tell like I don't know what to tell you like I'm mad I'm offended
(1:46:16) that I have to be respectful towards people how dare they oh God I'm so I'm so upet they get upset that you want
(1:46:22) them to they wear clothes when I go outside they get upset that you want them to lie yeah they get upset by that
(1:46:28) I know and to the modern debate audience you don't have to you don't have to lie to these people [ __ ] these people you
(1:46:34) don't have to lie to them because they really really want you to it's emotional hostage taking they basically want you
(1:46:39) to affirm their lie or else or else they say they're going to hurt themselves you don't have to do that guys you don't
(1:46:45) have to do that [ __ ] this one from Dana McWhite how Jame how small is James's
(1:46:51) head compared to his body Beetlejuice character thank you for that okay so I can I can attest to this hang on I can
(1:46:57) attest to this in person James is properly proportioned I don't know what the [ __ ] camera does to James and I
(1:47:05) see it I see it but in person the guy is properly proportion say what you want male typical traits or female typical
(1:47:12) traits must be the camera camera must be doing something I usually think I have a big noggin Silver Phoenix Rising says
(1:47:19) whatever happened to basic human decency and being respectful to those you ask to
(1:47:25) be C I think they mean just uh they say by the pronouns they
(1:47:31) prefer is that a new term caked or they just mean I'm sorry to repeat that question I'm sorry I I totally spaced
(1:47:38) out I apologize I think that uh I just don't know why it has the word cake like ice
(1:47:46) cream and cake they say whatever happened to basic human decency and being respectful to those you ask to be
(1:47:52) called not caked Sorry by the pronouns they prefer I love that I love you what a
(1:47:59) great person whoever just said that you get hearts hearts you're a good person I appreciate that no Hearts Andrew this
(1:48:08) one from water Walter melon says question for first amend amender is
(1:48:15) pause your safe word I only ask because you keep repeating it whenever you're getting okay never mind made by jimbob
(1:48:23) says first amender if I can trick someone into believing I'm a police officer should I
(1:48:30) be charged for impersonating a police officer uh you should be charged for impersonating a police officer that
(1:48:36) results into a safety concern obviously and not only that usually people who
(1:48:42) impersonate police officers are really have do not have good intentions so well why aren't they police officers well
(1:48:48) it's it's not it's not analogous unfortunately why aren't they police off offers how come they're not I'm saying
(1:48:54) it's a safety concern it's yeah I know but how come they're not police officers because they didn't go to academy and
(1:49:00) they didn't like because they don't they don't meet the criteria necessary yes
(1:49:05) yeah this one coming in from do appreciate it Chase Hatchet says can't
(1:49:11) woman quote unquote just mean female or female presenting all words are made up
(1:49:17) anyways and language evolves constantly
(1:49:24) I I'm so sorry I was reading a horrible comment that somebody sent me I have to
(1:49:29) get I have to look you want to pay attention to the debate bro be a pro at least try to be a professional for five
(1:49:34) minutes listen I'm new to this you got to give me you got to give me a little credit here right I'm doing everything I
(1:49:39) can I don't need to give you any credit I need you to be a pro for five minutes got thousands of people watching you and
(1:49:45) probably alander Hansen for the subscription thank you very much I really appreciate it Chase Hatchet says
(1:49:51) can't woman just mean female or female presenting all words are made up anyways and language evolves
(1:49:59) constantly yes there is an aspect of that yes I completely agree uh with that being said though I tend to be a little
(1:50:06) bit more Aristotelian when it comes to my definitions because I think it's really important to make sure that you
(1:50:13) have some concrete definitions that you can agree on so that way you can lead to concrete conclusions I don't see why you
(1:50:21) you you absolutely refus to come to terms on any definitions of anything ever well I did I mean I no you you took
(1:50:28) two different categories a social category and then you took a biological category and conflated them the entire
(1:50:33) night making multiple categorization errors you should stop doing that really bad it's really bad for you to do that
(1:50:40) bro no but but unfortunately you did as well okay give me the example of how I did yeah so you were talking how dogs
(1:50:48) can be cats when I'm talking about a specific Homo Sapien sapiens and specific
(1:50:56) yeah I understand an internal critique has nothing to do with me making critique you can have an internal
(1:51:02) critique while also having a category error but in this case you haven't pointed out what the category thought
(1:51:07) you were the expert on this you haven't pointed out what the category error was you pointed out that I made an internal critique of your categorization error
(1:51:15) and because I gave you an internal critique of your categorization error you're making it my categorization error is [ __ ] Wild yeah this one coming in
(1:51:24) from bezos's anti-bullying agency says while we can entertain the debate in the
(1:51:29) abstract for fun in reality I knew within two micros seconds of seeing first amender that uh let's
(1:51:38) see never mind on that one Dan they Dana MC white says his is his
(1:51:45) waterfall in 18p it REM it's like an animated waterfall right yeah it it actually
(1:51:51) comes from a fighting game I forget which one it is I just think it's really pretty so I decided to put it in it's
(1:51:59) pretty cool you like it it reminds me of the Jungle Book in Disney it's uh when I was a kid that was
(1:52:06) one of my favorite movies Pamela Hast says to First amender why must I recognize tall muscular beef blied
(1:52:15) obvious males in dresses as women they don't have a fake female phenotype
(1:52:23) oh it's so it's simple uh it's just a matter of respect you know it it really
(1:52:29) come I mean I'll be honest if there was a big Burly person that came up to me and was just like you need to call me a
(1:52:35) woman I'd be like I'm sorry I would say I'm sorry Miss I I'm I apologize I mean
(1:52:40) you can go ahead and do that I mean have fun I mean you're kind of like a jerk and you may you may have some physical
(1:52:46) repercussion for it what makes you a jerk well because it's just being mean like I don't know it's just yeah what
(1:52:51) does mean mean is that subjective objective well subjective doesn't mean it doesn't matter think mean I think
(1:52:58) yeah I think it's mean to force yeah I think it's mean to force people to tell people things that they don't think are true I think that's mean why there's no
(1:53:05) skin off your back it's easy wait wa wait wait who are you to make the determination of what is skin off of
(1:53:10) who's back well I I just think it's easy it's it's okay it's not that big of a deal no
(1:53:16) no that's you making this assertion you to tell somebody else what
(1:53:22) they get offended by would it be okay for me to tell a black person if you called him the nword that's no skin off
(1:53:27) your back what wait you're going to approach a black wait hold wait that's a great example why don't you approach a
(1:53:34) black person and call him me NW well for from my perspective yeah yeah so I would
(1:53:40) look at that as a Christian ethics perspective but the the question the question here is if if you thought that
(1:53:47) there was no it's not because of meanness if there was the idea disrespect it's not just from meanness
(1:53:53) but anyway if it was from the position that you thought that it was not a mean
(1:53:58) thing to say why would that person be wrong and you would be right what well
(1:54:04) again like we've come to the subjective interpretation that the nword is not appropriate to call a uh an
(1:54:12) African-American well who's we or any African for that wa wait you and this guy didn't come to that why why is we
(1:54:19) the humanity that we live in no you why how you tell him he's wrong so you're just
(1:54:25) going to say so it's another argument it's another argument you walk outside your door it's another argument at it's
(1:54:32) a social Norm social norms are like that so it's just an argument ad populum no it's not an argument ad populum a social
(1:54:39) Norm what is a social Norm other than the majority of people do X thing that's
(1:54:44) correct so then it's an argument from it's an argument ad populum so all you're saying is it's it's why don't you
(1:54:51) go up not allowed to say xword because uh socially it's unacceptable right this
(1:54:59) is actually great this one coming in Mr can you answer the [ __ ]
(1:55:05) question I did you didn't you never you never answer any questions I did
(1:55:11) multiple times so if so I just want to make sure I got this right you if it was a social Norm if it was a social Norm
(1:55:17) for you to say the n-word to black men you would do it I I'm sorry to repeat it one more
(1:55:23) time if it was a social Norm to say the nword to black men you would do it like in the 1960s you would do in your
(1:55:29) bizarre world where it is socially it would likely result in that but yeah
(1:55:35) that's kind no would you do it my question is would you do it I mean in today's day and age no but it lik you
(1:55:41) have done it if it was a social Norm would you do itely yes everybody is like that great I love the fact that you
(1:55:48) you're like that as well would run around and say the NW to people if you could get away with it anyway that's not
(1:55:54) what the it is what you just said this one it's so ridiculous Mr enigmatic says
(1:56:00) first amender how would you feel if you hadn't eaten breakfast this morning they said this would be a question on your
(1:56:07) level I don't understand I know I've seen this me yeah how would you feel if you hadn't eaten breakfast this
(1:56:13) morning um well interestingly enough I normally have a diet day today is not a
(1:56:20) diet day so I could eat whatever I want I would probably have considered that if
(1:56:26) I did not eat breakfast today a bit of a waste cuz I'm wasting my cheat day I enjoy my cheat days and so that means I
(1:56:33) get to eat Dunkin Donuts in the morning and so I'd be like why did I not take advantage of that that's there you
(1:56:40) go okay what's the this was a popular meme
(1:56:46) I saw I think it was on uh whatever the whatever podcast is that where it was but basically what's the meaning of this
(1:56:53) is just is this whether or not people it's a it's literally this meme is designed around oh I mean it's total
(1:56:59) nonsense it came from forchan right but the idea here is to see if a person can actually engage with a hypothetical or
(1:57:05) not engage with a hypothetical generally speaking if you ask how a person wouldn't feel or how they would feel if
(1:57:10) they hadn't eaten breakfast this morning you would expect them to say hungry but usually you and the idea here is if they
(1:57:17) don't say that they can't engage with hypotheticals kind of like our friend over here who literally couldn't engage
(1:57:22) with a hypothetical that's that's the point of it whether or not not validity
(1:57:28) I didn't take advant hang on whether or not it has validity or not and it doesn't in any way shape or form because
(1:57:34) it is a meme uh that's what the point of the question is gotcha I thought that's
(1:57:40) what it was okay Pamela this one V VOR Tomy says this guy should be why we
(1:57:46) should do away with the 19th Amendment remind me what's the 19th that's whether or not women that would be the women's
(1:57:52) to vote but am a man a right I believe a
(1:57:57) women ought have a right are you sure yeah I'm I'm a man are you sure
(1:58:04) yeah look here I'll show you I got muscles no no you don't have to you want to see my muscles I want to show you my
(1:58:10) muscles I've been going to the gym Jordan said question for first amender females are not males just as
(1:58:18) cats are not dogs if we using the syllogism your false view fails your own
(1:58:24) reputation do you agree no because I believe that you're referring to a difference in taxonomic
(1:58:31) classification which is operating at a different method than Homo sapiens sapiens I'm sorry me I agree it's a it's
(1:58:38) a different taxonomical classification same argument I us women and women are in the same taxonomic category
(1:58:44) unfortunately no sex is not in the same taxonomical category you
(1:58:50) fool this next question in by the way first men we appreciate you being a good
(1:58:56) sport I know some of these super chats uh seem to be uh they don't like me very much it's okay well I like that you
(1:59:03) smile and you don't get triggered by it Chase Hatchet says so women are different species than
(1:59:11) men yeah exactly they're not that's why yeah great great great Point that's
(1:59:17) that's my point the premise is not correct this one from lier sister
(1:59:22) says oh and then you guys uh felt like on that well we got I think we covered it lier system
(1:59:29) say that's incorrect women women and men falling within the same species because
(1:59:35) there's only and there's only two Sexes would be taxonomically correct there's two and since there's two that would be
(1:59:42) taxonomically correct he's alluding to the fact that there's a third which would be taxonomically incorrect he's
(1:59:48) been rejected on this multiple times he just doesn't listen
(1:59:54) this one coming in from do appreciate it Chase Hatchet you got that one the sophist RoR says hey James why is your
(2:00:00) mod silencing gay voices in the chat I don't think this is true so I I do trust
(2:00:06) Max I don't think he is doing that so I'll check into like nobody I asked in
(2:00:12) chat if they could show me what was silenced it makes me think of uh if
(2:00:17) someone breaks the rules then yeah they'll be silenced if you use some that YouTube won't allow but just because
(2:00:24) they're gay it's like yeah we're silencing a gay but it's not because they're gay it's because they broke the rule so you have to be honest about
(2:00:30) what's going on Chase Hatchet says we got that one bump on a log says first
(2:00:36) amander with sincerity you genuinely are just confused I suggest you read some basic Aristotelian metaphysics you are
(2:00:43) not understanding categories Andrew's counter example is perfectly
(2:00:49) analogous okay uh unfortunately uh he's operating off of
(2:00:56) differences in taxonomic ranks uh not strictly male and female so
(2:01:01) unfortunately it is not uh the same thing uh I recommend anybody to pick up
(2:01:06) an Endocrinology book pick up a neurochemistry book pick up a Modern Biology book hell I mean I pulled up
(2:01:13) this one which is a combination of just both uh psychological uh and
(2:01:19) neurochemical uh and and it determines the the the sex uh sexual
(2:01:24) differentiations and it is called brain gender by Melissa Hines I highly recommend it if you want to learn more
(2:01:31) about uh what exactly is this whole trans thing I think it's a really good uh research right because the academics
(2:01:39) are on my side with this it doesn't matter how many people think I'm wrong here yeah and the polls were on his side
(2:01:45) too another soft science but anyway the IDE right now the idea here is that well
(2:01:52) that's what you just did you just made an appeal at in you said most the academics on side it's an argument at
(2:01:58) populum all of the scientists of the world could be on your side people who don't study this thing all of the
(2:02:03) scientists of the world could be on your side and could still be wrong in any
(2:02:09) case in this in this particular case he's violating the law of identity the
(2:02:14) law of identity is saying in a taxonomical category this thing is this thing and it has criteria around it
(2:02:20) which makes this thing in the case of humanity there's two Sexes that is part
(2:02:26) of the ontology of humanity it's part of the taxonomy of what a human being is so
(2:02:32) because that is the case when he tries to defer away from sex into some other
(2:02:37) category it is not only a taxonomical categorization error it's actually a law
(2:02:44) of identity error as well it is a violation of logic itself and I don't
(2:02:50) understand why I couldn't get him to understand this usually most progressives within 15 minutes we move on to the second state this guy just
(2:02:56) never got it I don't even know what to do with that oh that's right I just remember we
(2:03:02) got another question I missed liger system says trans girls cannot make SL push babies trans males can't get girls
(2:03:13) pregnant um is this not a major issue
(2:03:19) no why not because uh typically the way that you
(2:03:24) determine uh somebody to be uh to be a woman or a man is their phenotypic
(2:03:30) characteristics it's not whether or not that they can have children or there's your category error again so your category error comes in again category
(2:03:36) errors is regarding uh male and female and man and woman right they're different things explain to you their
(2:03:43) the basis they're not different things they're both the same thing no this is the the CR of the categorization ER all
(2:03:51) you're doing is taking a female and and assigning the word man to the word
(2:03:56) female to describe the same phenomenon so all you're doing is saying okay uh
(2:04:01) women which is female and man which is male both of these are adult me adult
(2:04:07) males or adult females all you're doing is assigning the opposite label to them
(2:04:12) and you're saying okay in this particular case now you are a male and now you are a female because you are a
(2:04:19) trans man or transom your characteristics though are still the same this is where you continuously
(2:04:24) violate the law of identity trans men cannot impregnate women and trans women
(2:04:31) cannot be impregnated by men that is the proof of your categorization error you
(2:04:36) fool that's correct typically by sex but we're not they can't they can't because they're the thing that they are the
(2:04:43) thing that they are they can't be what they're not sex and gender right you're now discovering it I love you Andrew
(2:04:49) you're doing oh GE like in my opening statement where said once a social categorization which is meaningless and then you proved it multiple times
(2:04:55) including your own syllogism dummy nope Russell Russ says the guy who put down
(2:05:01) my pet squirrel looked just like first amender the worst part is that he came back to put down my pet raccoon too sad
(2:05:08) monite 23 don't worry for a SM we know it wasn't you they say when did you
(2:05:14) transition okay let's see this when do I when did I transition
(2:05:19) into a man they think that you did but you said before you didn't dromer says
(2:05:26) are you born trans if so was Kaitlyn Jenner the first woman to win the
(2:05:32) decathlon I don't know what Caitlyn Jenner has done I don't follow her okay so Bruce Jenner won the decathalon and
(2:05:39) then later transition I don't know anything about sports man I don't do Sports I I don't
(2:05:45) I'm sorry the catalon it'll be it's just a athletic event so let's just you don't
(2:05:52) have to know about sports they're just saying so are you born Trans in other words was Bruce Jenner already Caitlyn
(2:06:00) Jenner was Bruce Jenner already a woman back in the I think it was like that's a complicated question I would
(2:06:06) probably just ask I would ask her you know likely uh I mean maybe at the time
(2:06:13) that they were Bruce Jenner according to other people that's fine nothing wrong with that okay but let's say for example
(2:06:18) if I ask them in modern day you know hey were you always a woman they' probably say yes okay this fine it's just a
(2:06:25) matter of respect that's all it is I think I understand so they were saying if Bruce Jenner was trans from birth and
(2:06:33) won the decathlon it would have been the first woman that won the decathlon you're saying well no it depends on if
(2:06:38) Bruce Jenner at the time of winning the decathalon considered himself as a woman or as a well they're not in the women's
(2:06:44) competition so it's not the same it's you're talking about the rules regarding the specific sport right and we
(2:06:51) generally separate the sport based on Sexes I mean this is a completely different discussion that I would have
(2:06:57) it's not it doesn't have to be it's like the kathon anybody can win it man or woman and they're just saying you know
(2:07:03) oh is it is it not sex specific I'm sorry I don't know this is why I'm saying I'm not I'm not good with sports
(2:07:09) I like you know if I went into a
(2:07:14) competition that women normally I I went to the WNBA slam dunk contest and I won
(2:07:21) and I'm still identifying as male it'd be like well James won the WNBA slam dun
(2:07:26) contest like well you wouldn't be in there because you identified it as male okay well the decathlon allows anybody
(2:07:32) male or female so they're saying if Bruce Jenner you're saying it depends if Bruce Jenner thought of himself as a man when
(2:07:38) he won the decathlon you're saying well then he was a man but if he thought of himself as a woman then yes it would have been the first woman who won the
(2:07:44) decathlon I see what you're saying I would I would defer to The Experts that make the rules that would be the I I
(2:07:50) know that's kind of a again I don't know enough about that particular sport to Del whether or not
(2:07:57) but why would the committee members only def is by the way I only defer to The
(2:08:03) Experts who are in Russia who say that transgenderism isn't a thing I only defer to those experts okay yeah because
(2:08:10) why not why not just defer to The Experts that we like because the entire world of oh yeah the entire world and
(2:08:17) and neurobiologists and biologists and endocrinologist can you show me all
(2:08:23) these people who don't exist in westan exist in multiple in multiple countries that yeah well you're not going to see
(2:08:29) people that are being able to study Endocrinology in like in in like these like poor quality of living countries
(2:08:36) it's very expensive research because it's hard to put hormones in a Petri dish it's very difficult to isolate
(2:08:42) hormones wait a second I'm I'm super very difficult process I'm super confused why isn't why isn't it that I
(2:08:49) should only appeal to The Experts that I like it's not an appeal to experts that you
(2:08:54) like it's appealing to people that have researched the topic and know about the topic can you tell me about who funds
(2:09:00) these researchers are you saying that there's like a giant conspiracy I don't require a giant conspiracy in order for
(2:09:06) my world viw to be correct I does it matter to you who funds researchers does it even matter sure of course it matters
(2:09:12) like if I told you that most trans studies were backed by Pro lgbtq organizations would that make any sort
(2:09:19) of appeal to you at all would you would you even think twice about it or would you say no that makes sense they
(2:09:25) should uh yeah no it makes sense they should of course of course all right yeah I mean if they're receiving funding
(2:09:31) like why not why not spend some time to research it to ensure that whether or not that there's any basis in the
(2:09:37) validity sure why not I want to increase the rights of all
(2:09:42) people uh let's see Mark says yeah we can read some insults but for some of these you have to stay within reason
(2:09:49) folks okay Marc Mark says first amender what's your this
(2:09:55) one I don't even know what it means what's your favorite color crystal is this like they think you're a new Ager
(2:10:01) or something they're gonna put him in a crystal they're gonna put him in a crystal bro I'm a uh I I'm I'm very
(2:10:08) empirical I'm very scientifically minded I do not uh I I don't believe in any of
(2:10:14) that woo woo stuff unless it comes F studies suppose if you asked like my logo is blue my my first amender
(2:10:22) logo by the way consider subscribing to my channel because I debate all sorts of people if you like my arguments
(2:10:27) subscribe to my Channel at youtube.com first amender one you can't argue why would anybody subscribe to
(2:10:34) your channel hey man it's okay don't worry Gordan C says first amender I'm
(2:10:39) not I'm not worrying but why would anybody subscribe to your you don't know how to argue why would they subscribe
(2:10:44) your Chan you just fine but okay I I like how you caveat it with I feel like
(2:10:50) I feel like you're Co pretty hard that's what I feel like we have to move on Zack
(2:10:55) AER says ask him if trans women should be allowed in women's bathrooms yes
(2:11:01) 100% Jordan C says first amender can't comprehend what Andrew is saying uh
(2:11:07) let's see I'm guessing you disagree with that all right Dion says first amender is it possible
(2:11:14) to be trans and not be aware that you are and if so if Dwayne The Rock Johnson
(2:11:20) was discovered to have the neurochemistry of a female is he now a
(2:11:25) woman uh unfortunately for Dwayne The Rock Johnson he takes so much uh uh
(2:11:32) hormones that inhibit uh towards muscle growth answer the actual question it's
(2:11:37) physically impossible that's not they saying is physically impossible yeah what was his question though do you even
(2:11:43) remember it you don't even remember it they're saying as a hypothetical though let's say it's like it's like if I can
(2:11:48) move 10 miles an hour can I move the speed of light no no you can't the answer is no wait you're saying it's
(2:11:54) logically impossible you're saying it's logically impossible that a person could share the exact same hang
(2:12:01) on exact same brain chemistry of one of these people and not identify as one of
(2:12:07) these people that's logically impossible I mean I guess if he stopped taking all of that and started taking
(2:12:13) like no he's still taking all of that but he he identifies as his thing he
(2:12:18) would impossible destination to yeah so it's logically impossible right no it's
(2:12:25) it's like it's like chemically impossible it's like it's chemically impossible yeah effective so if you take
(2:12:30) a ton of testosterone and you're like a weightlifter you can't be a woman uh oh good question you know you
(2:12:37) probably could honestly if somebody was like well then what are you [ __ ] god you're dumb dude how do you not get the
(2:12:44) well well it's impossible okay what about the well you could it's
(2:12:49) okay like just not going to how the [ __ ] do you how do you even function how do you breathe through your mouth is what I
(2:12:55) want to know uh well I am inhale and then I exhale
(2:13:02) this but let's just do hypothetical that if Dwayne Johnson started going in the
(2:13:08) opposite direction he started taking a ton of uh well let's he just got off the
(2:13:14) steroids replacement therapy well let's say instead he's just going fully natural and he's like I'm not going to
(2:13:21) take any steroids at all of any type like let's say 10 years down the road after all the effects have worn off then
(2:13:28) you know in that scenario if it was discovered that he had the neurochemistry of a female is he now a woman even then those chemical
(2:13:34) destinations would likely be very difficult because even without anything like gentically speaking he has a lot
(2:13:41) the answer is is likely No like is it no it's it's not a yes or no it's okay
(2:13:48) right so so then the answer is yes no the answer they could still be a womanology is complicated comp
(2:13:54) unbelievable so they could still be a woman right do you understand that things don't happen could they still be a woman or operate things at a more why
(2:14:01) will you not answer questions because it's complicated will they could they be that's all he could they be a woman
(2:14:08) still it's theoretic maybe to some level maybe maybe it's but generally no
(2:14:14) generally no genos male a very male could they be a
(2:14:20) woman already explained it stop say yes or no could they or couldn't they so answer
(2:14:28) ID 970 says just want to say first amender won this debate hands down wow
(2:14:34) you say just kidding okay okay mind let's see this this is from let's see oh
(2:14:43) that's funny you're a good sport forer I like that you got thick skin harbar Nar
(2:14:49) says I'm going to be honest I think Andre should stick to the leftist heavyweights like
(2:14:54) Destiny uh let's see they say aticos says I would appreciate the bet you took
(2:15:01) I appreciate the bet you took with me I would hope that you do attend on Saturday so you can see my logic
(2:15:07) tree oh yes yes there was a discussion that I had with a thick toast I was
(2:15:12) certain that uh Kam haris was going to win the election and uh this was based
(2:15:18) off of Alan liman's uh 13 keys to the White House unfortunately he was wrong I
(2:15:25) was willing to bet on the 90% probability that uh he was correct because that was his track record uh
(2:15:31) unfortunately in this situation he was wrong and so I science was wrong relax
(2:15:37) relax relax calm down let me just explain let me you trusted the experts
(2:15:42) bro you trusted the experts so it was it was wrong and it's okay you know and so I I quickly paid him and he said you
(2:15:49) know he said he came to some logical conclusion and I I was just curious as
(2:15:55) to how he came to that logical conclusion that's all because he's not an idiot a thick toast I'm not an idiot
(2:16:02) either no well that remains to be seen we we go to the freak says what's
(2:16:07) logical argument said the guy who has to get who has to get the argument explained to the syllogism because he doesn't understand it but okay no I said
(2:16:13) that was so that I could help you not help me freak says unfortunately it's for you they say the freak says what's
(2:16:21) logical arguing logic in a trans debate I don't know what that means to either
(2:16:26) of you yeah he's he just means he means it's something that's so obvious
(2:16:32) basically every human being logic itself yes at surface level uh it seems like
(2:16:38) that it appears a specific way unfortunately when you read uh the endocrinology and the neurochemistry and
(2:16:44) the biology and in the psychology and the sociology you realize oh wait actually it's more complicated than that
(2:16:51) me pointing out the neurochemical basis behind it and an endocrinological basis behind it shows its validity so that's
(2:17:00) isn't gonna go away just because you want to be trans that's really funny because that's everything right if you could do this with like steel a a metal
(2:17:07) bar the science behind a metal bar is infinitely complex as well you can infinitely complexify anything that you
(2:17:13) want that is actually another form of a fallacious argument so what happen
(2:17:20) happens is uh it's the idea that until you can delineate between point a and point B then a must not exist and B not
(2:17:27) must not exist it's fallacious for a reason everything on planet Earth is
(2:17:33) infinitely complex but he wants you to go off of intuition when you make the discovery very quickly of who is a man
(2:17:39) and who isn't a woman until it conflicts with who is a man and who is a woman in his mind so it's like intuition is fine
(2:17:47) until it's no longer fine then we need to defer to the experts but if you're not going to defer to The Experts then
(2:17:53) intuition is fine it's all [ __ ] these [ __ ] people are a joke they're a joke seriously Shelby says if one
(2:17:59) looks into the crystal its soul is taken by the teoman with her spells okay so
(2:18:05) the crystal stuff is the New Age stuff okay I guess that's fat ass dogs says
(2:18:12) question for first amender if trans are real women then why can't they give
(2:18:18) birth and if being trans is not a mental illness then why is I reject the premise of the question he's say but what about
(2:18:24) some women who can't give birth he's baking into the definition uh uh real
(2:18:29) women right so I don't know exactly what you refer to by real women I I like to look at uh things from an empirical
(2:18:37) standpoint what's a real beer can comp what's a real beer can yeah it's a it can be that can absolutely be a
(2:18:43) complicated question yeah so you can't tell me is this a beer can yes what makes it a real one right
(2:18:51) look at the the typical features what makes that a real beer can well it looks
(2:18:56) like one I mean who what makes it one who's to say that that's not uh where you keep your coins what makes it a real
(2:19:03) beer can I don't I don't know if it had you's everything on planet Earth is this
(2:19:09) way you [ __ ] ad I mean it's kind of the same problem what a [ __ ] idiot dud just stop you're you're the most
(2:19:15) embarrassing debat who's ever been on MDD the most embarrassing debat doing
(2:19:21) great man I mean I feel like I TR is that a real beer can like a bunch is that a real beer can is it real is that
(2:19:27) a real beer can comparison you another one fat ass dogs also asked
(2:19:34) they said and if being trans is not a mental illness then why is the suicide
(2:19:40) rate super high in the trans Community because it's stigma here we go
(2:19:46) ready it's yeah it's usually because of uh people who degrade them and derision is pretty is pretty uh negative
(2:19:54) people I have I have I have numerous studies that show that that's in fact the case just say stigma bro yeah I know
(2:20:00) you want things to be black and white so it's well that's what you just said it's because of stigma right I just pointed
(2:20:06) out the reality I mean you can get mad at the reality so let me ask you a question I'm in reality and you're not do you agree do you agree then with most
(2:20:13) of the leftists that in modernity uh per capita there's as many trans as there
(2:20:19) was in like the 19 19 20s and 1930s because it's just part of brain chemistry
(2:20:24) right it's kind of weird your question um per cap did people that have these
(2:20:33) differences at a neurobiological level yes per capita we have a definition
(2:20:38) naming convention I'm asking understand what it was I'm just asking you per capita by whatever criteria you consider
(2:20:45) a trans to be were there just as many per capita likely in the 20s 30s and 40s as there are right complex question I'm
(2:20:52) sorry I I wish I could give you an easy an easy answer but it's not an easy
(2:20:57) answer it's complex like if you're if you're operating it at a neurological
(2:21:03) level then yes indeed there would be these genetic differences then how come kids in that same age bracket were
(2:21:09) killing themselves less than they are now can you just pause for a second yeah how come they were killing themselves way less when there was way more stigma
(2:21:16) more stigma in the existing in the 1920s anyway I thought I thought just as many
(2:21:22) existed well I I was pointing out the neurochemical level right so if the neurochemical level they exist and they
(2:21:28) were more discriminated against why did they kill themselves less why are you keep repeating the same question because
(2:21:33) you don't ever answer questions because I answer the question it's just never answer questions usually people who are
(2:21:39) a little who who are a little lower in the in their cognitive faculties require
(2:21:45) simpler answers it just clicked for for me first amender that I think he's saying like if you say that
(2:21:51) the same proportion or percentage let's say back in the 1930s then wouldn't it be the case that
(2:21:58) you'd have also a great rep suicide but yet don't and there was 10
(2:22:04) times more stigma than there is now defin now right so defining this was the
(2:22:10) worst thing we could do so defining this was the worst thing we could do I just I didn't hear first am answer first am
(2:22:16) first Amer are you not hearing me is I didn't hear your answer what was it you said that the reason that there wasn't
(2:22:22) suicide back then among children compared to as much as there is today which is a lot more was what what was
(2:22:28) the reason likely social stigma there's social stigmatization that there was more social stigma towards lady boys in
(2:22:35) the 20s son and so why weren't they killing themselves more answer well wait I don't
(2:22:43) know Andrew I don't know stigmatization I've already explained it wait wait you're so you're saying there was no
(2:22:49) Stigma back then first amender you're saying like there was no Stigma so they weren't killing themselves well they they didn't have an accurate definition
(2:22:56) for it and so so then the wor H now that I think about it like now that I think
(2:23:01) about it they probably would have just called it something different like lady boys and they probably would stigmatized
(2:23:08) and they likely would have may some of them may have actually ended up killing themselves all the AR the I'm going to
(2:23:16) say that there's the same amount yes well okay well let me Enlighten you to help you out right so going back to the
(2:23:22) 20s yeah were there drag queens sure did they kill themselves at the same rate that trans do now per capita not at all
(2:23:30) and we do stop we stop we do have act stop bro stop shut up we do actually have
(2:23:37) classifications for this yes we have classifications for those who consider themselves to be drag in the year 1950
(2:23:43) to now they killed themselves at a far less rate your argument here just so you
(2:23:49) know the entailment of it is that by defining it and by putting it out in the ethos we actually did a great Injustice
(2:23:56) because we created the stigma which then led to all these people killing themselves you do therefore we should
(2:24:03) hide it it instead of just like stop people from being bullies but okay yeah that would be the conclusion wouldn't it
(2:24:09) what would be what would be the alternative conclusion to that wait if people kill less mean to if
(2:24:16) people kill themselves less if you bully them than if they kill them if you do not bully them should you not bully them
(2:24:23) I mean I think if you bully anybody my question listen to the words
(2:24:29) can we go the next question if you were no shut up if you were to bully people you were to bully people well we
(2:24:37) do want move forward if you have a really question Andrew then we got very quick very quick listen to my actual
(2:24:43) words if it were the case that if you bullied people and it saved their lives more than it didn't should you bully
(2:24:49) people repeat I'm sorry I I didn't understand if you bullied people and it saved their
(2:24:55) lives more than not bullying people should you bully people I I'm not aware of any instance
(2:25:02) where not my question answer my question uh under your hypothetical I
(2:25:07) suppose so but it's not reality great and that's exactly what we got now dummy but that's not reality it is real
(2:25:14) people get bullied excessively they the entire entailment of your argument was that because we
(2:25:23) AR when they're excessively bullied yes that is in fact the case don't bully people wow that's so to get this so to
(2:25:30) get this right even though there was more stigmatization there was more stigmatization towards them than there
(2:25:35) is now they killed themselves less it seems that the entailment of this argument then would be what the
(2:25:42) entailment of the argument would be that for you to Define it and draw attention to it actually led to more deaths of
(2:25:49) these people than by never acknowledging it and thus bullying them you [ __ ]
(2:25:55) [ __ ] we'll go to the next one orang says that's a what she wearing argument I
(2:26:01) love it there orange chaos says you don't even know what she is how do you know what she's wearing well no I'm
(2:26:07) saying like if she was wearing skimpy outfit did she deserve to be um I'm sorry I don't know if that's okay to say
(2:26:13) in uh but the point is is that is that you you don't you don't you don't create
(2:26:18) the uh stigmatization to wear l or create the stigmatization towards the offender
(2:26:26) right and so the offender here is uh people like you that want to just degrade I guess people's own experience
(2:26:33) well let me let me ask you just a very brief question I know you won't answer it but I'm going to ask anyway I don't want more questions would you would
(2:26:40) you I do want to we quick J it'll take me one second shut up shut up very
(2:26:47) Qui very quickly would you advise your daughter a million questions from the audience to wear less or wear more
(2:26:53) around a group of men wear less or wear more he's belligerent would you I have
(2:26:58) to do this we have so many questions for the audience and last time we said like one more question and we gave you that
(2:27:04) so orange chaos says amender looks like a woman to me so he must according to his own logic be one because that was
(2:27:12) his own argument I mean if I was trans then yeah sure this one from Twilight hay says I'm
(2:27:19) a trans Woman and even I know that I'm not a biological female
(2:27:26) tral is there any way does it contradict your argument though nope not at all
(2:27:32) gender is different from sex I've said that from the beginning neotraditional news say how does that room smell God it's
(2:27:39) got you mean with flavored aromatic tobacco how does your how does how does
(2:27:45) the soy in pachuli in your room smell I think you have soy bro come on I got
(2:27:52) water come on don't lie is it filled with soy is it filled with soy neotraditional noose says can a man can
(2:27:59) a trans man be a trans woman um no no those are distinct things
(2:28:08) really why this one from you guys certainly have chemistry this one from well of jixie says amender
(2:28:17) you should read how to AR okay Dirty Mike says first amender if two guys observe a person and one guy says they
(2:28:23) are looking at a woman and the other guy says no they're looking at a man how can
(2:28:28) we determine who's right I I would just ask
(2:28:34) them gotcha what makes them right what makes them right it's it's again it's a
(2:28:39) complicated question that can be based on very specific experiences and I'm
(2:28:44) perfectly okay with that that doesn't bother but what makes him right though I I don't get all I don't get all triggered when
(2:28:50) questions not answer what makes them right like wait are you let me let me see if you got if you got genitals let
(2:28:55) me see what makes them right reproduce like some weird yeah but what makes them
(2:29:01) right though but what makes them right we've already explained it we
(2:29:06) don't need more questions no we haven't explained it what makes them right can we move to the next I I genuinely I do have to get back to work I have to go
(2:29:11) you don't have to do [ __ ] the most amount of people you ever have in your pathetic [ __ ] life
(2:29:17) watching the question says swampy Pub says chat may have
(2:29:24) potentially given me let's see uh cancer tonight uh thanks for your support swampy pbes Pamela Hast says First
(2:29:30) Amendment though I disagree you are brave for doing this debate solidarity from a fellow okay this one from Saul
(2:29:37) Jones says this they said you're brave for doing this debate Saul Jones says this question is for the knucklehead
(2:29:43) that Andrew uh is debating it's a term of endearment they say if you did not eat breakfast today
(2:29:50) say how would you feel in one word hungry okay good there you go
(2:29:57) excellent thank you but typically I don't I don't eat breakfast just
(2:30:03) FY I typically don't I mean fair enough fair enough will Stewart 365 says why is
(2:30:09) asking for a syllogism quote explaining unquote something to you that's
(2:30:15) literally how how argumentation is done you made the claim you must clarify
(2:30:20) feel like you did clarify because that was actually pretty early in the yes I did exactly that man of Reason says some
(2:30:26) humans have mental problems and most of us want to help by being nice but excuse
(2:30:31) me nice is not the way in helping people say no more often
(2:30:39) thoughts well I usually what I would do you're talking about things that possess a it can be a psychological distinction
(2:30:47) or it can be a chemical issue or a chemical difference in the brain that can cause a great deal
(2:30:52) of suicide ideation from uh from for example puberty and I would want to go
(2:30:58) with what is the medically efficacious uh design and currently the way that we
(2:31:03) do it is uh you take them to a psychologist they analyze whether or not that they have gender dysphoria most of
(2:31:09) them don't have gender dysphoria they basically just socially transition there they usually grow out of it this is
(2:31:15) about 90% of them that grow out of it uh for the ones that do and let's say for example that they do have gender
(2:31:21) dysphoria then they basically would have hormone blockers until that they are 18 once they are 18 they can decide whether
(2:31:27) or not that they want to go through uh hormone replacement therapy which is the replacement of the hormone generally
(2:31:33) they don't expect um surgeries with the exception of momies but momies are even
(2:31:39) accepted even among uh uh teenagers because there are uh girls that grow too
(2:31:44) large breasts this one coming in from appreciate it lost Ronin says first
(2:31:50) amender is displaying exactly why Trump won in a landslide one question if a tree falls in the woods and no one or no
(2:31:58) thing is around to hear it does it still make a sound yes yes J Dallas says first
(2:32:04) amender following your logic if a black man looks like a drug dealer he must be a criminal should I start treating him
(2:32:11) like a criminal and call five 5 call the 5 call the police yeah
(2:32:19) as if knew what that meant okay go ahead uh first amender I mean I reject the
(2:32:25) premise of the question mostly because I just have different views on the drug war it's just I I would rather be in
(2:32:32) favor of rehabilitative measures as opposed to but I mean if I were to say I guess work within your hypothetical
(2:32:39) assuming that I got if I believed in that retributive
(2:32:44) Justice uh I I don't know I don't know it's a complex question not sure I'm sorry I'm
(2:32:51) sorry I wish better question first amender says they say first amender how is your argument not emotionals
(2:32:57) subjective versus being objective and logical when the closing is quote I
(2:33:02) don't want to be a jerk well because at a neurochemical level this uh causes
(2:33:08) gender in congruences so we know that it does exist at an empirical level however
(2:33:13) there are also sociological bases to consider this one from ra dog says if
(2:33:19) it's against my morals to lie and affects me why should I lie to call someone what they are not because of
(2:33:24) their feelings you're predicating the concept that you are lying however you could
(2:33:30) just be mistaken and let's be honest at every single day that you walk around you basically look at people and
(2:33:36) determine their gender instantaneously this one from Airborne animal says trans women are women then
(2:33:43) there should not be any concern about having them in women's prisons along with real women right oh okay yeah so
(2:33:50) what do you think if there's a women's prison and let's say Andrew shaves his beard tomorrow and murders someone and
(2:33:57) says he's a woman uh like are you you GNA put this a very very good question
(2:34:04) uh I'm of the is so complex he can't answer it ladies and gentlemen watch I'm of the belief of uh the the the causing
(2:34:11) the least amount of harm possible right so obviously this would be operated on a
(2:34:17) caseby casee basis basically whatever would cause the least amount of sexual
(2:34:22) abuse would be where they go where's that it it depends it's a
(2:34:28) case by case Bas would you put them in female prisons well take for example if a person is in fact put them in female
(2:34:35) trans female they probably and it's like heavily trans female like everything about them is very female and let's say
(2:34:42) that they got you put them in female pronon yes because they're females made by Jim
(2:34:50) Bob says first amender can a biological female be a transwoman if no explain why
(2:34:55) not can a biological female no because they're just they're just uh right from
(2:35:00) the GetGo are they females you can't transition to female you're already
(2:35:07) female wait trans women or trans men are females I've already explained it you
(2:35:13) don't think trans women are females we're gonna be here all day jams I'm sorry can we continue for Jess Gerald
(2:35:19) says amender what color Crystal do you want to be in this one from Rachel Wilson says first amender
(2:35:27) dismisses all respect to biological females who are deeply offended by creepers in dresses who want to be
(2:35:32) called women for sexual gratification somebody register this so they're
(2:35:38) basically you're saying hey you know some guys get their jollies they just get off to this putting on address and
(2:35:44) they're saying do you acknowledge that's a real thing I'm not going to yuck anybody's Young as long as you're not
(2:35:50) hurting anybody you do you that doesn't bother me let me uh they say you're dismissing
(2:35:58) all respect to biological females who are dly offended by creepers and dresses who want to be called women for sexual gratification I think that Rachel's
(2:36:04) saying like hey if some guy is just doing it to get his rocks off and you're G to say like okay he's a woman like
(2:36:11) Rachel's saying like man this is kind of like an insult to us women like we don't want that to count as a member of our
(2:36:17) class our category okay I mean like at the end of the day
(2:36:23) uh a person like that could actually end up uh in prison due to a sexual offense
(2:36:28) if that's all that's happening uh again like if there is a victim then obviously
(2:36:35) that's that's an issue but this doesn't really remove the validity of of trans people
(2:36:41) unfortunately literally that's an non he just didn't even answer anything I did answer it we did Saul Jones says how
(2:36:46) many Homo sapiens sapiens does it to screw a light
(2:36:51) bulb we don't have any time too we don't have any we don't have any time for any
(2:36:57) more additional questions let me just see if there are any that I didn't cover that were serious questions ah take a few more James make some money right
(2:37:02) take make some money Saul Jones we got one for you Andrew they say can you please quit trying to steal all our
(2:37:09) girlfriends with that sexy new pipe you keep smoking wow it is a really sexy pipe I agree with that uh but no I will
(2:37:16) not be stealing anybody's girlfriend uh that's for sure I'm happily married and they don't want me anyway so don't feel
(2:37:22) bad about it I wonder why because I'm old and ugly they don't
(2:37:28) want you because you're young and gay how old do you think I
(2:37:34) am uh I would say probably uh late 20s early 30s I'm
(2:37:40) 35 okay 35 how did how did you not get two testicles in 35 years bro I I feel
(2:37:48) like I have testicles but I mean I don't think you want do you want a picture of my testicles that's kind of odd nobody asked for a picture
(2:37:54) of your testicles well talk seem to be really interested in my general you seem to be really interested in sending me
(2:37:59) pictures of your testicle which reaffirms the fact that you're gay you're going to pay me I'm pansexual if if you wanted to
(2:38:07) know of course you are yeah of course I don't know what that means real nobody knows what the [ __ ] that means it it
(2:38:13) just means bisexual but very uh oh so you do [ __ ] men no no not not it's don't
(2:38:19) have to answer that it's really okay this real online Phil says Andrew W bro
(2:38:25) asks Andrew for conventional method of sex verification not an infallible one
(2:38:31) then falsely frames Andrew's answer as an infallible one do you feel like this is true first offender that is correct
(2:38:38) no I don't I don't feel that that's true at all nobody cares what you feel that's what happened this one VOR says this guy
(2:38:45) needs to be sent straight to the crystals wait is this something bad is does this mean something no no no no no
(2:38:51) it's an old meme um you know how Trump had the crystals he was like I'm playing with my crystals or something like that
(2:38:57) he put out the tweet and so what conservatives have been doing is they've been saying uh we're going to put the
(2:39:02) Liberals in the crystals and the method behind this behind saying this is uh
(2:39:08) they take offense to it they don't know why and conservatives aren't actually making a threat but it makes liberals
(2:39:14) feel like they are for no good reason that's the joke maybe spend less time on fortun and more on reading actual
(2:39:20) academic textbooks oh lord well then we can end up like you and never answer a question can't
(2:39:26) write based argument and I did give you a syllogism and it wasil it was it was an unsound argument
(2:39:34) you're an idiot yeah you came at unequivocal F you know what you should do you should contact I'm going to help you out with this you're not going to
(2:39:40) take my advice contact a guy name ask yourself so that you can learn how to actually make proper arguments it's
(2:39:46) really sad bro okay this one from eror Nick says first amer's entire position
(2:39:51) is an argument ad populum because he's already admitted he identifies people's man/woman classification based on his
(2:39:59) subjective definition of respect no based on his own metric I
(2:40:05) actually asked him his metric that's why I I asked the argument as to how you determine someone to be a woman so I
(2:40:11) used his metric against himself he tacitly basically came to the conclusion
(2:40:17) that trans women are women I didn't even have to it's very obvious it's a the
(2:40:23) opposite actually is what happened so when you ask me my personal you say how
(2:40:28) would you determine X things same thing with the cat and the dog you you can instantly say from my own subjective
(2:40:34) metric how else could you judge a thing just off of your eyeballs right but the criteria here is still for what a female
(2:40:41) is what is a female well here's my definition of what a female is never asked me how we would scientifically
(2:40:47) determine it only that the criteria needed to exist that they were indeed females that was the thing which was
(2:40:54) never in dispute and he just did a kind of a normal bait and switch a leftist bait and switch where he said okay uh
(2:41:01) but because you agree with me that sometimes you can be tricked somehow that means they're actual females it's
(2:41:07) [ __ ] bizarre makes no sense and that's why the syllogism worked against him this in PR do appreciate it Airborne
(2:41:14) animal says by first amender logic since he looks like a muppet and I believe he is a muppet I.E an empty fuzzy hand
(2:41:21) Muppet or puppet he is such one they're saying according to your logic this is
(2:41:27) true Muppets aren't humans they're not the same thing right I'm talking about Homo
(2:41:34) sapiens sapiens wait I'm sorry is there a taxonomical classification for what is a muppet uh yeah there there isn't it's
(2:41:41) not a it's not a it's not a creature it's just some plastic so then why why I
(2:41:46) don't understand why couldn't a person identify as being a muppet if their brain wave said because you're not pieces of plastic like I don't know what
(2:41:52) to yeah but all they have to do is identify as being a mother is there wood involved I anyway this one coming in
(2:41:59) from J why couldn't you make a muppet out of human skin can we just like you
(2:42:04) because I I genuinely I do have to work in the morning oh my God you're such a [ __ ] dude stop being such a [ __ ] how
(2:42:10) about this last one name if sex and gender are the same why
(2:42:17) is reassignment of sexual organs part of it I'm sorry repeat it they're saying if
(2:42:25) sex and gender are not the same why is reassignment of sexual organs part of
(2:42:31) this process of transitioning well because you're talking about the changing of phenotypic
(2:42:39) characteristics whereas gender doesn't necessarily have to be predicated on
(2:42:44) phenotypic characteristics but be can be entirely sociological that's
(2:42:50) okay so not
(2:42:56) real this one let's see oh the most most of these seem like they're about
(2:43:01) crystals but do want to say folks we got to let first amender out of here want to say thank you for being here folks it's
(2:43:07) been a true pleasure it's been a Rowdy debate don't forget to hit that subscribe button we have many more debates coming up and if you haven't yet
(2:43:14) hit that like button on the way out we also still have that poll up in the modern day debate live chat here here on
(2:43:19) YouTube in terms of which arguments you found most persuasive and who's
(2:43:26) winning Mick B let me do this for if I can do this for Mick B um they say polite reminder
(2:43:34) we're all here because of a transwoman Lynn Conway who invented the vsi chips
(2:43:39) that make modern Computing
(2:43:45) possible with that we'll let you guys go are you guys in you guys uh Andrew I think you're in Eastern Time right
(2:43:51) because you're in Michigan yeah I don't care though uh I was I listen when when
(2:43:56) my job if if I agree to a debate my job is to make your channel money my job is
(2:44:03) to make sure I show up and give it the best accounting of myself that I possibly can representation of my
(2:44:08) worldview I'm not going to leave till the debate is done so but I do I do have to ask you this James who's winning
(2:44:14) who's winning the poll who's winning well the poll's not done yet but I will
(2:44:19) say that is of now Andrew has 80% first amender has 10% I'm not sure has 5% and I don't care
(2:44:28) I'm a self-hating soy boy has 4 per. so he's running neck and neck with
(2:44:34) I don't care all right we wait let me do made by Jim PO let me
(2:44:42) do I mean obviously you have a larger audience I don't understand that though I thought I was wildly unpopular would
(2:44:48) you like like me to read your messages there person matter you do this a what that means is it's not wildly unpopular
(2:44:55) is that a lot of people don't like you but that's Oh you mean a lot of leftists like Destiny and Bosch don't like me the
(2:45:00) circles you run in I'm just saying that there's a do you realize that I'm one of the largest right-wing creators on planet Earth you dope that's
(2:45:08) great hated I was I was disliked you idiot idiot this from by by who by
(2:45:15) leftist you think right wi you think right Wingers love you or what made by Jim Bob right yeah I mean hopefully I
(2:45:22) get as much people that dislike me as you made by Jim Bob says first amender as an empirical person do you have any
(2:45:27) empirical evidence that rights exist uh any empirical evidence that
(2:45:34) rights exist right I mean well rights are socially constructed I mean if you mean
(2:45:39) like physically on a piece of paper yeah but like like the actual rights
(2:45:45) themselves I mean that's just a social construction but again that doesn't mean that it doesn't do rights exist or
(2:45:52) not it it's a complicated question again everything is so complex you can't answer it's complex hold on one second
(2:45:59) this one uh first amender let me make it up to you I just I if if it's okay with you to read a few more is that people
(2:46:05) are going to get pissed at me if they're like yeah no I got all right I'll shut up I'll shut up James goad Benji says
(2:46:10) question for first amender why does politeness or kindness towards an individual ultimately determine if your
(2:46:16) logical syllogism is valid or invalid uh that was not required my syllogism
(2:46:23) had said nothing regarding kindness all I needed is to prove even a subset of
(2:46:28) trans people are in fact women and he agreed with
(2:46:33) that you got it let me just SK in case there's
(2:46:39) a Christopher Scott says first amender is the most let's see okay so some of these are
(2:46:46) just flagrant insults like they not trying to ask a question wrongful rage
(2:46:51) says Andrew W take the L and get in the crystal okay don't worry I'll I'll get
(2:46:59) the crystal get in the crystal I'll give Andrew the heart he gets a heart right
(2:47:04) that's sweet all right Nick says if transwoman if a if a transwoman who
(2:47:10) still had sperm and a penis and they would only engage in
(2:47:16) consensual relations should they be allowed into a woman's prison where they might impregnate other
(2:47:22) prisoners yeah again I would want the area of the least amount of harm right
(2:47:28) because there's aspects to consider there's uh the safety of other prisoners and the safety of themselves there can
(2:47:35) be for example somebody who passes really really well as a female and they really just have no business being in a
(2:47:41) man's prison right so again I just look at the least amount of harm but of course if this person is going to jail
(2:47:48) for say you know sexually abusing uh women even if they look like a woman they need to go in the Men's prison
(2:47:54) right it's it's a case by case basis even if they are females the argument is just least harm possible yeah but even
(2:48:00) if they are females would you send them to a least harm possible that's what I would argue yeah but that but that's
(2:48:06) going to be subjective so I have to ask you your met that's fine that's how that's how that works it's okay yeah I
(2:48:12) know so I have to ask you your opinion because it's your metric I I gave you the metric yeah I know so if so I just
(2:48:18) want to clarification on this one thing so would you send in this scenario
(2:48:25) females to male prisons in some situations that may be necessary yes
(2:48:32) okay is anyone else having someone actually asked this in chat and I thought I was like H I don't know they
(2:48:39) said is anyone ever since the election having difficulty on YouTube where you have to like refresh the page several
(2:48:46) times I've had that tonight like great that is uh that is YouTube is rolling
(2:48:52) out a bunch of new encoding software is my understanding and they did put out a
(2:48:57) memo saying that there was going to be some refresh slowdowns and things like this until they caught up oh I didn't
(2:49:03) even know but yeah it's so slow did either of you guys okay next
(2:49:09) question let me just reload this and hopefully this reloads either of you guys noticed that the YouTube logo color
(2:49:14) is slightly different red like in the last several months is it like your Shir shirt right no now it's it's a little
(2:49:21) bit lighter than my shirt it's like uh just a it's supposed to be a little bit more like inv
(2:49:28) something this one from Jess Gerald says please say quote get him in the crystal
(2:49:34) followed by trollol for the chat we'd appreciate it
(2:49:39) immensely get him in the crystal trollol I don't know what this means this one from wrongful R is Andrew we got that
(2:49:46) one mkb says PL reminder that we're all here because of a transom Lyn con what I yeah
(2:49:54) I already read that um folks sometimes you guys some of you like you didn't read my Super Chat I'm like I did it was
(2:50:00) like 20 minutes ago uh but thank you mkb for submitting it I just uh Austin
(2:50:06) Graham says if an albino African thinks they are Caucasian are
(2:50:12) they if somebody thinks they're Caucasian yeah uh in particular the
(2:50:17) problem is is that 's a there's a gen behind it so you know however it is
(2:50:24) similar in the sense of different phenotypic characteristics where it somebody could interpret that they are
(2:50:30) uh white or whatever yeah this one coming in from seriously
(2:50:35) Shelby says if you want to learn how to debate go to debate University learn how to debate from the best I appreciate
(2:50:43) that you it would do you well it's 500 bucks for the course I would get it if I were you
(2:50:49) this one let me just see if there's anything uh trying to I'm looking for the serious
(2:50:56) ones I'm cutting out all the crystal all the crystals and the Muppet
(2:51:02) and all the stuff like that but those are really funny oh first
(2:51:07) amender do you have to wake up early are you oh no no I don't think I'm buying that I mean you should you might learn
(2:51:14) how to actually argue I'm good man appreciate it though Nick says if a schizophrenic person has a personality
(2:51:20) that identifies as a woman and their other personality identifies as a man which one is right first amender I don't
(2:51:26) know needs a psychologist that's complicated everything is so complicated
(2:51:32) that we can never answer in fact a beer can knowing if a beer a beer can is real
(2:51:38) is so complicated he couldn't there's a lot to it yeah there's a lot to it it's too much oh wait David Muller says he
(2:51:45) that I missed his let me just check they said if I'm going to identify as a woman right now and will'll say that our
(2:51:51) Skittle our Skittle Community is laughing at you as
(2:51:57) well see I'm going to identify as a woman right now and will say that our Skittle Community what is the skittle
(2:52:04) community that would be gays really yeah oh I see is that uh Taste the
(2:52:10) rainbow I see they're so they're saying if I'm going to identify as a woman and
(2:52:15) say that our so that okay I think that they're
(2:52:22) saying if they identify as a woman you would would you go along with it even
(2:52:28) like you wouldn't you wouldn't buy that would you first amender I'm Sorry by
(2:52:36) what you wouldn't Grant that's true but let me just uh I'm Gonna Let You Go in
(2:52:42) just a sec I feel so bad I'm sorry you're not are you on the East Coast West Coast uh East Coast it is uh 10:56
(2:52:49) currently I usually go to bed at around 11:00 I plan on sticking up even a little later just to kind of uh you know
(2:52:58) just go back to my home station where people are likely cheering me on I hope
(2:53:03) this one from okay I'll try to wrap up fast here it's Austin Graham we got that one blessed flip says wouldn't this be
(2:53:11) semantic argument determine means quote to ascertain exactly you can't determine
(2:53:16) someone's sex by sight you can only assume yeah it's like seemed like there
(2:53:22) was like a correct this person is understanding
(2:53:27) uh how some how a trans that's a knock against you bro not against me I don't I don't know why you don't
(2:53:34) get that that's actually a knock against you okay this one gzilla 37 they say
(2:53:42) theoretically if you had a daughter amender would you want your daughter to wear more or less clothing around
(2:53:49) men I think they are saying you want to dress I personally would not want my
(2:53:54) daughter wearing skimpy clothing when they're a child it just seems inappropriate to me
(2:54:00) but consider if if she was 18 she could do whatever she wants yeah I know but what would you prefer if she was 18 I
(2:54:08) again I would want her to be happy whatever her what would make her more or less safe is his question that's his
(2:54:14) question her being happy and I'd get her some bare mace if she's gonna tress SK so she can dress so you would say dress
(2:54:21) like a [ __ ] and have some be maze perfect perfectly okay yes okay perfectly okay with that yes and
(2:54:28) I'm guessing you have zero children right huh I mean I've I don't have children but I care of uh my my many
(2:54:35) younger brothers for years and you know it you know I mean they've grown up
(2:54:41) quite well I mean doing great this one coming in from oh they
(2:54:47) had asked first amender would you date a transwoman and would
(2:54:53) you have relations with a transwoman sure why not post or pre op it doesn't matter you
(2:55:01) don't care no so so I just want to make sure I get this right and on record you would suck your girlfriend's dick sure
(2:55:09) why not this one from Nick that's a Nick
(2:55:14) says if a trans woman who still had sperm got that one let me I thought I
(2:55:19) had a new one blessed flip says wouldn't this I think we we're all cut up that's all I see but I want to say folks thank
(2:55:25) you for being here it's been a true pleasure to have you we'll end on that note uh let's
(2:55:30) see G just qug says I missed it let me check and Twig I'm assuming that yours
(2:55:36) is is not an insult he said it truly seems that first amendment is just more educated woo why does Andrew seem to
(2:55:44) ignore this to favor his own belief oh you got me I mean the the idiot couldn't
(2:55:49) make a syllogism that when applied to his same logic didn't in fact he even
(2:55:55) caught himself he was like oh [ __ ] now I see what you're saying I made an I I made a valid argument un sound right uh
(2:56:02) and and this was the case of the entire debate the guy doesn't even understand basic logic it's sad uh but on top of
(2:56:07) that all he did was make category errors and fallacious arguments but that's okay because one day he'll be sucking his
(2:56:13) girlfriend's penis and you know what I don't know what to say about that I'm just going to let him do it
(2:56:19) it's okay Andrew you could do whatever you want too all the love coming your way will you will will you at least at
(2:56:26) least say on camera that if you are sucking your girlfriend's penis you'll at least grab the balls a little would
(2:56:32) you grab the balls if if you really lik she really like if they liked it sure yeah yeah of course you're gonna grab the balls of course why not yeah of
(2:56:39) course I mean you got to do that we'll jump into this next one want to say thank you very much

(3:06:43) Crucible and instead we don't want any [ __ ] talk we are like hey we are grateful for our
(3:06:50) Debaters including Andrew and grudges are for they're they're just kind of like
(3:06:57) who wants to be uh real men just don't hold grudges it's just like some weird emotional thing you know like it's not
(3:07:04) to hold a grudge is like a gringy a feminite thing that it's like

(3:08:44) channel I don't know what you mean you're saying that Andrew or first amender are playing video games on their
(3:08:50) Channel I don't is that what you're saying I play video games once in a while I do play uh I I play them when
(3:08:57) they're like 10 years old or five years old at least because I'm very frugal if
(3:09:03) a game is like $5 or 10 maybe $10 it's a really good game I'll spring for it okay
(3:09:09) but otherwise I'm very frugal I just wait until it's like 5 years old and then there's like a you know a digital
(3:09:15) sale so but yeah you are right shellshock says use streamlabs streamlabs takes only 5% games I should
(3:09:21) do that we used to use streamlabs it occasionally it would just like shut down on me
(3:09:27) randomly um I don't know why but I think you're right I could probably do it it's
(3:09:32) probably it's probably that we now I've got a better laptop so I think it could work better so um that's a good idea but
