(14:14) America and never in South America so I got a question how are you flying all around
(14:20) to all these by plane yeah yeah hang on okay yeah I assumed it was by plane I didn't think you flapped your arms um so
(14:27) you're flying you're flying around by plan to all these different different countries right why did you need political asylum in the United States
(14:34) why mhm um why do I need political Asylum yeah so I mean if you were flying
(14:40) all over the world doing these like corn shoots and making money I assume doing
(14:45) doing pornography yeah why did you need political Asylum inting one year and something months ago
(14:54) mhm um I quit his scarting it was enough I
(14:59) fly to Jerusalem I went to the wall of cry I spoke to the god and I decided
(15:07) that this is a good time to quit second dicks for money yeah I get that right I
(15:13) understand and then I decided that it's also a great time to move to America yeah right but why just work together
(15:21) why did you need political Asylum though what do you mean what well you said you were asking for Asylum right
(15:27) yeah that's how came to America yeah Asylum from what from Russia yeah for what reason though Putin yeah but what
(15:35) was Putin doing to stop you from flying all around the world and doing pornography oh not this no I was I had a
(15:40) problem why you need Asylum I don't get I had a problem with Russia bro I had a problem by living in Russia okay that
(15:47) was and it's that's because you were doing that activity so like if you went back to Russia my political opposition
(15:53) that's why you're poit oh like being against Putin yep okay so the not because you
(16:00) were doing porn no no they didn't care about that I never did porn in Russia no I know but if you went back to Russia
(16:08) they would care if you did do the porn right polit like officially yeah no no
(16:15) no okay so just purely because you don't like Putin because what I'm saying con line yeah okay about him okay just
(16:23) trying to figure it out for sure for sure let's go we are here for this MH

(17:51) meant how School through school okay longest relationship 11 months and you both are local here uh no he lives back
(17:59) where I oh so it's long distance yeah okay got it what about you I'm chronically single and I've been single
(18:05) for like two years now all right uh longest relationship 9 months and this
() 
(18:13) was a boyfriend yeah okay when you say chronically single what do you mean by that um I literally cannot figure out
(18:21) who I want to date like I'm not very attracted to a lot of people mhm but
(18:26) what do you mean you're not really attracted to a lot of what does that mean like I don't really have a sex drive for most people so if I'm not like
(18:34) physically attracted to you I can't be with you there has to be personality and
(18:39) like physical attraction cuz if there isn't why would that going to be there but what percentage of men would you say
(18:46) you find physically attractive I would say 50 like it's it's a lot but I just
(18:51) haven't found them wait you haven't found 50% of men no no like I haven't found someone who I physically am
(18:58) attracted to but I want to date cuz I don't like their personality oh I see okay so you think 50% of men what that
(19:06) fit whatever those criteria are attractive you you just rule them out based on other criteria than
(19:12) attractiveness cuz I just feel like I don't know I care more about personality rather than like attractiveness but it's
(19:19) still there yeah of course yeah yeah you have to be attracted to a person for sure but I feel like nowadays it's hard
(19:24) to find someone with a good personality that also isn't going to cheat on me i' had I've had enough of
(19:31) that what are some of the things I mean it kind of checks out yeah it kind of does Wait So when you say good
(19:39) personality so that that's actually higher than most women in terms of the
(19:44) percentage of men that you find attractive but what percentage of men do you think have personalities that are
(19:51) sufficiently attractive enough for you to date I mean it sounds like very little right I think it's
(19:57) 20% and that's still very high yeah I mean I'm shooting from like 10 to 20 personality
(20:03) wise yeah okay but they also will all cheat on you or would cheat on you I don't think all of them would but it's
(20:10) just I don't want to take the risk right now I see why do you think they're cheating because of how I haven't been
(20:17) in my past I haven't moved moved forward from it yet it was a horrible situation
(20:22) for me oh like a previous relationship yes okay and so you're bringing that
(20:28) kind hold on one sec one sec hold on I'm sorry guys one sec no
(20:48) problem okay go ahead where are we at I we just asking like um basically so it's
(20:56) kind of the baggage that you're bringing from this last want to bring that into another relationship cuz it's not fair for the other person I see and what are
(21:03) some of the traits that you're looking for in terms of personality I feel like this is really simple it's caring charismatic like I need you to be funny
(21:09) if you don't have humor I can't talk to you because it would just be a boring
(21:14) Bland conversation um someone who's motivated and likes to work um wait
() 
(21:20) let's do these one at a time yeah so you said boring and Bland conversation
(21:26) yeah have you ever considered that perhaps it's you that's the boring one it could be me I don't know it could be
(21:33) both wa so okay you uh you need a charismatic guy what are the other things uh charismatic car I think that's
(21:40) did you say caring yeah okay caring um I like for someone to take care of me as I take care of them so
(21:46) 50/50 um like financially you mean no not financially I don't care about just like the effort in the relationship yeah
(21:52) the effort like I'll cook and clean for you but I need you to be giving me the love that I deserve which is what I
(21:59) don't know 100% of you if I give you 100% I expect it back
(22:04) okay and what are the other personality traits that you're desirous of in the partner I need you to be hilarious so
(22:11) super funny super charismatic um I feel like I don't ask for
(22:16) much like it's like Baseline the audio is muted please yeah what just have to be a
(22:25) comedian who is willing to give you 100% of themselves yeah that's not a lot to
(22:30) ask that's not a lot how what percentage of men do you think are
(22:37) charismatic I have no clue take a GU and the entire world no no no just
(22:44) that you would engage with oh like 20 20% okay you think 20% of men are
(22:53) charismatic yeah of the people that I've met so one in five men is is charismatic
(23:00) yes okay and how how many are hilarious I think like 30 to
(23:07) 40% from this 50% of men you find physically attractive 20% of them are
(23:13) charismatic 30 to 40% are funny I mean statistically it would seem like you would have come across a man who meets
(23:20) yeah they basically fallen out of the sky here I did that went out the window when he
(23:25) went to jail oh here we go okay maybe his funny charismatic personality
(23:31) help him get through there oh no it did not oh H
(23:37) um do you a question for you do you think that you're charismatic I think I am do you think you're hilarious oh I
(23:44) think I'm like mid-tier funny mid tier funny that's why I need someone else to carry it to carry I thought you wanted
(23:49) 50/50 no I want 100 100 with um showing love I can't give you Charisma no
(23:58) I again I'm talking about the humor I feel like I'm really funny but also if you say you're really funny you're usually not wait how do you define
(24:05) Charisma I have no clue you it's something you very much need but you don't know how to define it yes okay
(24:12) I'll Google it for you just so we're atage tangible yeah compelling attractiveness or Charm that can Inspire
(24:20) devotion in others a divinely conferred power or Talent a personal magic of
(24:26) leadership AR around in special popular loyalty or enthusiasm for a public
(24:32) figure yeah basically just like definition one I think is what what was the first one the
(24:39) compelling yeah I'm not even pleased with some of these definitions to be honest yeah like once once defining
(24:44) charismatics from like a religious standpoint how about this from Wikipedia
(24:50) Charisma is a personal quality of presence or Charm that other people find psychologically compelling I think
(24:56) that's perhaps the best one yeah so it's different for everyone well I mean it would have to be psychologically compelling right that's what your that's
(25:03) what your whole thing is yeah I also need someone intelligent and intelligent and intelligent like you don't need to
(25:09) be topof theine smart but I need you to be able to have a conversation with me on things that I enjoy and that you
(25:16) enjoy but something that's like psychology talk to me about psychology you could talk to me about any [ __ ]

(29:24) they're not sending their best they're bringing bad tattoos they're bringing boltons they're prostitutes and some I
(29:32) assume are good people and they're coming in illegally like and then applying for
(29:38) Asylum when they get here no I apply On the Border yeah that's when you got here
(29:43) this is only one way which side of the Border sorry which side of the Border I Texas La yeah so you were in so you got
(29:50) you got into the United States illegally yeah exactly yeah so what what did I say that was wrong you say and you ask here
(29:57) for political you did ask here I'm sorry did you know that Texas is part of the United States o bro come on don't
(30:04) confuse me I'm not confusing you you you went to Texas right yeah you're absolutely right they're just trying to
(30:11) make little bit different because you're like I arrived here offic unofficially and then you asked for political asy did
(30:17) you came in il and then you asked for political there is only one way to ask for political Asylum you have to be
(30:23) illegally On the Border this is only one way no that is not the only way you can do it you could do tons of channels to
(30:29) ask for political Asylum no yes only on the border now you can fly in and ask for political Asylum no you can change
(30:36) the status but you can't to CH no my daughter fly here without with normal visa and I can't to put her inside my
(30:44) case to ask for political Asylum you understand there no no no It's Tricky
(30:49) you definitely can't fly in and just say I want yeah but how's that not working the system that's literally playing the
(30:54) system if I have a Visa and I come here with Visa I can't to ask for political Asylum because it means I'm changing my
(30:59) status it means that I lied before you understand if I arrived here with a get
(31:05) I get it but you're still playing the system I playing the most easy way let's say like that I took the most fast cut
(31:15) back all right we have another chat here Sons of Liberty Democrats are like Putin
(31:22) imprison political opponents censor political speech calling it hate speech meta attempting to delete political
(31:28) opponents democracy or access to abortions Trump 2024 all right Sons of Liberty thank you
(31:34) for the message we'll do it really quick um would you rather have democracy or access to
(31:40) abortions I don't care you got to pick
(31:49) one what is democracy like in America being able to vote I don't care I never
(31:54) vote I have to pick one mhm
(32:01) abortion all right what about you I'd say democracy because then you can change the law no well so in this
(32:08) question I think it it kind of presupposes that if you do get if you do
(32:13) get the Democracy there will not be abortion there can't be if you get abortion there won't be democracy right
(32:19) I still choose democracy okay I'm choosing abortion democracy abortion abortion
(32:26) definitely democracy I'm very against abortion I've seen videos of them and they're horrific I'll never support that
(32:32) Jake neither but if I had to democracy abortion that's a lie it's not a lie I
(32:42) don't want you people to reproduce oh every podcast you say otherwise that's
(32:47) you do realize that that's a joke it's a joke I know are you sure that's why are
(32:52) you sure maybe it is your problem that you're not hilarious enough you know well it wasn't a joke I was being honest
(32:58) yeah no uh I don't know democracy potentially could be worse could be worse I'm on the fence on
(33:04) that actually democracy actually could be worse than abortion ultimately so I think it
(33:10) was abortion abortion abortion abortion you4 okay that's interesting well you
(33:16) know what we'll save the abortion conversation for later I guess um all right let's get into the pre-show
(33:23) notes then so starting with let's see see here Lily you were on the Charlie
(33:31) Kirk 25 liberal college students versus Charlie Kirk you had about 30
(33:37) seconds uh we could either pull it up or you can summarize essentially the we can pull it up okay why don't we go ahead
() 
(33:43) and pull it up yeah hang on hang on if I remember correctly right cuz I think I reviewed this and I think I got through
(33:49) uh you when you got voted off and it was just like emotional you're a horrible person was basically what we were saying
(33:55) to Kirk me yeah is that right it was just like a bunch of emotional like you're a really bad person type of thing
(34:03) no wasn't that wasn't you I think I was one of the most s like calm I had one of
(34:09) the most calm responses from my knowledge Maybe I'm Wrong yeah I think I was too passive actually are you
(34:15) speaking about the one who um said yeah you're thinking of a different girl I think I know who I know you're though
(34:22) somebody else do we have it what is it uh it's is that the really big big
(34:27) chick who was doing that Charlie Kirk thing she went up a few times as well yeah yeah and she said Charlie K
(34:34) she like she was going to break the chair yeah I thought we said no personal attacks that's like crazy thing to say I
(34:39) personally attack you is this scene where everyone that like runs in like
(34:44) well she wasn't exactly running let's be real maybe we're talking about someone different here she was I'm talking about
(34:49) this one is that not the one yeah that's that's the one Andrew's probably thinking of okay yeah maybe um let's go
(34:56) ahead and play it oh wait wait wait wait wait stop stop stop stop stop stop video tab please this kid as well in Jubilee wait it what
(35:05) they all right okay just give us a recap then yeah um basically yeah you have you
(35:11) have red flags um they say 32 one you run to a chair whoever gets there first gets to debate Charlie on a prompt that
(35:17) was given um I went up on the one that said um abortion is murder and should be illegal um because I don't think it
(35:23) should be illegal and um I froze it was the first time I've done a political debate let alone live on camera and um I
(35:31) also didn't know who Charlie Kirk was I went up there thinking this was a man whose mind I could change and I was like Hey com hi I'm from Ohio like you know
(35:37) I'm Sor Republicans I'm like I get you like I know where you're coming from um
(35:42) and I basically I mean I said what about in The Stance or in the case where my
(35:48) mother's life is in danger and then he said cesarian section from my perspective first time doing something
(35:54) live a political debate um I Heard cerian and I was like what the hell did
(36:00) this man just say I've never heard the word cerian before in my life partly my fault um cuz like I could have done more
(36:06) research but I also don't think I'm completely uneducated on the topic I'm a woman abortion is an important issue um
(36:13) for me and in this country um but I said I sat there and I said I don't know what
(36:19) that is and I was voted off immediately which valid whatever um yeah
(36:25) H so basically not much to react too in the clip it sounds like yeah not much not much yeah okay um you said you do
(36:33) have two dating stories to share uh your ex-best friend hooked up hooked up with one of your exes and dated three
(36:41) well she hooked up with here let's get split going please I'll let you uh your
(36:47) ex- best friend hooked up with one of your exes and dated two others one of these X's whipped out an AR-15 with no
(36:53) ammo and a bulletproof vest when he heard a noise in the house and got spooked super weird Behavior to
(37:00) watch uh super weird behavior on the the guy who had the AR-15 or the your friend
(37:07) getting freaked out oh my friend wasn't there at the time well it was just these
(37:13) are like two separate things basically oh they're two separate things okay let's start with the first one then okay your ex- best friend hooked up with one
() 
(37:20) of your your exes and dated two others so three yeah
(37:26) she I was dating this one guy it was like my first boyfriend for a year and she was
(37:32) my best friend for like seven years we met in middle school he and I broke up sophomore year or what like high school
(37:38) I don't remember um she made out with him on New Year's we were like best friends like sister like at the hip um
(37:45) and then there was another guy my ex for two years and um this was the one who you
(37:52) know we'll talk about that in a second but um he
(37:58) yeah he and I broke up because we were doing long distance and I got a text from my sister saying she found out from
(38:04) his sister saying that they were dating and they were together for like six months um oh that was these both of
(38:10) these things happened after she also hooked up well started dating another one of my exes from I don't really know if I'd say ex we like talked for several
(38:17) months so were you friends at the time yeah when she was dating your exes all of them during all of them okay yeah yep
(38:24) um okay uh I don't know if it's even really worth
(38:32) going into the whole is it okay for people to date people's
(38:37) exes I don't know if that's a particularly no it's not I don't think that's super interesting uh one of these
(38:43) X's though whipped out an AR-15 with no ammo and a bulletproof vest when he heard a noise in the house and got
(38:49) spooked super weird Behavior to watch so this is one of your ex's yes okay so you
(38:55) were with him in his house yes he had had a firearm did you know he had a firearm I did
(39:00) okay uh the so super weird on his part to have kid it up in my opinion yes
(39:08) especially cuz he didn't have ammo so I mean I'm not pro gun or anything I think
(39:14) if I hear a noise in the house I'm probably going to lock my door and hide or something I don't know or just go
(39:19) investigate like it's your own house it's it was like noon like I don't know I didn't think whatever if he had to Bluff a person would you rather Bluff
(39:26) him with an empty gun what's Bluff Bluff like trick them like Fring trick them oh
(39:31) yeah well like no because if someone's actually I don't know cuz if someone's actually like if somebody kicked in your
(39:37) door like a criminal kicked in your door to get into your house if you could choose a gun with no ammo or nothing
(39:43) wouldn't you prefer to have a gun wouldn't that trick them yeah I guess but I don't know it was just weird to
(39:49) watch so stand a reason then that if he had a rifle he thought that there was a possibility something was wrong even
(39:54) there was no ammo that that would be a great deterrent if somebody saw that he
(40:00) had an AR-15 I guess but he lives like 30 minutes out in the fields like no one was there and also like if anyone was
(40:06) there you know that's where criminals hit most is in rural areas how did you know that because I live in a rural area
(40:13) statistics but yes uh they do they do hit often in rural areas because of police response time it was weird to see
(40:20) yeah what what was weird well because also I think he just felt cool doing it even afterwards he was like yeah what a
(40:25) rush wait so question for you what in this scenario so in the scenario um you would
(40:34) prefer so he had this equipment granted it was a unloaded he had no ammo for the
(40:40) AR-15 he had a bulletproof vest in the scenario where it there was not a
(40:45) determination yet made if killer of cereal donated
(40:51) $200 holy Brian Mason update great debate with angry m feminist Andrew
(40:58) rattlesnake you're a g welcome back Kirk did great on that show panel most
(41:05) embarrassing dayt to caral Story please hey kill of Serial thank you so much man
(41:10) good to see you in the uh in the chat uh Mason he's uh he's still in the hospital we did a fundraiser uh I
(41:18) believe on Tuesday show we were able to do an additional contribution of3
(41:24) $3,400 uh on top of the, 1500 I'd already sent and uh yeah he's still in the hospital uh still recovering I think
(41:31) he had like an emergency surgery yesterday uh I think there was like an infection so um I'll uh try to I think
(41:39) we have all the links posted in our Discord discord.gg whatever think he had a fever or sick and then they found a
(41:45) leak in his colon then he had a surgery an emergency surgery I'll ask this one later kill of Serial so thank you so uh
(41:51) going back to the AR-15 thing though so um AR-15 no ammo bulletproof vest uh he
(42:00) had not yet been able to make an assessment as to the threat he heard you said he just heard a noise or whatever
(42:06) yeah it was like it was literally just like a are you downplaying it no okay in
(42:12) any case would you would you prefer him to have uh not gotten them all kid it up
(42:18) I think he could have done whatever he wanted to do and thought would make us feel safer I'm not saying it was wrong
(42:25) it was just weird to watch what do you mean weird like I don't know it was weird to see the person you're I don't
(42:32) know he just like whipped off on air bullet wait so just to be do you uh how
(42:37) long were you dating him it was like a year and a half at the time how soon after this incident did you guys break
(42:42) up like six months six months okay and it was weird like when you say weird did you get the ick yeah it gave you the ick
(42:49) yeah okay and um so my question is uh no
(42:56) no no I believe that do do you look uh would you want your
(43:02) partner to protect you in a violent situation if I can't protect myself in the moment yeah let's say it's a Man
(43:08) attacking you do you do you own a firearm no it's safe to say you can't protect yourself then well do I have
(43:15) like a machete on me no you don't have a machete do I have pepper spray or okay no well just grant you have all that
(43:20) stuff and the crook has a firearm okay then I'll probably die sorry what's that then I'd probably die
(43:26) yeah but in that situation would I want my man to protect me would you prefer your guy have a fire yeah okay if the
(43:32) gun was loaded and he protected me and someone was actually there great but Andrew Andrew used the word Bluff right
(43:39) yeah deterrent right he up he says get back what picks it up and he says Get
(43:45) Back even sorry I'm I'm just going to even if it was real I think that would still a me out what wait what would if
(43:51) he said get back what would you prefer he say I'm going to come to your house a
(43:57) take out your whole F like what do you want him to say I don't know I don't know does he
(44:03) have to have like a cheesy 80s or 90s action movie oneliner yeah I feel like I'd prefer
(44:08) that he rehearse it before wait question okay so you're living with your husband
(44:15) you want to get married one day yeah do you want to have kids one day yeah okay you're living with your husband and your
(44:21) uh newborn child 6 months and uh three men enter your house
(44:28) you don't know what they have you don't know if they have weapons they could have firearms they could have a knife whatever it is uh in that situation
(44:35) would you prefer and it's just you your husband and your child would you prefer your husband to own a
() 
(44:43) AR-15 not with a child in the house I think because there's there's two cases I mean I would say if we did have a gun
(44:49) I would prefer it be locked away but then in a dire situation how are you going to go reach that it's not locked
(44:54) away it's above your your uh bed I could see where like a baby can get out of his
(45:00) crib they can run over they can load a magazine they shove it in the rifle then they rack it and then they accidentally
(45:07) shoot six Monon a six Monon child there's been cases where three-year-olds have like put it in their backpack and
(45:12) brought it to school where they've gotten a hold of it in their own homes and they've killed their parents on accident like it's happened it's not
(45:17) it's not common but it happens but we're looking at this specific situation where
(45:23) there is a home invasion occurring 6mon child is not going to be able
(45:29) to fire off that weapon uh so in that situation would you prefer your husband
(45:35) to have a firearm
(45:43) um I don't I just I think that's a hard I don't have a concrete answer on that but I would I would say it would be nice
(45:53) if it deterred the situation from happening in the moment but no not just deterred he dispatched right dispatch he
(46:00) dispatched The Intruders okay yeah whether they fleed or he killed them right okay I mean yeah I think and then
(46:07) he said you've just been dispatched that that way it's not
(46:13) icky did I use that word right yes you did let me just Google it just make dismantle no dis no dispatch life in
(46:20) defense of your home uh so don't don't read the chat
(46:25) don't read it okay go ahead um I don't know I I don't think I have a
(46:30) concrete answer I I don't know okay so hold on let me ask let me ask it a different way it's just I just don't think I would want one in my house like
(46:37) I just think yes it would be super nice to have in the case of someone coming to
(46:42) attack you but I just don't think someone coming into your home and attacking you is very common and if it
(46:48) happens bad luck like that sucks I guess I just don't I really don't think guns should be I just think where does it
(46:55) stop where the what are the boundaries where the it's like I don't know I just don't think I don't think what kind of
(47:01) neighborhood do you live in cuz it it does depend on where you live certain areas toally I to yeah I mean are you
(47:09) against having like any sort of protection in your house no I think it's just guns just only because I think a
(47:15) lot of people will say they want it for self- protection or defense and that's either a lie or it doesn't work out that
(47:21) way why do you think that why do I think what why do you think that it's a lie that would be for selfdefense I mean
(47:29) there's been like interviews with School shooters that have been like in their I don't know what it was called but people
(47:35) have come out and been like oh yeah when he was intervie and there are like and they've been like yeah they bought this
(47:40) for self-defense like they said they were going to get it for self-defense self-defense but do you think that that is the majority or like where are you
(47:48) getting that opinion from is it just from those people that go to schools or like what are you considering like
(47:54) military think it's a majority or a minority I think it's thing right so that's what
(47:59) I'm saying is that it is really mostly for self-defense just because there are the
(48:05) exceptions of people that use it for the wrong reasons doesn't mean that it's always assumed that way like you know
(48:11) what I'm saying yeah okay yeah I mean okay so maybe then my answer is it would be super nice to have in the
(48:18) case of self-defense but I personally in my home would not want a gun is it because of the child or is it because of
(48:24) the fact that you think that people get guns from various reasons probably the child and also it's just not about just
(48:31) you and your you and your husband there's no kid there your husband's a responsible gun owner you wouldn't you wouldn't want that if in the event CU
(48:38) break-ins do happen they happen reasonably regularly I don't know I don't I especially here in Cal
(48:44) California I personally just don't think I would want one okay and if that's my demise and my
(48:49) downfall then so be it liberal politics over over I don't actually like I don't have any objection to that I think you
(48:55) should be able to choose whether not you have a firearm in your house the only objection that I would should be legal yeah the only yeah that's the only
(49:01) objection I have is when you say but you can't though so it's like fine if you
(49:07) don't want one I don't care right don't don't have a gun it doesn't bother me at all it does bother me though when you're
(49:12) like and you can't either right so it's it's when it's when people vote for the
(49:18) gun control when they vote for that type of thing that's when when I start having an issue with it personally I don't care if a person individually doesn't want to
(49:24) have a gun I think um that's like a yeah from from my
(49:29) perspective it's like well go after that soft target right you don't want to go after me I think it's very comparable to
(49:35) abortion I think if if it's illegal if it's um illegal people are going to find ways to get it or do it anyways and it's
(49:41) going to be unsafe or not protected or managed um I but then I see statistics
(49:46) from like Denmark or Finland where they have outlawed guns and they don't have any annual or school shootings they
(49:51) never really did anyway um even when they didn't yeah like most of these
(49:57) including way incep has been filled withm with guns including 20th cury with modern
(50:04) guns right and this idea of like what's been going on at schools and this type of thing this is a brand new phenomenon
(50:11) this is not something which was ever common only really started kicking off in the '90s but the technology has been
(50:16) there since before the '90s so it makes you think hm I wonder if there's something else we can indicate other
(50:22) than the gun other all yeah I think uh I think mental illness could be a big one I think
(50:28) prescription drugs could be a big one I think that there's a lot of things that could be uh better indicators than the gun itself my argument for that is
(50:36) because the gun technology clearly existed and if the gun regulations were even less than they are now and yet this
(50:42) phenomenon didn't happen in 1920 you get a fully automatic Thompson submachine gun Shi in the mail to your home totally
(50:49) legal these things did not happen because all the kids taking ad all now
(50:55) yeah well or what literally aamine uh we're going to react to uh
(51:02) something this was uh kind of went a little bit viral on Reddit sort of semi-related to this because I mean your
(51:08) boyfriend or whatever this guy you're dating you got the ick from him out the AR and the killer of cereal donated
(51:16) $200 certain situations are ratified once it happens to you personally if you
(51:22) have not experienced a home invasion or someone shooting at you with intent G1
(51:28) you might have a change of heart that's I yeah true and I think I
(51:35) wouldn't need and here's where I kind of it's gets a little iffy but why would I need a gun to protect myself if the
(51:42) person attacking also didn't have one are they a man yeah that put you at a massive disadvantage a man are they yeah
(51:49) if they were you'd already be at a massive disadvantage right if my man is in the home as well just you but if it's
(51:55) just me right yeah grab a knife yeah you would still be the disadvantage you'd
(52:01) still be [ __ ] then damn my gas light sucks and I'm done for like I don't know what else to say what about have you
(52:06) ever heard the parachute analogy with guns that a gun's like a parachute if you need it and you don't have it you're never going to need it again yeah I
(52:12) guess not n there you go cuz you're you're dead switch back uh let's get this pulled
() 
(52:20) up all right uh can you make it a little bigger so we can uh actually
(52:27) okay uh am I the [ __ ] for considering breaking up with my fiance because he
(52:32) ran away when we were being attacked uh scroll down just a bit uh my fiance 24
(52:39) and I 24 have been dating for 6 years proposed to me a few months ago happiest moment in my life we set out our wedding
(52:45) date for this December however after what happened last night I'm Ser seriously consider considering breaking
(52:51) up with my fiance and I'm unsure if I'm an [ __ ] my fiance my brother and I were
(52:56) all walking back to our car from dinner at a nice restaurant the car was parked pretty far away as the place was packed
(53:02) so we had to walk quite some distance it was late at night and as we were walking a person in a bike came to the side of
(53:08) us stopped us and demanded we give everything we had my fiance panicked and just ran away but my brother after
(53:15) talking to the man for a couple minutes just the attacked the man just attacked
(53:21) the man and long story short my brother beat him up the man had no weapon it was just a fake gun I called my fiance after
(53:27) that and told him everything was fine and that we would pick him up my fiance still seemed a bit shaken but I explained to him everything was all
(53:33) right and my fiance thaned my brother lot however I just felt extremely weird
(53:38) almost the exact same thing you said uh and sort of disappointed that my fiance just ran away I understand it was his
(53:44) Natural Instinct but just seeing my brother take the attacker down and oh my
(53:50) God bro scroll down please uh and in comparison to my fiance just running
(53:55) away I just feel like I lost a lot of love for my fiance after last night I spoke with my brother this morning to
(54:01) get his opinion and he said I should still give my fiance a chance and that my fiance loves me and what happened
(54:07) last night is not normal occurrence however I told him I just got a massive ick I don't think this ick will ever go
(54:13) away and then um I'm pretty sure she provided an update if you scroll to the very top oh
(54:19) wait uh oh it got removed from there's the update right there no no no uh
(54:27) um wait okay s don't click it scroll down just scroll down it was posted a day scroll down scroll down scroll down
(54:33) scroll down there it is I've broken up with my fiance I did this quick because
(54:38) it was not fair to him or to me to keep this relationship to stringing along yes I loved him a lot and will always
(54:44) cherish the memories I had with him but after the incident last night I just don't have that same love for him anymore and I don't think I have her
(54:50) will so she broke up with him literally the next day um but when my brother instinctively stepped in front of me to
(54:57) Shield me from the attacker in comparison to my fiance just running away scared it pretty much evaporated
(55:02) most if not all of my feelings for my fiance I've just learned about myself that one of my L Love Languages is
(55:09) Safety and Security uh I apologized I told him I don't blame him
(55:15) my fiance was devastated and he did cry a lot but after some time he said he understood my decision I still feel
(55:22) really guilty about it because my fiance is really kind and sweet man when wouldn't be fair to him if my heart
(55:27) wasn't in it he deserved to be in a relationship with someone who loves him for who he is and I deserve to find
(55:33) someone who I wholly love all right so it's interesting to me here feel like
(55:38) it's kind of relevant here it's like there's no way that's not a troll you think it's F of course it's F the update
(55:45) was posted a day after a guy a a guy had to have written written that I'm pretty confident a guy wrote it just by the way
(55:52) that the language is being used I'm pretty confident yeah but you don't think that this is a real phenomenal no no I I think he's pointing to the the
(55:58) social experiment is good so the social experiment is asking the question like really right you have no expectations
(56:05) that your men protect you when you're in like these kind of personal situations where your life's at stake and then it
(56:12) it kind of does bring out this idea that perhaps you are saying that that is not a thing you want but in reality if this
(56:18) were to happen I think you would probably break up with a guy and Justified right it would be justified
(56:23) people would understand they'd be like wait your brother beat him up you know this type of thing but the thing that
(56:30) makes me think that a man probably wrote that is because no brother would do who beat him up would do they they'd go write and be like what are you doing man
(56:36) you just like left me there you know you little [ __ ] what are you doing so it makes me think a guy probably wrote it I
(56:42) just think that the social experiment aspect of it is good so I think the question is valid I just don't think that the post is
(56:48) true I think the post is true it could be real surprised could be real men out
(56:53) here they're boys you know I don't think it's uh too uh far-fetched of a scenario
(56:59) where a girl is dating a guy and he cowers in some sort of uh you know
(57:05) violent scenario I'm sure it happens all the time I mean we even hear stories of women who break up with their boyfriends
(57:11) after seeing their boyfriend get knocked out in the fight or something like this happens all the time um but I think it
(57:18) does speak to something where well there was other Tales too like she didn't talk for eight paragraphs about her feelings
(57:24) first and how this made her feel and then afterwards giving an update based solely along another paragraphs of
(57:31) how it makes her feel the impa on her feelings so it just seemed like it was kind of a little more concise into to
(57:36) the point it just just sounded like a man wrote it to me that's all I could be way off but there really wasn't a lot of
(57:42) feelings talk not as much as I would expect so moving on to the next thing uh you said you
(57:48) got uh cheated on and found out when his best friend sent me a video of it he
(57:53) punched his best friend to the party when he found out out he told me and it led to a court case and a Twitter war
(58:00) and now one of them doesn't go to my school anymore yes is that there's okay that
(58:06) happened yeah oh okay um you you're in a relationship by the way for how long one
(58:12) year yeah uh I do you post your boyfriend I have like two posts hold on
(58:18) we okay do you post your boyfriend I have like one or two post on your Instagram yeah like a story and a
(58:24) highlight I I mean yeah not like a post okay I mean I also don't really I post
(58:30) my friends I guess mhm uh and then there was uh you know what we're going to save the
(58:37) tweets and or the Tik toks for a little later we'll get on to some of the other people let's see let's go to Angel
(58:44) here uh you said that you destroyed your ex's Lambo for
(58:49) cheating on you with your best friend what's the story there I mean I don't
(58:55) really know what to say about that she was just a ho and I knew her like her story too I knew her for I grew up with
(59:03) her so I probably met her when I was seven and I went to school with her the entire time um and then I started dating
(59:11) this guy and that's the guy that I was with for 9 months um which there's another story behind that too but I
(59:18) don't know he he was insane like that's the guy who's in jail now so he had a
(59:23) Lambo and he went to jail what was he doing for a crow drug
(59:29) dealing that's not how he went to jail though but no it was just a pathetic
(59:34) move on her part I haven't spoken to her again actually no no I spoke to her about a year ago now and we ended up
(59:42) getting to a fist fight listen I may look small but I know how to fight so I
(59:47) beat her ass I curb stomped her and I put her in the hospital what so wait can you um can you stand up
() 
(59:56) and show us the curb stomp technique that you use no I'm not standing up and doing that someone's gonna judge me
(1:00:02) judge you they're gonna judge you for that you did that's the thing they're going to judge you for all you have to
(1:00:08) do is put their mouth on the curb and just stomp them and I was wearing Air Force so wait you did American History X
(1:00:14) style her mouth open L you put the teeth on the curb you American history ex well
(1:00:20) she can't talk after that did her she obviously can't do anything else with him [ __ ] liar you're a [ __ ] liar so
(1:00:28) why are you not in jail yeah because I didn't do anything hey close close the balcony please close the oh because they
(1:00:35) dropped the lawsuit why because I did she lose any teeth in the curb stopping like one but it was all the way in the
(1:00:41) back so you can't see it which was really upsetting sounds like a kid P I know well at least she had her jaw wired
(1:00:47) shut for a while wait so hold on it you did this because of the cheating yeah because she
(1:00:55) was with him did she willing F bite the curb what did she bite the curb yes I don't know how
(1:01:01) she didn't break her teeth did you tell her to bite the curb no I threw her down but but her mouth wouldn't have landed
(1:01:07) on the curb well you throw her down and put your foot on it on to curb stomp someone you have to they have to they
(1:01:13) have to have their mouth on the curb well I don't know she ended up on it I don't like she hit it on the side so you
(1:01:20) kicked her she fell on her open mouth onto the curb are you shocked when you're in fight yeah are women
(1:01:27) especially shocked I don't just bite curbs though oh I'm shocked you have to physically Force the person to do it
(1:01:34) yeah I know but it was my it's a pretty amazing tactic to cover down with your mouth on the curb I don't know I had to
(1:01:39) learn to fight at a young age so if it was luck then it was luck I wased out
(1:01:45) you're from the hard streets of where Broward County I was no no but I was in I was in
(1:01:53) bad predicaments right so I had to learn how um straight out of Boward County no it's
(1:02:00) Broward not Boward whatever I wasn't saying straight out of the
(1:02:05) burs so uh were there Witnesses yeah there were Witnesses it was at school it
(1:02:12) it was after school so between my school and like this mall area there's a
(1:02:17) McDonald's so I took her to the McDonald's and we did it there that's where everyone at the school would fight
(1:02:23) wait so McDonald's it's so odd yeah is there a video she's investig if I contacted
(1:02:31) her wait so just to be clear you put her head down on the ground was she did had
(1:02:36) you already ko'ed her I mean I had punched her really hard and she ended up on the ground okay and so she was
(1:02:42) already knocked out huh was she knocked out no she wasn't knocked out okay but she wasn't able to get up no okay it was
(1:02:50) and then so she was already uh defeated so to speak yeah but it wasn't enough
(1:02:55) what do you mean like sending a message well some people black out during a fight right like you see red you're
(1:03:01) saying you blacked out or yeah and so I saw red and I just wasn't going to stop oh you crashed out okay so so just okay
(1:03:09) her head was on the curb and then you kicked her once in the head or more multiple times probably twice twice in
(1:03:15) the head and was it a kick or a stomp one was a Stomp and I think the other one was a kick like a soccer kick yeah
(1:03:21) okay um I'm pretty sure that's attempted murder um were you prosecuted for this no they dropped the lawsuit cuz I grew
(1:03:28) up no no criminal charges no how I don't believe I don't believe your story there
(1:03:33) would have been criminal charges if you curbed on somebody and their Witnesses a l of doesn't matter huh I
(1:03:41) missed out on a lot of criminal charges how old were you is like ju juvenile
(1:03:46) maybe that was schol I think I was 16 or 15 so the cups just said oh you guys are
(1:03:53) friends you just kiss and make up sort of thing how was this guy with the lambo I can't talk about it like mid 20s
(1:04:02) yeah and you're 16 mhm yeah badic told
(1:04:08) was it a merci Lago or Aventador I don't know it was a car it what kind of
(1:04:13) Lamborghini it was green I don't give a [ __ ] about I am told that that's what men Drive hm
(1:04:21) Lambos I don't know did the G did the door suicide door suicide doors okay up is that a nice car
(1:04:29) all right uh well I don't know which one it was but um okay that's a dubious story but um if I had the video if I
(1:04:38) contacted her her best friend who actually bullied me like I was ugly as
(1:04:43) hell in high school wait what there was a there was a lawsuit no no no no this girl her best friend took the video so
(1:04:50) if I were to contact the girl that I fought I could get the video wait you said the you said ex just correct me
(1:04:56) the lawsuit was dismissed yeah so there was a lawsuit filed basically Broward County yeah okay well I'm pretty sure
(1:05:03) okay so lawsuits are are a public I was underage so they couldn't put it
(1:05:09) up yeah well they wouldn't have been suing you if suing your parents if it
(1:05:15) was a if it was a criminal case this could have been private but given the
(1:05:21) Civil nature you said it's a civil case correct this or civil lawsuit I don't
(1:05:27) think there's any protections if there's a civil lawsuit filed against a minor and the accomp the parties to the
(1:05:33) lawsuit would have been your parents I'm assuming if you were to look me up now you wouldn't see anything even back then there was never anything so did you say
(1:05:39) that she had a friend who was filming it any attorneys in broud County want to do a look up at on the please don't I have
(1:05:45) enough issues right now the friend was not trying to help her the friend was filming recording she's a [ __ ] I'm just
(1:05:50) saying like if this is real there would be there would be public court records related to a civil
(1:05:56) you might see on the news okay what's what do we search I don't know Angel Ryan kills wait you killed her
(1:06:03) no permanent permanent brain damage no she was
(1:06:10) fine Angel R curb Stomps maybe don't show it on the screen because of my name well isn't

(1:06:31) but okay okay well a little dubious but anyway so I
(1:06:37) guess moving on into the rest of the notes Here uh let's see so we got a drug deal a wck Lambo a guy in prison and a
(1:06:45) curb stomping and that was all within the first what like couple of months span here yeah and you said you were
(1:06:52) ugly as a I really was like I he look like you have bipolar
(1:06:57) disorder wait can you do can you do the like look into this camera right here and then like do the like American
(1:07:04) History X like hand behind the head here hold on demonstr oh my God let me Dem in
(1:07:10) I'm going hit like this you know and then just look into the camera and be like satisfied that you just curb like
(1:07:15) that whole thing can you do it uh yeah I just curb stomped her and it was really funny nothing on my shoulders that was
(1:07:22) terrible but nice try Okay uh you said dating topics you want to speak on you
(1:07:28) said oh boy this girl okay what's you said what's wrong with dating married
() 
(1:07:34) men oh girl I just don't see a problem with it like if the man wants to do it
(1:07:40) and you do too wait hold on just to be clear so nothing wrong with dating a married man but you curb stomped a woman
(1:07:46) and destroyed a $300,000 car because of cheating yes but also but also nothing
(1:07:53) wrong with facilita the cheating of a married man I'm a
(1:07:58) hypocrite okay I mean she admits I'm not going to sit here and lie about being a hypocrite it's very have you ever dated
(1:08:04) the married men no but I would so you don't see anything wrong it's not it's not just hypocrisy though right that's a
(1:08:10) that's an actual contradiction in worldview okay yeah so uh so I mean it's
(1:08:16) not you're not even playing like what is what is your world view like what is bad even I have no clue I'm still trying to
(1:08:22) figure that out too I'm young I don't know when you say do you mean like if a
(1:08:27) couple was about to get separated like they both have agreed but legally they're still married but they're not
(1:08:33) you just married guyss you said there's nothing wrong with dating married men no I meant like about to get a divorce or
(1:08:38) they're already separated but they're still married just by law but they're not I don't see a problem with that but
(1:08:44) not like homeworking right no okay we I promise you what if you were
(1:08:52) in love with your best friend's husband um are they going divorced no they're good but he's he wants to I'm good okay
(1:09:00) if he has a green Lambo so they have to be like if he has a green Lambo I don't care about that what if he's hilarious
(1:09:05) what if he's the funniest guy ever doesn't matter I don't know I don't like marriage but at the same time if you're
(1:09:11) with someone and like you're not getting divorced I'm not going to go in and mess with you cuz I wouldn't want someone to
(1:09:17) do that to me psychologist how you get him is how you lose him wait actually my question I'm editing it so what if they
(1:09:23) are your best friend and her husband are about to get a divorce but she's your I don't think I could do that because I'm I'm not so it depends on the woman then
(1:09:30) yeah it depends on the woman I guess I could understand that I
(1:09:36) mean like me personally I feel like even still being married by law like I well I
(1:09:41) believe it under God I think that it's it's more than just paper and going to court so I personally wouldn't date
(1:09:47) somebody that is still legally married but I mean I do see people they do that
(1:09:53) like if you think it's Covenant if you think it's a covenant yeah and the covenant's broken I wouldn't then who
(1:09:59) who would care if it if the legal portion wasn't well because I still think that that's part of the Covenant
() 
(1:10:04) and I you know you're supposed to why is it part of the Covenant because you're supposed to get married in front of the public you that's why you have your
(1:10:10) Brides men's groom your family nothing to do with societ that has nothing to do with the legality of it and and well
(1:10:17) first of all those aren't requirements no it's not like could you get married on a desert island with a guy you loved
(1:10:22) with nobody around no no yeah then how could you well I believe through a
(1:10:28) pastor you have to have a pastor somebody under God yes yeah okay and so well from your your framework what's a
(1:10:34) pastor just somebody who believes in God no well what are they the one who got online you know they they can pay $10
(1:10:41) why well trying to figure out what what the qualification is is it just like you have you have a degree no like well then
(1:10:48) what is it what is a pastor a pastor is somebody who's devoted their life to God and is willing to teach and spread the
(1:10:54) gospel to others couldn't a guy named Tim who just did that yesterday be a pastor I don't think so no I me what is
(1:11:02) the requirement to be a past his exact standard but then what is the requirement here to be a pastor you get
(1:11:08) a certificate you it literally is yeah that is yeah online to that degree
(1:11:14) yeah so from your view a pastor is somebody has an online degree no I don't
(1:11:20) then what's a pastor like what are the requirements to be a pastor here well just like I said just to devote your life to God and willing to spread the
(1:11:27) gospel to others okay teaching so let's say Jake rattlesnake here he's a filthy
(1:11:33) Australian atheist okay and one one evening he has a vision and he converts
(1:11:39) to Christianity the next day devotes his life to God says he's a pastor is he a
(1:11:45) pastor if he decided to make the decision I believe so yes okay so then Jake rattlesnake at that point has the
(1:11:52) power to marry you if I mean me technically I do think so yes if he went through the procedure
(1:11:59) to do so yeah well what is the procedure other than he just declared himself a pastor online course no well yeah that I
(1:12:06) mean we just went through it he he he woke up at 11:00 God gave him a vision the next day
(1:12:14) he declares himself a pastor is he a pastor no he schizophrenic if you're
(1:12:20) seeing a vision I don't think so necessary well no no I mean honestly is he a pastor that point if it went
(1:12:26) through the procedure to do so what what is the procedure procedure yeah yeah what is that what is the procedure this
(1:12:32) that was the procedure he had a vision the next day he says he's a pastor is he a pastor not if it's like self declared
(1:12:39) just oh okay I'm a pastor well then who declares you as one I would think that you would go to the church and so the p
(1:12:45) is the guy who declared themselves a pastor declares the next guy the pastor declares the next guy the pastor
(1:12:50) declares the next guy the pastor is that how it works I believe so
(1:12:56) okay so what if you marry a pastor can can can he absolve his own
(1:13:03) marriage through Christ yes what what does that mean well you're
(1:13:08) saying absolve like to marry to get married yeah so he wants to get married to you can he marry the two of you cuz
(1:13:15) he's a pastor I mean you're supposed to do like I said you're supposed to do it in the presence of others so you're on
(1:13:21) desert island okay if you're the plane went down bam you're there it's just you and him you've been there for a year
(1:13:27) you've been surviving on fish and crawdads and [ __ ] you want to get married you love him sex outside of marriage you know it's a sin he knows
(1:13:34) it's a sin but you're passionate about each other he's a pastor can he marry the two of you I believe if it was under
(1:13:40) Christ you're the only two on this island then yes then it doesn't require Witnesses then I mean it is supposed to
(1:13:46) be with Witnesses but it doesn't but yeah right but it doesn't require it by your worldview right there's no
(1:13:51) requirement for this it no okay so if there's no requirement for this then couldn't he then divorce the two of you
(1:13:57) also the next day so like in theory couldn't he be like okay we consummated
() 
(1:14:03) this thing that's awesome now it's absolved well yes because well I'm
(1:14:09) saying because you do have to have legal documentation why do you need legal documentation you're on a desert island
(1:14:16) what did you what did you do you put did you put it in the sand you're just there's no no eras yeah like what what
(1:14:23) legal documents what do you mean well if you are on the desert island well then yes because you have the that's the
(1:14:29) agreement between the both of you so yes you technically could at that point but it's not legal no you did get the legal
(1:14:36) marriage okay so then I just want you to know then legal has nothing to do with marriage it can't because if it does if
(1:14:43) that was a requirement then you couldn't do this on the desert island with no lawyers or cour houses or anything like that right so now you're married the
(1:14:49) pastor has married the two of you he happens to be the husband okay who could then resolve the marriage
(1:14:57) him so then technically he could do the consummation process of this marriage and then the next morning wake up
(1:15:04) stretch and absolve the marriage I mean at that point you don't have the documentation yes you could I'm
(1:15:11) going to go have a cigarette I just I don't I don't know where to go with this I could have one too I mean I just I don't did this all
(1:15:19) come from the what's wrong with dating married men yeah because I was just saying that okay well if if you're
(1:15:25) technically still married by law because that is on your legal status you would be married so if you were to date
(1:15:32) somebody that says okay I am separating from my partner but you're still Bound
(1:15:38) by marriage by official documentation some people might see that as that it is acceptable to continue to date other
(1:15:44) people because you have made that decision to be separated from your spouse even though by law you're still
(1:15:52) married oh that's what the conversation was about yep and he was just trying to Define if
(1:15:58) okay what would be considered a legal marriage then or what would be sorry a marriage considered under God or how
(1:16:06) would you consider that Covenant so I mean personally I do think okay if you're on an island and you aren't
(1:16:13) married by that that government policy so you could technically be like we're not married anymore if you wanted to
(1:16:19) there's nothing that's bounding you together by that legality system do you know what I'm saying
(1:16:28) okay I don't really find that conversation particularly interesting so um anything you disagree with the show host about uh you said surely actually I
(1:16:36) got should we wait until Andrew's back on this one uh you know what we'll do kill of cereals question going around
()

(1:30:32) okay Katy Perry okay I love by the way R RP her new album um okay so anyways
(1:30:40) moving off of this uh topic Andrew's overwhelmed um I think speechless no they smoke bre speechless speechless
(1:30:47) speechless um all right we have a where to go with a big lebia clop clop
(1:30:53) conversation it's a tough one uh Chicago has the strictest gun laws guns legal in the USA
(1:30:59) but has the highest rate of death by gun in the USA reconcile that when owning a gun is illegal only criminals will have
(1:31:06) guns Prometheus 73 thank you for the message man I don't know if this was directed to you if you want to do a quick
(1:31:11) response um no but so like Chicago Democrat City guns are legal but highest
(1:31:16) rates of gun crime yeah oh okay all right I mean I said that earlier it's just like
(1:31:23) abortion I mean if it's illegal it's just going to be worse
(1:31:28) um I mean I don't think I think I wish there was a world where everyone could
() 
(1:31:33) just be peace love hearts and there's no weapons guns but that's not realistic
(1:31:39) imag right like it's every it's right but everybody just be friends yeah right but like not everyone's going to agree
(1:31:46) on everything there's going to be violence and like it's going to exist like that's not real isn't this like just an empty platitude like uh in a
(1:31:52) world in a world where where there was no crime or violence or or religion too
(1:31:59) they need for p what is it nothing to die for there's nothing to die for but it's like in a world where these things
(1:32:07) existed but like okay in the real world then we got to have a conversation about what is right like and the fact is I
(1:32:15) don't think we'll ever get rid of war no we won't I you said abortion is worse um
(1:32:21) if it's illegal yeah because you can't get correct medical attention people are going to use whatever they can find do
(1:32:27) you know how many abortions happen per year in America a lot if you had to throw throw a stone I have no clue if
(1:32:32) you had to guess I have no clue you had to guess I or your life your life depends on it got no gun for for defense
(1:32:39) your life I don't know a billion I don't know how many people are in the world 8 billion right here let's say let's come

(1:34:08) back to you angel angel you have had a messed up life yeah
(1:34:15) said surely a high body count is desirable for most guys because you can
(1:34:21) give him the best luck Gluck oh no of his life what it's funny because I've
(1:34:28) never slept with anyone huh watch you're the lies are steing up
() 
(1:34:34) [ __ ] liar Li wait what about the guy with the Lamborghini you never slept with him
(1:34:40) never slept with him Chicks full of [ __ ] yeah they're really stacking up now we're willing to
(1:34:46) we're willing to let the curbs stump go but this one we're not going to let go I don't need to lie you don't need to you
(1:34:53) don't want to lie this is the time where I get to come on here and talk about my messed up life wait so uh a couple
(1:35:00) questions here uh so you have you've been diagnosed by a psychiatrist with
(1:35:06) bipolar is that correct yeah with borderline personality disorder too someone dm' me and said that typically
(1:35:13) you don't get people typically don't have both of those exactly like and in
(1:35:18) fact in order to be diagnosed with one I think they have to preclude that you have the other
(1:35:24) diagnosis no but in any case not the most important Coral I have but so you claim you have bipolar and BPD yes and
(1:35:32) these have been borderline personality disorder yeah and you used to be addicted to drugs I mean or or sorry not
(1:35:39) uh just excuse me you used to do drugs is that correct what drugs did you used to do I mean I did a lot of coke okay
(1:35:47) that's uh drinking no not really but you smoke marijuana yeah I drink but not like any
(1:35:53) other other drugs I've done shrooms any uh psychedelics hallucinogens the shrooms is a psychedelic but no um when
(1:36:01) did you start drinking I drank when I was 15 what and how how soon did you start doing taking
(1:36:09) substances that was 15 too okay when were you diagnosed with bipolar and BPD
(1:36:14) I think I was 12 the bipolar was recently because they were able to actually diagnose it but I'm and um
(1:36:23) going back to this Lambo story when you said cheated on uh he was sleeping with
(1:36:29) your best friend yeah they were doing the deed I guess are you religious no
(1:36:35) I'm not but I guess cuz I wasn't doing it you're not religious no what uh so you you claim you're a virgin I am but
(1:36:42) it's not for any reason I just haven't wanted to do despite you having despite
(1:36:47) you having been in relationships yeah I've slept with women so I don't know but it's not
(1:36:54) I don't know if that depending on what you did I don't know if that necessarily makes you a virgin but you've not slept with a men at least you claim so um well
(1:37:02) I find this dubious because I think I look I'm not a psychologist psychiatrist
(1:37:07) one component of bipolar and BPD there is a sort of uh uh sexual impulsivity
(1:37:13) that's associated with these two diagnosis diagnoses uh you also claim to have been a uh a drug User it's not
(1:37:22) typically common that people engage in these sorts of VI like cocaine use but also don't also engage in other sort of
(1:37:29) risky and dangerous Behavior Uh well I I mean I don't sexual intercourse which so mine
(1:37:35) wasn't sex it was more so making out with people and it's very weird so I had just had this conversation the other day
(1:37:41) I had to have made out with about 400 people and it was a big problem you
(1:37:47) think I'm lying [ __ ] liar you're a [ __ ] liar you do you you do only you
(1:37:53) do only see often times you get these sort of tactics or strategies that come on the
(1:37:58) show and they'll have a Persona that they're playing whether it's a virgin or whether it's a fake conservative or whatever and I think that this is just
(1:38:04) merely a Persona that you're playing because nothing checks out if you doing all the drugs for years and you were
(1:38:10) doing all these messed up things and you're trying to tell me that you never ever engage in sexual activity why is
(1:38:16) that a big deal that I happen because those things tend to go together they don't go together with every single
(1:38:21) person well generally they tend to all live together in the same sort of household well that didn't that wasn't the case for me so what content do you
(1:38:28) do on only f i do solo content so I haven't so you never have a sex with a
(1:38:33) man no not even oral not even oral not even anal no okay not
(1:38:42) even I believe you I believe her thank you what the [ __ ] I think it kind of would go with
(1:38:48) only fans so because depending on your clientele you could essentially I mean I
(1:38:54) don't I'm not into that world but I would think that maybe people auction off their virginity sometimes like you
(1:39:00) think that is an auction of virginity no I'm saying that I'm saying that it wouldn't be surprising if somebody did
(1:39:06) only fans and said that they were a virgin said that they were a virgin yeah but not our right he's confused because
(1:39:12) of her mental mental stage and drugs abuse that's why he he said that it's kind of difficult to stay virgin when
(1:39:18) you're taking drugs and you're psycho you oh not because of the only fans or it's not because of the only no I'm
(1:39:24) saying like for sure you can be Ain can be a virgin and do only fans and I think
(1:39:29) if some psych loing yourself somewhere in Nebraska or whenever and you really scar of the
(1:39:35) human being can you just jerk off by yourself in front of the camera of course you yeah I I tend to just go off of what's evidenced so I'm not saying
(1:39:43) one way or the other there's not really a way to see if it's evidenced so I'm
(1:39:48) not asking you to to even provide any I'm just saying that I'm not going to make the Judgment one way or the whether it's true or untrue um but I would like
(1:39:56) to ask you something so you had said that um you think the body count doesn't
(1:40:02) matter because obviously a woman is really experienced going to give a man The Best [ __ ] of his life right so you would say specifically to all of your
(1:40:08) only fans people that most certainly could not be you I mean yeah but I had friends that tell me that yeah I know so
() 
(1:40:15) but it most certainly could not be you what do you mean well because you're a virgin yeah so if you don't have a high
(1:40:20) body can you can't give a man The Best [ __ ] of their life learn that yeah but I was talking about hang on hang on hang
(1:40:26) on back up back up I just want to make sure I got this right mhm you say high body count equals being able to give a
(1:40:33) man The Best [ __ ] of his life right you have hang on best head okay best head
(1:40:38) you have zero body count right so then you would tell all of your only fan subscribers you most certainly could not
(1:40:43) do that right I mean yeah but I can learn if they'll teach me oh okay but
(1:40:49) only f is not about to me personal no it's not right so I
(1:40:54) mean all all roads lead to uh the Glock lead to grift right lead to the Glock
(1:40:59) loock Queen actually well I mean this is frustrating to me in so far as I what
(1:41:05) kind of content on on the only page it's all solo content yeah nothing else I swear to God
(1:41:11) okay uh you do Post nudes though correct I do okay full nudes
(1:41:17) yep you know the they're sort of like the pipeline of being involved in this sort of stuff and while it is
(1:41:24) conceivable or possible that a woman could be a drug user be diagnosed with
(1:41:30) bipolar BPD do pornographic content on only fans for her to also remain a
(1:41:37) virgin is highly unlikely it's possible but highly unlikely um but what's
(1:41:44) frustrating is I do think you're lying and so about which part the fact
(1:41:49) that you're a virgin it's just so unlikely that given all these other things it's
(1:41:56) kind of like I would eat my own shoe what there's a specific term for it but it's like you know most people you
(1:42:03) know that there's like these gateway drugs or whatever like most people aren't immediately jumping to like
(1:42:09) shooting heroin like they'll probably maybe they drank first at a young age maybe they did marijuana you know this
(1:42:16) idea of the gateway drug whatever and then they get into harder substances and it's like well you've already kind of
(1:42:23) gone beyond it's like it's what you're telling us is like I shoot black tar
(1:42:31) heroin but I've never smoked marijuana it's kind of dubious like you've jumped
(1:42:39) to pretty far in terms of your other life
(1:42:44) circumstances because when you hear other people who have very similar life
(1:42:50) circumstances typically involves some degree of sexual promiscuity too okay and you're
(1:42:56) going to disagree with me because I do only fans and so you're going to say I have no respect for my body but I still
(1:43:02) have respect for my virginity because it's it's who I allow inside of my body are you straight or
(1:43:09) you said you're by bu do you prefer men or women men so you've had I'm just curious
(1:43:16) you've had sex with women though yes but it was towards me I didn't do anything
(1:43:23) I feel like I'm experimenting but at the same time I don't know so you're saying you received oral from yeah a woman but
(1:43:29) you've not received oral from a man no despite being in two at least two long-term relationships with men no
(1:43:35) because they respected it but clearly not cuz I got cheated on respected what that I didn't want to sleep with them so
(1:43:41) are you waiting till marriage not really I'm waiting till I feel like I'm ready I still don't feel like I'm ready to have
(1:43:47) sex but you're ready to post your nude photograph online that's me myself and I
(1:43:52) that's my body I mean you're free to look you're free to make the choice I do think this whole
(1:43:58) thing is suspect I don't know if it's I'm almost inclined to see if
(1:44:04) there's uh any people who know you who are watching okay
(1:44:11) who would get in touch with me and from the hod trats of brow tell me
(1:44:18) if this is uh true or not so I don't know if there's any people watching who know you
(1:44:25) uh I just think it's super suspect well I posted it on my story so I'm sure people can talk to you
(1:44:31) if I'm lying okay all right um it just also the Andrew kind of investigated
(1:44:37) this claim a little too you said surely a high body count is desirable for most guys because you can give him the best
(1:44:42) luck of his life I mean this doesn't seem to correspond with somebody who saying something like this does not seem
(1:44:48) to correspond with somebody who's a virgin no because I wrote it as a joke
(1:44:53) I had nothing for that question yeah but when when I had
(1:45:00) inquired about it you said no but I could learn so the second the second moved towards the idea that okay uh the
(1:45:09) claim of I could do this great thing for you which I could see how that could be very appealing for somebody who had like
(1:45:16) only fan Sims right I can do this great thing for you but then the second it's kind of pushed back against to say well
(1:45:22) wait if you're a virgin You' never engaged in that by your criteria you couldn't do this perfect thing it would be some other only fans Creator who' be
(1:45:29) able to do this perfect thing that would embody your fantasy the instant push back is like no I could learn and so you
(1:45:35) can see from my perspective I don't have enough clear evidence to say that you're telling the truth or not telling the truth I only have enough clear evidence
(1:45:42) to say that the response based on the fact that there could be monetary damage to your reputation on only fans of you
(1:45:49) not being the one who can fulfill that fantasy for whatever simp may may uh perhaps want the fantasy of the woman
(1:45:55) who gives the best Gluck Gluck uh when we disclude you from the Gluck Gluck
(1:46:01) you're very quick to say that you're ready to learn the Gluck Gluck saying from your subscri from your subscrib
(1:46:07) right that's all I'm saying say from my subscri they can teach you they can teach can teach me whether we were
(1:46:12) specifically talking about your only fans then you said well they can teach me so well they can but babe you're doing only solo content right you're
(1:46:19) doing only solo content solo content she is sitting in front of the the camera and masturbating this is all what she is
(1:46:25) doing and I think she started doing at 10 years old you know I mean like uh
(1:46:30) she's that's it she's not obliged to make someone come she just masturbating in front of the camera making herself
(1:46:36) come that is what is solar content if you guys never know it's good to know
(1:46:42) thank you and men they come because they see how she's coming that's that's how it
() 
(1:46:50) works what uh you said you're ex went to jail for murder yeah he did which one
(1:46:56) the one with the lambo um what no go ahead tell tell the
(1:47:03) story I can't he was a murderer that's why I asked you if I could say murder he
(1:47:09) killed someone during a drug deal can we get the story up huh can we get the story up okay Chris
(1:47:16) Snider or Christopher Snider Broward County
(1:47:24) well tell us the story while we're finding it that's genuinely the story he killed someone for murder and I wasn't
(1:47:30) with him at the time right next to him no I wasn't with him uh was it because of like a bad deal
(1:47:37) or something or like no he was just a horrible person like he like was it was a random encounter or was he kind of a
(1:47:43) chunky Ginger Ginger blonde yeah yeah with like a like a dirty beard yeah okay
(1:47:50) and this happened when you guys were together but there's an Inc there's an inconsistency here with your story though well you said it wasn't drug
(1:47:58) rated I said it was drug related no he said it wasn't specifically she said it was I thought she said it wasn't I
(1:48:04) thought you said it wasn't either you said you said he didn't go to prison for drug dealing that you now said he murdered someone drug he didn't go to
(1:48:11) jail for drug dealing he went to jail for murder which was related to drug
(1:48:17) dealing but he wasn't caught with drug dealing I've done it like I've literally
(1:48:22) checked every single month no I think we're just trying to see if it was related like if something went wrong like if he didn't have money or you know
(1:48:29) what I mean like no it was him who was dealing the drugs him and his friends but you know how sometimes like the
(1:48:34) interaction can go bad like if the person buying you know what I'm saying they try to scam him out I was just
(1:48:40) wondering if it was related to that or if it was like was it a hit and run or was it why did he because he's psychotic
(1:48:47) there is like no nothing to back that up with like he is just purely psychotic
(1:48:53) the things that I've seen just was not okay but I'm saying like so it was random or was I guess it was
(1:48:59) random I mean there's proof if you want to see it well there's proof that this guy went
(1:49:05) to prison for murder so am I just going to pull a name out my ass sitting right here uh well I don't think that it would
(1:49:11) be unfair for us to judge that you would know people who were within your age bracket friends of friends things like
(1:49:17) this who could potentially have gone to jail from murder that's not evidence you dated them again I don't have any reason to disbelieve it he was older than me
(1:49:23) yeah I get it but so what everybody's older brother is older than them right so if you have your best friend he has an older brother he's older than you
(1:49:30) right so this is very much a horrible time in my life so no I I get it I'm not I'm not making the claim that you're not
(1:49:37) telling the truth I'm just saying that this has not sourced evidence that you ever dated this guy that's all I'm saying so I'm not I'm not not doubting
(1:49:44) your story I'm just saying that um you you giving this claim by saying I know a guy's name who happened to do ex you
(1:49:52) know XYZ bad thing is not eviden that you were in any way involved with this person that's all I think so cuz you
(1:50:00) curv stomp that girl they don't believe that either now hang on now hang on I think I think we can get like a
(1:50:05) threshold breaker right we get a threshold well this wasn't very long ago that this happened according to the story no so since it wasn't very long
(1:50:12) ago and you were dating this guy around that time I'm certain on your cell phones you got pictures of you with him
(1:50:17) oh sure as hell I do not of course relationship was horrible
(1:50:23) afterwards because I was so messed up in the head in fact since this was so not so long ago this was so I mean this was
(1:50:30) a really short time ago in fact you don't have a single surviving picture of you with this guy because not only was
(1:50:37) he a drug dealer which is the bottom line he was abusive he held a gun to my head he did all this [ __ ] no I'm
(1:50:43) deleting everything why that's what you do when it's a piece of [ __ ] I literally
(1:50:48) went to treatment for my mental health not a single picture no not a single [ __ ] picture because he can go and go
(1:50:55) live in a hole and go and off himself okay okay fair enough did you have
(1:51:02) friends inside of the Social Circle which were friends with him I wasn't able to have friends did he have friends
(1:51:07) yeah he had a friend Daniel whatever the hell his last name was he was a drug dealer too okay so he had no female
(1:51:13) friends within his Social Circle either no other than the girl he ended up cheating on me with was with my friend
(1:51:18) okay did they have pictures of each other together I don't know I don't talk to her well I mean I'm sure that's they
(1:51:23) got Facebook everything like that no people who's a criminal don't have a Facebook so I mean he has no no no he
(1:51:29) has a Facebook I'm saying he has his little kid on on his Facebook is there any pictures of you no of course not so
(1:51:36) so just to be clear you dated this guy he murdered people you have not a single shred of evidence you were ever
(1:51:42) connected with him in any way not a single picture he doesn't have a single picture on his Facebook would you keep
(1:51:47) someone's pictures who does everything like that I think I would have a remaining picture somewhere lost like
(1:51:53) the cloud like because your life is boring you know what I mean and you're like oh shg this picture I Del oh no I
(1:51:58) mean in comparison to this I'm fine with my life wait how old were you when you dated him it was I don't
(1:52:04) know what year was that uh what what wasn't that I'm not going to tell you what year this happened I just said
(1:52:11) wasn't that 2021 no no so you're currently 18 yeah how old were you when
(1:52:16) you dated him I don't know probably 15 14 16 you said I did you say
(1:52:23) definitely said 16 because you just say don't know does anybody recall she said 16 wait chat can you guys I don't know
(1:52:31) but she did date two guys there's the 9month one the 11mon one who said 11
(1:52:37) months or sorry no that was I apologize that was her you you had a 9mon yeah
(1:52:43) relationship and that's the with him with him I don't remember I don't know if you
(1:52:48) said I don't know if you said how old you you were when you dated him so I don't remember exactly my age well
(1:52:55) this murder uh occurred May 4th of 2020
(1:53:01) yeah but I said it well around that time but I said it was recent that's four years ago I know
(1:53:06) that's why I said it was recent maybe they just [ __ ] once and she call it I know I know but can you can you explain
(1:53:13) why it is on hang onang no you hold on I just said it was recent is four years
(1:53:18) recent to me oh to you is that when the article came out Brun the article was published I don't know
(1:53:24) the date of the incident but published May 4th 2020 so that was over 4 years
(1:53:30) ago you would have been 14 and you would have been dating him for 9 months and then I don't know how long between
(1:53:35) between your friend cheating and you apparently curb stopping your friend and then them dating and then him doing the
(1:53:41) murder but before that you would have had to date him for 9 months at some stage sure you would have been like 13 13 the fact that we're going to question
(1:53:48) me and then that relationship is crazy you B upe not because I just told you
(1:53:56) about everything that just happened with that relationship but you claim that you're crazy you CLA I'm crazy but I go
() 
(1:54:02) and get help I'm not that kind of crazy who beats women he killed my [ __ ] cat
(1:54:08) like do you not understand huh was he Haitian no he was okay that was funny
(1:54:13) but but that aside I want you to I want you to just insert yourself in my shoes
(1:54:19) so I'm willing to believe everything you're saying to me have no problem with it at all heard way crazier [ __ ] from women turned out to be way truer than
(1:54:25) anything I've heard out of this table tonight right heard it a million times but the fact that this was four years
(1:54:30) ago you said you were 16 when this happened you weren't 16 you couldn't have been 16 it would have been actually impossible for you to been 16 you're 18
(1:54:36) now so four years ago this would have happened you were around 13 yeah yeah
(1:54:42) but you've given us now oh it happened when I was 15 oh happened when I was 14 oh now it's happened when you're 13 now
(1:54:48) uh your stories and the details begin to kind of fall apart right and so when I ask okay I'm sure that there's physical
(1:54:54) evidence right we can pull up one of these lawsuits nope of course not that's locked behind some type of blah blah blah okay can we pull up any corating
(1:55:00) evidence for this nope can't pull any of that up do you have a single surviving picture of the guy nope don't have a single surviving picture does he have
(1:55:06) one picture of you the answer is no so why would I have that why wouldn't he I
(1:55:12) don't know he's a piece of [ __ ] crazy psycho oh okay who was dating a
(1:55:17) 13-year-old yeah and I can't say who didn't who didn't remember that she wasn't 13 was on drugs at 13 he was
(1:55:25) shoving them in my mouth at I thought the drug you started at 15 I bro I
(1:55:30) cannot tell you to be fair to be fair um I think it was John Lennon who had a
(1:55:36) whole year of his life that he didn't remember on drugs maybe you just were partying in LA and just with all the
(1:55:41) rockar that is just one of the reasons I went to treatment it's dubious it's very
(1:55:48) dubious uh oh I feel like I'm I feel like I'm in X Files right like I want to believe I
(1:55:55) don't even know what that is I want to believe I don't know what that the truth is out there and I want to know
(1:56:01) it do you have two only fans yeah I have a free one and then I have three right
(1:56:07) now cuz I'm starting up the uh free page that I have I have one for ofv which I'm
(1:56:12) starting now um but it's going to take two months and then I have my paid page and then I'm coming up with a free
(1:56:20) one but the free one's basically it would be like lingerie pictures okay all right
(1:56:28) okay very suspect but uh anyways we'll move it on who cares says I'm sorry but
(1:56:34) the lies are stacking up I don't believe none of the stories there was a guy back in high school who did the same thing

(2:08:04) interesting um okay all right well uh okay all right you um so porn is rotten
(2:08:12) rotten yeah and as soon as I left it I find out about you guys and I was like very interesting because as soon as you
(2:08:19) inside the porn industry you kind of blind probably with money and
(2:08:26) fame and as soon as you out it's like ah
(2:08:31) okay during these three years I saw so many girls living mainstream porn some
(2:08:37) of them on the like right when they just reach the olymp you know and it was so
(2:08:42) confusing to me I was like are you crazy why are you leaving mainstream but on now I understood can I ask you a couple
(2:08:47) of questions sure uh did you have a recent conversion to Christianity of course of course you did okay so I'm not
(2:08:55) Christianity no no no because I just believed in I believed on God I find out a God in my life yeah of course it
(2:09:01) happens in this so so did you have a recent conversion spiritual conversion yeah of course it's happens in the same
(2:09:09) hour the same hour you quit yeah I was yes it was like that I was about to jump
(2:09:15) out the window and I write on the paper I what I want to do I write it so fast
(2:09:21) before I jump I write I write I write and on the top I write God will give you the answer and I write the start of the
(2:09:28) Jew because I'm a Jewish and then all the psychoses started and I couldn't understand what happening and then I ran
(2:09:34) to the mirror in the restroom because I was so worried that they're going to jump now because it's just like was head inside sound inside me jump jump jump
(2:09:41) jump jump and I could not find the remove control to turn off the Netflix because I never can find the remove control so I ran to the shower and I
(2:09:48) look at straight saved by your lack of understanding technology look at on the mirror and
(2:09:55) there was um um eyeliner and a draw on the mirror start of the David and I just
(2:10:00) looked so deep inside and I was like oh yeah of course quit porn and the answer
(2:10:07) was just like like like a gut touched me into the mic into the mic I felt into
(2:10:13) the mic into the mic like a gut touch me Spiritual Awakening yes it was exactly
(2:10:19) like that how come God didn't tell you to quit only fans too oh I hope I will soon yeah I know but how come he didn't
() 
(2:10:25) tell you to do that too I hope I will quit only but how come why do you think he didn't tell you to do that too um we
(2:10:31) have this conversation with got one year and two months ago when I visited Jerusalem for the first time in my life
(2:10:38) and I promised to him that they're going to stop to do escorting okay and I say to myself but porn it's different you
(2:10:44) know so that's how I been thinking yeah I know but but my question is I hear
(2:10:50) what you say think that I quit his court now I quit porn and of course I would like to also
(2:10:55) quit so why masturbating on yeah so why don't you do that I need money to survive oh okay right I'm I'm sorry you
(2:11:03) can't survive any other way than to masturbate on a camera I think I can well then why don't you do that if God
(2:11:09) is speaking to you and telling you to stop doing that why I'm on my way well what does that mean what does that mean I'm on my way
(2:11:16) trying to find the way to make imagine for a second I said I had a revelation from God to stop doing the sinful Behavior let's say in this case
(2:11:22) murdering and you're like hey have you stopped murdering yet and I'm like come on my way I'm going to get to I'm going listen
(2:11:28) I'm trying my hardest to stop trying my hardest to stop murdering I really am okay I'm on my way to doing it wouldn't
(2:11:34) it be better to just stop doing it all the question that you're asking me now I've been going through to them for last months all this conversation with gods
(2:11:41) and keep speaking and trying to find what is a really seen what is makes me feel like I'm a sinner so during the all
(2:11:46) the months I'm going and I find out that
(2:11:53) uh that the sin is it's when I
(2:11:58) allowed that man touch me if I don't want he touch
(2:12:03) me yeah okay but you I mean the the whole idea here of you doing corn is
(2:12:09) allowing men to touch you for money exactly exactly that's why I quitted yeah yeah right so so only solo only so
(2:12:15) I want to make sure so I want hang on I want to make sure I get this right M your great Revelation was not that that
(2:12:21) selling sex is wrong it's that allowing men to touch you of course I'm a porn producer as well of course you're going to keep selling porn come on I have my
(2:12:28) own production so then what was the Revelation so wait so wait hang on hang on so your Revelation from God was stop
(2:12:35) allowing men to have sex with you but continue to allow other women to allow hang onang onang on let me ask the
(2:12:41) question let me ask the question but allow other men to have sex with other women putting them in the exact same situation you were in and you're going
(2:12:48) to continue to distribute that okay bro I don't really care about others yeah I know I know you don't really care about others but I I would like an answer to
(2:12:54) my question here's my question again listen to what I'm asking so it's okay for you God told you stop it stop doing
(2:13:02) that stop letting these men exploit you it wasn't like that no he just gave me the idea okay so he gave you the idea
(2:13:09) right so why would you then go on to be a distributor of cornography putting other women in the exact same position
(2:13:15) that you found yourself in when you were about to off yourself okay okay what's the question that's the question why
(2:13:21) would you continue to do that knowing that you're putting other women in the exact same situation that makes them want to off themselves that you were in
(2:13:26) I'm giving you the answer because I don't care about other woman you only care about you yes yeah have you do you
(2:13:32) know what solipsism is I care only about my happiness for
(2:13:37) the moment yeah you only give a [ __ ] about yourself as soon as I will can help other woman I can help them to quit
(2:13:43) porn as well you can help them right now by not Distributing cornography that they're involved in wouldn't that be helpful
(2:13:52) I don't think it will be helpful because there's other born producers as well so
(2:13:59) I want I want to make sure I got this right if I was a murderer it wouldn't be helpful if I stopped murdering because other people also murder why you can't
(2:14:05) keep murdering because it's a direct analogy if I was a murderer it would it would not be helpful to society if I
(2:14:11) stopped murdering because other people also murder yeah it will you will there will
(2:14:16) be less people killed yeah there'd be less people so in this case there'd be less people we get get the corn
(2:14:22) distributed to because you're not Distributing it right okay right yeah so
(2:14:28) I don't really understand why it's why you're like okay well this is bad for me for the moment I'm thinking only about
(2:14:34) me I will treat my own problems my own but you said you want to get to a position where you're helping other women but you could do that right this
(2:14:41) second you could just stop Distributing pornography I need to make money I need to you don't need to make money doing
(2:14:46) corn why do you need to do that that's insane why do you need to do that I don't say I need I say I need you just
(2:14:52) literally said I need to make money I need to make money and this is the way you make money for the moment why do you need to make money that
(2:14:58) way it's the only one way I can for the moment well no it's not the only way you can you get a you can get a thing called a job you ever heard of one of those
(2:15:05) where you go in you punch a clock you work you leave I'm not sure I can get one job I don't have working Planet yeah
(2:15:11) you can get a job you get an under the table job you can do anything on planet Earth other than uh selling and
(2:15:17) distributing pornography like that that how how how could you ever convince
(2:15:22) another human being ex give me an example I will take it yeah go go work as an under the table secretary I could
(2:15:27) literally connect you with YouTubers you can do secretary work if you stop doing corn tomorrow what do you mean there's a million different ways to make money
(2:15:33) okay cool maybe you connect me with someone yeah okay and then you'll say but I have to make $25,000 a month or else I just can't afford to live right
(2:15:41) no you don't know well I'm just saying like it it doesn't make any sense if you say I need to do this I must distribute
(2:15:47) cornography or can't make a living that's absurd of course you can how do you think every body else makes a living almost nobody sells corn I'm 36 years
(2:15:54) old I'm seconding dick since I'm for my 21 since I'm 21 I mean you
(2:16:02) should have done that UC suck sucking dick when you're 21 is not a good idea I agree I don't have education uhhuh um
(2:16:09) yeah it's going to be an entry Lev job like like it's going to be rough yeah I agree it's what normal job is it's going
(2:16:14) to be rough the money is not going to be easy it's going to be hard M I'm not planning to go to normal job I have a different plans
(2:16:21) oh really and is that involve Distributing pornography no YouTube channel no is that's not what that's not
(2:16:26) it's you're going to be a big YouTube Star not not particularly big okay so
(2:16:32) your plan is to stay in media not media Stars yeah this is a plan to switch from the point you're going to help other women let me guess you're going to go on
(2:16:38) tour and help other women who are struggling with the same struggles you struggled with right you're going to lead them to the Primrose Promise Land
(2:16:45) aren't you going to help them get out of this industry when you're when you're Distributing the same corn graphy right
(2:16:51) now saying I need the money then you're going to move out into the I'm going to help you get out of this industry that
(2:16:57) I'm currently supporting even right now right is that I don't get your question there's no question that's the plan is

(2:20:22) how's it doing I have so much hate yeah I'm sure I'm sure you do I love it mhm
(2:20:29) hate is important it makes you get better yeah I mean it just seems seems
(2:20:35) to me right that you would stop Distributing the same pornography that put you in the same situation that you
(2:20:41) were in where you felt like unal living yourself before you decide to have a YouTube channel raging about the same industry that you're still currently
(2:20:48) supporting come on there's no timeing you do whatever you you want and when you want okay you just like go and do it
(2:20:53) and you don't care about anybody but yourself uh first of all you have to care of yourself and only after about
(2:20:59) the other yeah but you said you didn't say that you said I don't care about anybody else for the moment I don't care
(2:21:05) about when do you think you will care about other people when I will have power next Tuesday next Thursday when I
(2:21:11) will have power oh when you have power then you'll care you don't have the power to care about other people right now no didn't you say you want to speak
(2:21:17) to people who have been cancelled I want to invite them to the show to make fun of them why oh to make fun of them oh
(2:21:23) you want to cancel them you want to be the canselor yeah I want to get the counselor inside my show to make fun of
(2:21:29) them trolling them or the canceler the people who got canceled well wait so you want to talk to the people who are
(2:21:35) cancelling or the people who got cancelled the people who got cancelled I

(2:22:00) know them story and I want to make a show and invite them and know them story and maybe help them to get consed
(2:22:06) because some of the dudes that got consel it actually did nothing bad in my perspective but in perspective of
(2:22:12) society they did crazy [ __ ] so then I was like why not to open a podcast where I can invite these people and let them
(2:22:18) speak maybe I will control some of them maybe no depends or maybe you're a KGB
(2:22:24) spy right maybe it could be that maybe I mean you came up from the southern border you apply for Asylum by the way
(2:22:31) is your asylum in any way dependent on the fact that you do corn or not if you put that as an occupation can it hurt
(2:22:36) your political Asylum chances okay I put everything inside my political Asylum because they said that they can um how
(2:22:43) to say they can agree only if I say truth mhm so
(2:22:50) could it affect could it does it they will affect if I will lie yeah so so hang on so will it will it help your
(2:22:56) chances of getting granted Asylum if you quit doing corn will it help your chances of getting
(2:23:03) it depends of the judge but it could help right depends of the judge it could help right maybe he Jer off on my porn
(2:23:10) yeah yeah right but particularly this judge but it but it could help you know then it's not going to help s back not answering the question
(2:23:17) could it help I have no idea it depends of the judge it's a human yeah I know it's a human could it help depends of
(2:23:24) the human depends of the judge depending so some judges he's straight we don't
(2:23:29) know okay do you think that most judges it would be helpful if you said I no longer do corn your honor I don't think
() 
(2:23:35) so you don't think so because guys JK off a lot so you're not going to go in front of the judge every judge is JK off so you're not going to go in front of
(2:23:40) the judge and be like I quit doing that sorry you're not going to go in front of the judge and say I quit doing pornography I'm not allowed to speak
(2:23:46) with the judge my lawyer going to speak okay so is your lawyer going to go in front of the judge and say your your honor she doesn't do cornography anymore
(2:23:53) uh I will ask him to put it inside my yeah of course because it'll help your chances for Asylum that's awful
(2:23:58) convenient yeah I don't know it's it's awful convenient that you decided when
(2:24:03) you applied for Asylum to drop the corn right it's very convenient is it like you see connection on it yeah I can see
(2:24:09) the connection on it too I like but my court is going to be in 5 years but okay mhm unless it's sooner don't yeah yeah
(2:24:16) unless it's sooner right then it makes sense I see but no mine is in we'll see we don't know that right you don't know
(2:24:22) exactly when it's going to be do I have the date what do you mean yeah but it could be expedited forward yeah I know you're right but I hope it's going to be
(2:24:29) in five yeah I'm sure say I got my life together I don't do this anymore you
(2:24:34) should grant me Asylum and make me a citizen of this great country your honor right no no no not like that if they
(2:24:40) don't give I don't really care if they don't give me Asylum I always can marry someone it's not a big deal all

(2:44:41) um no there is one that's makeup related
(2:44:46) why don't we do that really quick um so before you pull that up uh so my position on this and I'm open to hearing
(2:44:53) any people who disagree uh I think makeup is lying I
(2:44:58) think it's deceitful I think it's uh misrepresenting your actual physical
() 
(2:45:04) appearance I'm agree you agree okay is that bad uh is it bad to deceive and lie
(2:45:11) is you sure well I think so what do you think we can I mean I think there's different types of like makeup like are
(2:45:17) you talking about like an a natural look like a fool or just anything like you just think everyone should I don't this
(2:45:23) whole like natural makeup because if it didn't actually change how you looked
(2:45:30) you wouldn't put it on I'm I'm like would you would any woman put on a face
(2:45:35) of makeup and her face looks exactly the same same blemishes same marks that
(2:45:41) you're trying to cover up whatever I don't think a woman would put on makeup if it made no perceivable difference
(2:45:48) isn't that the whole purpose of makeup to change or alter something about I think sometimes you can emphasize
(2:45:53) features well I mean also if you hide like I have a scar on my chin sometimes I put concealer on that like is that I
(2:45:58) mean yeah is it deceiving maybe like a little but is that am I hiding something
(2:46:04) that's would look like oh my God granting that it wouldn't
(2:46:10) be uh the scope of the deception would be fairly minimal uh do you singularly
(2:46:17) put makeup on your on on your SCAR or is there a tendency to put it on the rest of your face too um I put it under my
(2:46:23) eyes I have eye bags like but I also think I'm pretty without makeup yeah so
(2:46:29) yeah what do you think so my position makeup is deceptive just want to does
(2:46:35) anybody disagree you guys sometimes it's performative well so dating podcast I
(2:46:41) guess this is like more so in the context of dating uh are you deceiving men when it comes to your physical
(2:46:46) appearance by wearing makeup that's kind of the question I'm looking to have answered and yes acting would be
(2:46:51) deception sure can you ask it again please but like I think that's where I'm leading is like I don't think so is is
(2:46:57) wearing makeup deceptive my position what is deceptive hold on one conversation at a time please what does
(2:47:03) mean deceptive okay when I wearing makeup okay I think I'm ugly when I'm
(2:47:08) looking in the mirror without makeup so all my life I was trying to change it to being beautiful MH which means I find
(2:47:16) out that I've been lying to the society lying to the dudes to catch the best the
(2:47:21) best dudes you know and what is the most scary about it that I was lying to myself because every night when I was
(2:47:28) taking makeup out of my face I could not look at in the mirror I was like I don't want to see her in the mirror I don't
(2:47:35) like her she's ugly she's not beautiful let me put the makeup
(2:47:40) back you know mhm and that's when I shaved my head it was 2 months ago M um
(2:47:48) I agree with you Against the Machine and I have very long long blonde hair uh so
(2:47:55) I find out that I was trying to hide myself so it's makeup you're not just lying to society you're lying to
(2:48:01) yourself mhm yeah and it's actually it's hard for us girls to know how because
(2:48:08) you know all these um fers on the Instagram and you kind of get use of these fers and you don't really believe
(2:48:13) how you looks in real life I'm telling you for perspective perspective of the woman who's also wearing a lot of makeup
(2:48:20) in the past and all these filters you know it's confusing you and then when you take it all out of your face and you
(2:48:26) look at in the mirror without insta filters nothing you like I don't want to see that [ __ ] in the mirror let me put
(2:48:33) all that [ __ ] back you know so that's what I find out kind of sounds like a couple of months ago you just had like a
(2:48:39) total mental breakdown yeah it was crazy bro was crazy crazy crazy what's your
(2:48:44) answer um I wear makeup because it's fun I think if you see me with eyeliner you're not going to think oh she's
(2:48:49) natural with eyeliner so let me just I I actually don't even care really what
(2:48:54) your motivations are yeah but like knowing that you're not just putting makeup on and it's there are going to be
(2:49:02) people who are interacting with you who are going to see you wearing makeup so whatever your motivations are are kind
(2:49:08) of irrelevant if it has the potential to end up deceiving a man into finding
(2:49:14) you more attractive than you otherwise are without seeing her face without makeup sorry what's that are you going to dat a girl without seeing her face
(2:49:19) without makeup like are you going to barely know a girl and then date her cuz if you've a while you will not let you
(2:49:24) see them without makeup guys can I go to the and wash my makeup and then I will be back in 5 minutes and you keep
(2:49:31) speaking about it I just want to show you my face without makeup okay
(2:49:38) sure all right um so go ahead the mental breakdown continues well pretty most
(2:49:44) women hide it how do they hide it when they sleep when they go to bed when they swim good how about how about like you
(2:49:49) you just want some makeup wipes is she using she's doing it in the can you go in the bathroom please is that hand soap
(2:49:55) can you go in the bathroom please she can somebody tell her I she can't hear me go to the bathroom can somebody back
(2:50:01) there go to the bathroom yes yeah do it in the bathroom please now she's they do have those in
(2:50:07) Russia too uh oh my God
(2:50:15) [Laughter]
(2:50:20) she's going to look like little boy all right you
(2:50:26) know CH so back to the conversation so what were you saying um when you sleep
(2:50:35) makeup okay and so are you going to see a woman sleeping with makeup when you sleep with her right but I mean
(2:50:41) so when when is the first impression occurring first dat within 5 Seconds of
(2:50:47) meeting yes are you going to be removed removing the makeup within 5 Seconds of meeting so I'm not able you still see a person's facial features you're not
(2:50:52) going to transform your whole face M you can make significant Transformations with makeup uh even minimal amounts of
(2:50:58) makeup can change a person's appearance to the point of perhaps catching the eye
(2:51:04) of a man that you would not otherwise catch had you not been wearing the makeup and so I think it's a deception
(2:51:12) okay um now it's not like well I am kind of Hardcore against makeup to some
(2:51:19) degree but I guess women have a lot of issues with men lying but it just interesting
(2:51:26) that women you guys are lying about what we're attracted to that What Makes Us attracted to you you guys have wearing
(2:51:33) makeup that how are we lying then but didn't you say there's like natural makeup that's a little harder to like decipher if there if a woman's wearing
(2:51:39) it yeah there is natural makeup like mascara but also even if I can tell a woman is wearing
(2:51:46) makeup even if I know she's wearing makeup it's not always possible to make a determination as to what she will look
(2:51:52) like when she's not wearing the makeup MH so yeah I can tell you're wearing makeup
(2:51:58) but she could still be attractive without the makeup but she could also
(2:52:03) not be attractive without it and there's not really a Surefire way to tell I feel
(2:52:09) like if you look at a person's features you're going to be able to tell it's makeup's pretty
(2:52:16) transformative in any case the question is is it deceptive if you I mean you're putting
(2:52:23) on something over your face a mask almost you could say so sure what do you think yes take her to the pool in the
(2:52:29) first date beautiful okay what do you think um I think it can be deceptive but I think my follow-up question is I don't
(2:52:36) necessarily mean that that's I don't think that that's bad because you don't think it's bad well because I think you
() 
(2:52:43) can get to know somebody who's wearing a ton of makeup they take off their makeup after you get to know them and you're
(2:52:48) like okay their personality is awesome I think they're a great human being like this is okay I can deal with the cons
(2:52:54) well so let me ask you this A man lies about his height on a uh dating app lies
(2:53:00) about it shows up much shorter than what the woman anticipated but he's got a great personality to make up for it
(2:53:07) despite his his lie is that it's totally fine I think it depends on the person if you're willing to overlook that then
(2:53:13) sure I mean I personally if someone was shorter than me and they lied about it then I'd probably say you know
(2:53:18) personality I personally know but some people yeah maybe no but they have such a great personality yeah some people
(2:53:24) might take that okay would you take it no no what about you what do you think I
(2:53:31) just think it depends cuz like you know like for example like you could put a concealer to enhance but then there's
(2:53:36) those girls that put like tape on their face and like you know what I mean like they look like a whole completely
(2:53:42) different person my D what do you think uh yeah basically it's like to an extent
(2:53:47) but I do think it's deceptive mhmh I agree I think it's deceptive and
(2:53:52) I think it does alter your face especially like even like eyelashes like my boyfriend says I look oh my bad my
(2:54:00) hands but he says they look a lot better without all of the extra he likes very
(2:54:05) minimal low makeup and I found that I notic a lot of guys actually do they like less which is okay and I think once
(2:54:12) in a while it's nice to you know you're going to do something like this or go out to a show or work but in general
(2:54:18) like some people are like I have to put on makeup to go to the grocery store or you can't see you can't see me without
(2:54:23) makeup like I need to get ready first before you come in the room I think that's when it is very deceptive do know
(2:54:29) girls what they think that um I never can find the real guy probably because I
(2:54:35) never present him who I am really you know because I always been trying to catch a dude with my look MH and I think
(2:54:44) it's been completely wrong well you did remove your makeup um cool didn't ask for that but appreciate
(2:54:51) it I guess actually I've been planning to arrive here without makeup wait you have a red tattoo on your oh my God I
(2:54:57) have this you took it off no it was I had a fake eyebrows also and a couple of
(2:55:04) days ago I went to the tattoo studio to make a leather to remove them because I decided also to remove all my tat face
() 
(2:55:11) tattoo and also fake eyebrows because it was giving me also the fake look it was not my real eyebrows they were just like
(2:55:17) so different and then I was like let's remove them as well and they become orange why they become orange what the
(2:55:25) [ __ ] I have orange eyebrows what's going on wait can I ask questions yeah um so I
(2:55:30) mean there are two separate questions what are your thoughts then on like hair dye and or plastic surgery like
(2:55:36) Cosmetics PL well I'm against plastic surgery I'm a natural body supremacist so I'd prefer woman with small boobs
(2:55:42) over the perfect giant fake titties prefer a little belly fat than lipo uh prefer no upper lip small upper lip
(2:55:49) versus lip filler uh what's the other one oh prefer like no ass over perfect
(2:55:55) BBL um yeah so what about hair dye hair dye yeah if like dying your hair uh I
(2:56:02) don't find it as objectionable as like makeup or plastic surgery why um well I
(2:56:07) guess compared like comparing the plastic surgery I guess that's more extreme but like hair and then compare that to me I mean I typically tend to
(2:56:13) prefer people's natural hair color but I don't find it Alters the appearance
(2:56:21) substantially but is that not deception well the thing at least I
(2:56:26) think for most men like if a woman has a certain physical uh or certain uh facial
(2:56:33) appearance that you find appealing whether she's blonde brunette or redhead uh it's not clear to me if like that
(2:56:41) will shift the gears toward Alters a personal or an appearance completely
(2:56:46) like a hair color can alter an appearance makes them look different though not not much better generally girls do it just to sort of mix it up a
(2:56:52) little bit if you're a natural blond and you go brunette it's just change up P
(2:56:58) off you know some people really can't pull off a certain color and they do it anyways so say that's not but makeup is
(2:57:04) like directly making you look a lot better Contours your face sometimes it can make you look worse yeah I think can
(2:57:10) do for sure agree like brunettes I mean maybe this is I'm biased because I prefer women with darker hair but if
(2:57:16) brunettes who go blonde I think they look worse so I suppose they're deceiving me into thinking they're into
(2:57:22) me thinking they're less attractive than they actually are um but uh yeah I just
(2:57:28) curious so I don't know um but was that the other question yeah the hair dye and
(2:57:33) then what was the other one it was just the Cosmetic Surgery oh yeah plastic surgery hard no fake titties nope sorry
(2:57:41) Russia um BBL hard no sorry Russia do you have a BBL no it's a Mexican silicon
(2:57:49) in the booty yeah okay all right um You need to be you need to be fed lipo or no

(3:01:23) experience on the dating apps uh what's the rule when it comes to women wearing makeup on the app my experience at least
(3:01:28) certainly definitely the first photo 99% of the women first photo full face of
(3:01:34) makeup or makeup yeah yeah and then like often times as well like when you meet
(3:01:40) up with them they do look pretty different it's pretty common and then sometimes they'll even employ filters uh
(3:01:46) but I I've encountered fullon dating profiles there's not one photo of them with minimal or no
(3:01:53) makeup you're not allowing us to make an assessment of what you actually look like I mean yeah isn't that catfishing
(3:01:59) right yeah very common there just like I I mean yeah that's deceptive I'm not saying it's not I'm just saying if it were used for like I'm telling you wait
(3:02:06) qu question for the ladies if if you could like let's say we just removed makeup entirely so your competition
(3:02:14) couldn't wear makeup either other women it would just level the playing field for it or against for it yeah for it's
(3:02:21) gonna be amazing makeup's expensive yes yes isn't that why y it's waste of the
(3:02:26) time bro we are telling you it's minimum one hour every day and it's annoying
(3:02:32) each of us I know but that goddamn Society tell us that the woman should to
(3:02:37) wear makeup and they give all this advertising and we just kind of the [ __ ]
(3:02:44) up Austin why did you press that bro why do you want me to shut up no that wasn't
(3:02:49) me that was Austin yeah yeah I saw your finger I just sitting conf front of it's
(3:02:55) a joke um but I'm telling you we also suffering about it I'm telling you from
(3:03:01) perspective of the so then just don't use it sometimes it's yeah can someone just just like there's noral makeup like
(3:03:07) there's some jobs like my cocktailing job you have to do full glam makeup you could that's a performance that's a
() 
(3:03:14) performance I feel like that's when it's like it's a regular job okay here the example when I arrive to
(3:03:20) America hold on let her talk let talk no you're just a cocktail server you don't have to be I mean unless if you do like
(3:03:27) bottle service then yes the image is Instagram model you're you're putting on a face then but like I as a regular
(3:03:34) cocktail waitress I don't see why it's necessarily important I have to do full glam makeup and full hair otherwise I
(3:03:41) can't go to work I don't you're saying that's the thing that you have to do full Glam for your and see I think for
(3:03:46) me that's where because that's where it's like why for what reason are you having to do that
(3:03:52) because they want people to be like oh wow look at this like or's locals or twin but like why
(3:03:59) does it have to be a part of the job because that's what people desire and what they go there for so you're performing for the people that go there
(3:04:06) desire ex put that on for our society why do we have to as women why isn't the
(3:04:12) you chose to do it because you chose to work there so you're choosing to perform and wear the makeup to perform
(3:04:17) understand that cuz that's you sign in your contract you're agreeing I'm just saying in general as a
(3:04:23) standard why does that exist in the first place just because beauty is commodified my C is also have power your
(3:04:30) commodity is is your beauty when you're you're working in the service industry they want get tips girls get more tips
(3:04:35) and they want you to wear makeup and look glamorous so you get more tips I know I I understand being the Glamorous but there's also a lot of people like
(3:04:42) you look exactly the same without makeup in my opinion it's beautiful you did not tell me was a full makeup I can do it go
(3:04:48) but I think like honestly some people don't look the same when they take nobody they look the same no no no even
(3:04:54) the foundation changed everything come on go it hides the blemishes don't lie
(3:04:59) okay no I'm just saying that I I really do One Foundation you completely different person right I'm just saying
(3:05:06) in general I think it would be nice if we didn't have to have that pressure to wear makeup you know that's I mean my
(3:05:12) counting job I don't have to they're very fine with it whatever I sit in a cubicle and then going into that
(3:05:18) atmosphere it it does change and then that's why I do think it is deceptive as well at that point you know it would be
(3:05:25) nice if you could just represent or enhance that natural beauty that we all have I don't I just never understood the
(3:05:32) pressure for it I mean I don't have a problem with makeup I just you know all right uh an non Brian you do need to
(3:05:38) start calling out hair dye with the same energy as you do makeup and plastic surgery it's as bad if not worse than
(3:05:44) makeup total deception especially after certain AG that's like true love
(3:05:51) yeah I with older women it it would be I guess what kind of I don't think like
(3:05:58) changing the color of your hair is nearly on par of plastic surgery I don't even think it's even approaching the
(3:06:05) makeup argument but it could hide age like age aging no it can't sometimes if
(3:06:11) they have like stuff done to their face if they have gray hair yeah so how old are they I don't know that's the thing
(3:06:16) you would know so just to be clear a 70-year-old woman who has gray hair dyes her hair and now she looks 20 is that
(3:06:24) the argument no no no no like obviously she like let's say like she has you know gray hair here and there so let's say she looks young but she has gray
(3:06:30) hair okay go what were you going to say what would be right even some some men don't like gray hair they
(3:06:36) want young youth they want youth wom they men like youth when when you dye
(3:06:41) your hair gray or not gray when you dye your hair brown from Gray you look more youthful
(3:06:48) I suppose but like I don't even like she would look how she would look
(3:06:55) if she had dark hair if she's got gray hair and then she Dy it Dy it darker and gets her hair
(3:07:02) down everything and makes it look silky and brown then she'll she'll look hotter for sure she'll look she'll look a
(3:07:07) couple like a year or two younger she's not going to no one's going to be like oh like you're 52 like they're going to hit her with like 41 42 doesn't it start
(3:07:14) going great the roots or is it just strange look more youthful younger but girls are you agree that we always have
(3:07:20) this problem that we come to choose which color we want do you have the similar problem I don't dye my hair good
(3:07:27) because I think you find out that the best color for you is the one God Made You with I think so I
(3:07:35) mean I don't I don't have as big of a quarrel with hair hair dye as I do with
(3:07:40) makeup and plastic surgery but I suppose it's on the spectrum of changing your
(3:07:47) physical appearance I mean I'll just leave it at I prefer the natural hair color I guess I mean said like
(3:07:54) hair yeah don't really care uh but I also like if she has like
(3:08:00) a little she has dark hair but she does some I don't know what girls [ __ ] do with their highlights I don't know she
(3:08:06) lightens in a bit I don't really care like I don't think that's going to like be on the same level of like she's had
(3:08:12) plastic surgery or she like cakes on the makeup I don't I don't put it the same
(3:08:18) playing field so maybe I look at hair a little bit too much but I definitely do look at hair as like a as a feature of a
(3:08:24) chick when I'm when I'm assessing her physical Beauty if she has nice hair silky hair rather than like dry thin
(3:08:30) hair oh I'm not even definitely I'm I mean like the the quality of the hair or the hairstyle that's another thing but
(3:08:37) I'm just saying like the specifically the color of the
() 
(3:08:43) hair which seems to be the convers he's talking about hair dye what about like hair transplant I was going to say that
(3:08:48) about if a man gets like a hairline you know how you can do like the injection thing this is amazing I want to do that
(3:08:54) I would I would say that that's deceptive I don't I still don't think it's as deceptive though as makeup a
(3:09:02) while of it's enhancing their look no it's still deceptive but it's not as
(3:09:08) deceptive it can completely change in appearance though it's Chang you haven't seen those Instagram videos where they're like you know really like
(3:09:14) they're the homeless guys or if they're completely bald yeah it can change your appearance deceptive you can look
(3:09:21) completely different under a be Beard's natural yeah I'm with that a Beard's natural so and also surgeries like
(3:09:28) hairline Replacements can sort of bring you back to your natural state rather than taking you away from it with like
(3:09:33) fake boobs or nose jobs or whatever it is all right well uh we have techn
(3:09:39) Trooper ladies would you consider plastic surgery once makeup doesn't work no no no any people planning to have
(3:09:47) plastic surgery here I've gotten not plastic surgery but like the juvaderm
(3:09:52) filler once it was like one syinge for like fun it was just kind of like a
(3:09:58) little side thing like Quest I love plastic surgery um but I wouldn't do like real plastic surgery we have n As
(3:10:04) Natural Body supremacist you should also be a natural hair supremacist vast majority of blondes or redhe heads are
(3:10:10) not and it completely changes their appearance especially if it hides the gray mhm
(3:10:18) uh yeah I mean again I do prefer natural hair but I find it
(3:10:25) less uh objectionable than makeup or plastic surgery and there's degrees
(3:10:32) of plastic surgery too uh like if she has it's I suppose the degree and
(3:10:38) invasiveness of the procedure like if she has a a little bit
(3:10:43) of lip filler not quite as bad as like a
(3:10:48) BBL she's had a rhinoplasty not quite as bad and actually I do concede that Rhino
(3:10:55) I think all the plastic surgeries typically tend to make women look less attractive rhinoplasty actually does
(3:11:01) have a tendency to improve the Aesthetics I think of women but well at least if it's done correctly sometimes
(3:11:07) it gets bodged but um generally speaking it it has pretty significant impact on
(3:11:13) Aesthetics um but uh yeah anyways uh thank you and non
() 
(3:11:21) appreciate the message we have a message here from Stiffler ask everyone to rate their
(3:11:26) looks total face body on a scale of 1 to 10 you can't pick seven starting with you go ahead was me total look okay yeah I knew
(3:11:35) we're going to speak about it so then to if I has to put a number on my look mhm
(3:11:43) I need to know what is zero and what is 10 zero zero is the ugliest woman to
(3:11:49) have ever existed and 10 is the most beautiful woman yeah but what is ugly what is ugly and what is beautiful yeah
(3:11:55) let's pull it up um so Austin there's I don't know if we still have this oh I
(3:12:00) don't think the true rape me I'll try to find it if uh okay we
(3:12:07) know what is ugly right huh we know what is ugly we know what is zero zero it's
(3:12:12) dir it's the it's not the one that's already pulled up that's the guide I need the
(3:12:18) uh I think it's the men's the the can you go the do you have the Reddit pulled up
(3:12:23) I uh women's guide can you find the women's guide not the primer the guide
(3:12:29) okay where would it be all right here let me just sorry
(3:12:36) what's yes you have it okay uh we'll pull it up if you guys
(3:12:41) want wait wait actually you know what hold on no we'll pull it up after you guys rate
(3:12:46) yourselves well we don't know I've been thinking about it when I've been driving from downtown however however you feel wait
(3:12:53) wait wait let's have this 10 huh tell us 10 what is 10 what do you think 10 is
(3:12:59) how do you feel I have no idea I can't toate words okay we'll come back to you then no no no you give us what is 10 for
(3:13:04) you okay I assume you know what ugly means yeah and I assume you know what beautiful means sorry do you know what
(3:13:10) the word beautiful means yes okay so since you know what both those words mean you have some standard for what both of them are so so
(3:13:17) 10 being the most hang on so 10 being the most beautiful and zero being the uh most ugly where do you place yourself
(3:13:24) between those two extremes beautiful face and acting and so on only face
(3:13:31) that's great I just want to know the number where do you place yourself to place me myself give me the answer
(3:13:37) physical Beauty just a physical Beauty oh just a physical
(3:13:43) Beauty five okay um you have no reference you have no
(3:13:49) reference your reference um body too everything just just your
(3:13:58) physical appearance physical well you can do total we do total Face Body total F oh can you come back to
(3:14:08) me yes I think you're I think we can't because I think that collectively if you
(3:14:14) hear X other women say x other number that you'll try to mimic that rather than give us the actual answer uh I'd
(3:14:20) say six maybe okay wait so do total face
(3:14:26) Bonnie um and what does mean total like as a
(3:14:35) whole so what do you write your body what do you write your face what do you what do you write the the total
(3:14:43) um total I'll say six face six body
(3:14:49) five but give me a 6.5 total face six you inant sry it's a
(3:14:57) combination of both it's like both together so what do you consider the overall overall I mean overall I feel
(3:15:04) like a 6.5 okay um when I look at myself in the mirror alone I would say a 10 but
(3:15:09) then I start to compare myself to others I would say seven or eight so I'm going to equalize that to a
(3:15:15) solid8 four okay mhm five total six total let's do face body
(3:15:23) though break it break it down uh face like five and then body like six okay
(3:15:30) yeah I'm the same face like a five body like a six um i' would say face I would pick
(3:15:37) seven we can't probably six I wish I had beautiful girl thank you um body I I
(3:15:45) don't know no everyone need to beting themselves higher I don't know I'm like maybe I
(3:15:51) said everyone needs to be rating themselves higher like these are such low numbers let them write themselves and then we'll talk it's hard to pick
(3:15:58) cuz everyone has different taste and like you might think one body is a certain way you know uh Jake what do you write yourself I'll go I seems high
(3:16:05) minded but 66 that's what I always say 6 six total six
(3:16:12) 42 no you're better than that uh uh five face four body so 4.5 I
(3:16:20) guess total um you think people should rate themselves higher yeah because I
(3:16:27) think it's like yes beauty is subjective but there's also yes a universal Beauty but I think when you look at yourself
(3:16:33) you shouldn't be rating based on how you compare yourself to other people but how you view yourself and but we live in
(3:16:40) society those two well those two concepts don't match so if you say
(3:16:45) beauty subjective I age age but then you say but there's Universal standards well
(3:16:50) that's not subjective it's a universal standard I think I think it's it's not as black and white I think there's Universal standards especially um in
(3:16:57) comparison to different countries well what would those Universal standards be I think in America it would be well that
(3:17:02) that's not Universal then okay then I take back the word Universal I think in each country or
(3:17:08) region there's there's a different standard yeah there's a different standard do you really you think so you
(3:17:13) don't think that there's like a thing which never seen those videos where they kind like put together they they've had surveys and then they kind of like
(3:17:19) create like an AI version of what like the most beautiful woman in that country looks like yeah but it it seems to me
(3:17:25) that the like symmetrical features across the board are exactly people are always after essentially the same thing
() 
(3:17:31) that would be I think a universal quality of beauty yeah so that would be everybody though yeah so that's not subjective then but I think Beauty can
(3:17:37) also be subjective yeah but I so I don't want to talk past each other right so try to try to not do that I think that
(3:17:44) aspects of it can be subjective preference T but I do think there's universals and
(3:17:50) I think that like you would believe in evolution right okay so I mean it it
(3:17:56) would make sense for instance for men to have preferences towards youth because that's what is going to signify
(3:18:02) fertility right so I mean if that if there's going to be markers for what is youthful less lines on the skin more
(3:18:09) angular features less weight on the body things like that right so if that if that's the case then I I think we're not
(3:18:15) really in disagreement right I don't think we are yeah
(3:18:20) yeah but you said that you think people should rate themselves higher yeah
(3:18:26) because I think when you're rating yourself I mean someone can rate you and be like six or 10 like depending on what
(3:18:32) they think is attractive but I think when you're rating yourself I think I mean this is my coming from the world
(3:18:37) needs to be peace love you know like I think when you rate yourself it should be high yeah like I think you should
(3:18:43) think of yourself as a beautiful human being just because you're human and M that's funny I would rate these girls
(3:18:49) higher than they rated themselves yeah I think we all will do they're oh pretty everyone's really
(3:18:56) pretty here and I would rate them higher than how do you think they should rate you I don't know I I don't know what
(3:19:01) they see as pretty I don't know if they see me as pretty I don't know wait so question for you though
(3:19:08) uh do you think uh have you ever known a guy who thought he was more attractive
(3:19:13) than he actually was not looks even just he thought he thought he was [ __ ]
(3:19:18) [ __ ] most definitely what's so and you think that's wrong right no I think if
(3:19:24) they view themselves that way then great love are they less attractive because they are that way cocky yeah cocky
(3:19:32) cockiness is not attractive so if you think you're on confidence yeah there's
(3:19:39) a difference there's a difference between confidence and cocky right but so if a woman who is clearly
(3:19:45) unattractive yeah thinks she's on par with the most beautiful women in the
(3:19:51) world mhm is this not being cocky or is it just is it confidence which is it
(3:19:58) confidence oh it's confidence if the if a just clearly unattractive woman who's
(3:20:04) obese her arm is missing I don't even [ __ ] know that's the one Andrew likes to say she's [ __ ] an ampute or some
(3:20:10) [ __ ] some still [ __ ] ampute [ __ ] um wait so why is it
(3:20:19) confidence for women to be delusional but it's cocky it's confident on both
(3:20:26) ends you are you it's confidence on both end are you attracted to confident men yeah so are you attracted to men who
() 
(3:20:32) think they're hot [ __ ] but they're not no but that's the same why are you able to make the determination I didn't say that you said you were able you knew men
(3:20:39) who thought they were hot [ __ ] but your assessment of them was that they were not hot [ __ ] but they're confident
(3:20:45) aren't women attracted to confidence I'm confused I think there's a difference between cocky and confidence though with
(3:20:50) like the way you act about it like let's say like confident huh you guys said it was confidence that's why so let's say
(3:20:57) let's say like a guy's cocky and he's going to be like all like I'm I'm this I'm that just trying to like downplay everybody near him but if he's confident
(3:21:03) he's like I feel good about myself like you guys should too like there's a motivational conf I don't even think it's that that's the case with guys I
(3:21:09) think generally when we're talking about Charisma a confident guy is a guy who outwardly projects having um having
(3:21:16) whatever it takes to be confident but he also can be self-deprecating as well he
(3:21:21) he he appears to be a high value guy or whatever but he doesn't really have to say that outwards he justs exactly cuz
(3:21:28) he's confident so he like yeah but he wouldn't be he wouldn't be there saying look at me I'm a 10 exactly that's that's what cocky is [ __ ] is like
(3:21:35) delusional confidence so then so then it would confidence yeah and you're allowed to be
(3:21:40) delusional I don't know I just think not delusional it's not good well yeah it's
(3:21:46) not so let me um make cop my why would you why would you bring yourself down and hate yourself just because you don't
(3:21:51) think you're beautiful like in a universal standard I don't know I like I get that like someone not being as
(3:21:56) attractive cuz they're too cocky but I don't think that should change how they view themselves like whatever do your thing
(3:22:04) we I'm still a little confused though because women don't like cocky
(3:22:10) guys and you you're able to make a determination as to you all were like
(3:22:16) almost smiling and giggling and like yes I know plenty of men who like think
(3:22:21) they're they're the [ __ ] but they're not
(3:22:26) but how can you make that determination about men but not women I didn't say
(3:22:32) that towards both yeah I think it's both a girl could be like I but when I said no when I said there was a like clearly
(3:22:37) unattractive woman clearly but she thought she was on par with the most
(3:22:43) beautiful women in the world all of you said that she was confident not khy but
(3:22:48) it's just like how he said how he said like confidence like you don't have to tell people I said the opposite so I
(3:22:53) said for a guy if you look at like typically look at typically charismatic
(3:22:59) guys you might think of like Russell Brown Russell Brand uh Chris Hemsworth
(3:23:04) Robert Downey Jr people like this generally they're charismatic and confident but they will never outwardly
(3:23:09) say oh look at me look at me they'll just project that in a way that they don't have to say it and they they also have an ability to be self-deprecating
(3:23:15) as well exactly that's what I'm saying is like people who are confident they don't have to like you know let people know because they they with the girl in
(3:23:22) this example the the toad that we're talking about if she's saying look at me I'm a 10 I'm I'm on par with the most
(3:23:27) that would be delusion that would she's just projecting her insecurities and her so how that Co confident I didn't what
(3:23:34) do you mean oh there's different Behavior she can behave different she can be very ugly but behave like she's
(3:23:39) beautiful without like going and Screen about it but we just said that she thinks that she's on par with the most
(3:23:46) beautiful woman in the world so there would be an element of delusion there right yeah you're right yeah so that wouldn't be confident that would be
(3:23:52) delusional no if she thinks she's on part with the most like it's delusional delusional yes right you guys all said
(3:23:58) that she's confident but let's say she feels confident she's not bragging about it then she's confident she's humble
(3:24:04) she's confident if she feels as though she the that's what hang on that's fair let me let me kind of dive into this
(3:24:10) real quick just to kind of back up Jake's Point here let me ask this question a different way 0 to 10 on
(3:24:17) looks not just a physical assessment everything the entire package including how you feel 0 to 10 9.5 okay um I'd
(3:24:28) keep it a six a nine still 88 and a half wait wait ask me one more time it's the pull package
(3:24:35) now it's the attitude it's the confidence it's the competence it's rate myself yeah what you would rate yourself
(3:24:41) with like my personality wise yeah everything yeah like a nine nine yeah I to include personality probably an eight
(3:24:48) yeah I would pick seven again but I probably I don't know I got to work on
(3:24:53) some things make character yeah so so i' probably I know
(3:24:58) six so how come I'm not supposed to think that's cocky because you ask us we were not
(3:25:06) planning to say about it and brag about it makes someone cocky so this well so
(3:25:12) this is the question right question is asking if you know that there are men
(3:25:19) who definitely would rate themselves a 10 who definitely don't belong in that 10 category even if you take all the
(3:25:25) package right the the bravado whatever you want to call it they definitely don't belong there you would say that
(3:25:32) that's delusional right no like no you're not the [ __ ] bro you're not the [ __ ] you're full of [ __ ] right there's a
(3:25:38) false sense of confidence which comes with it that's what bravado is isn't it no you wouldn't say that confidence oh
(3:25:44) so you've never you've never run into men who give themselves kind of a a [ __ ] then yeah you're cocky because
(3:25:51) you think you're the [ __ ] and you think you're above other people I think when you think you're somebody else then that's cocky but when you're I don't
(3:25:56) know why you can't be an [ __ ] and not think that you're an ugly bastard like I don't I don't see how these two things
(3:26:02) correlate at all like I don't see why you couldn't think that you're really really really ugly and still be a
(3:26:08) [ __ ] jerk like I don't I don't get that I mean yeah you could be a jerk because you're really really ugly yeah sure you could be an [ __ ] for like
(3:26:13) 800 different reasons it it has no requirement whatsoever to I I think cockiness is when you think you're above
(3:26:20) someone else based on anyone of your traes you think you're above other women right based on your tra that well but
(3:26:27) but do you agree that there has to be at least some women who are going to rate
(3:26:33) themselves less than an 8.5 their overall package yes okay well then you're rating yourself over them
(3:26:39) right no because I think you're rating yourself based on how you view yourself not what about your full packages how
(3:26:45) much you okay so if that's true then or at least hopefully hope that's fair so then you would say every woman at the
(3:26:51) table is a 10 I wouldn't cuz I don't know hang on hang on you would say every woman at the
(3:26:57) table's a 10 right I don't think I could rate them because I think ratings ratings are how
(3:27:03) you rate yourself I think they're beautiful women I don't enough to rate a whole package
(3:27:08) well you're not prettier than any of them no of course yeah of course not do you think you're more attractive than
(3:27:14) these guys next to I think that this girl they must be beautiful on this room yeah but but but I want you I want you
(3:27:19) to think about this objectively right you say you kind of you kind of put yourself in your own trap here say Okay
(3:27:25) cockiness is you thinking that you are in some way better looking or more beautiful or in some way above somebody
(3:27:32) else right well this would mean that the least attractive woman on planet Earth
(3:27:37) if you compared yourself to her you would have to put yourself on par with her how's that not
(3:27:43) delusional no I think it is I think in some form we're all a little delusional yeah I think that's the key difference
(3:27:48) that's the key difference yeah and Cockiness and delusion is the is the language error that we're having here
(3:27:53) because I think cocky generally means that you just kind of carry yourself like a bit of an [ __ ] right but
(3:27:59) delusion is thinking that you're much higher up than you actually are but that's when I think you're starting to rate yourself in comparison to other
(3:28:05) people but if you were to just like let's say I mean you live but how else would you rate yourself if you you look at yourself in a mirror and you're like
(3:28:13) I'm pretty cool like I'm pretty OD but then you're only but but if you were on an island never saw another human being
(3:28:18) ever in your entire life you would have anything to compare yourself to well right then your subjective matters only to compare you to you because there is
(3:28:25) only you right you don't live in that world you live in a world that's my AR hang on that's my argument my argument
(3:28:31) is is that the only thing for which you can compare yourself to is other people there's nothing else you can compare it
(3:28:37) to okay so if that is true then I would say that you're going to judge and assess yourself based on the looks of
(3:28:43) all other people okay I see that's a good argument okay let me think on that for a second think on that cuz that's good that's good well we all answered to
(3:28:50) the question what is our full package but dudes did not we have to ask I did I did answer what is your full package oh
(3:28:56) like the full package because we say wait wait hang on if you're talking about like Charisma and awesomeness and
(3:29:02) epicness oh I'm a [ __ ] 14 for sure 14 maybe 15 like there's not even a number
(3:29:08) on that scale yeah I'm just I'm awesome bang bang average sixes all
(3:29:14) around and what about you
(3:29:19) uh H maybe like a six I'm a solid six I'd
(3:29:27) say maybe like yeah yeah six probably probably okay yeah I like six six is a
(3:29:32) good number you like [Music]
(3:29:39) six bathroom check bathroom check oh she was talking about inches
(3:29:48) wait what I oh what the um oh also we have a question
() 
(3:29:55) related to this uh will you be better looking in 10 years's time better looking in 10 years time what does mean
(3:30:02) better looking when you're 46 will you be better looking than you are right now God I hope do you think you will
(3:30:09) realistically I can realistic clim I can okay so you're 36 now will you be
(3:30:15) better looking at 56 no w at 56 better
(3:30:20) than now no but better looking at 46 it can be yeah if I switch to some and then
(3:30:25) were you better looking at 26 than you are now at 36 I've been completely different face I
(3:30:32) did so many plastic surgery on my face it's just different girl everything was different so the fact that you did the
(3:30:37) plastic surgery is maybe because you oh because of my childhood drama of course all that [ __ ] all this starts on my me
(3:30:44) just because I got [ __ ] up when I been a kid of course no no girls will do it because better looking at 26 or 26 I've
(3:30:52) been looking bad already a but
(3:30:57) no now a little bit better than 26 we can say
(3:31:03) mhm the 26 I have tattoo here and here and here and here so you're 18 better
(3:31:09) looking at 28 uh I'm actually not sure because I feel like my insecurities they come and go there's if I'm in a better
(3:31:16) mental state I feel better about myself overall if I'm stressed out if I'm going through a hardship I'm gonna feel poorly
(3:31:23) about myself so I feel like it really depends well so it's not so much how you feel but uh just your your physical
(3:31:30) appearance looks better I feel like sometimes my physical appearance is better when I'm happier all things removed though just everything's the
(3:31:36) same physically do you think you'll be better or worse um are you going to Peak are your looks
(3:31:43) going to Peak at 28 as compared to now I guess
(3:31:49) um I don't know what a peak is but like um the best you're ever going to look
(3:31:55) 28 maybe I don't know how my life will go it depends on the track my life goes let's just say right that you were to

(3:33:39) in oh go ahead Andrew I think that people B private base things around perception and so if the perception the
(3:33:46) sample size of what you're getting is just like endless amounts of kind of narcissistic nonsense I think that
(3:33:53) people well go ahead go ahead and then we'll pull her in okay go ahead yeah and and this type of thing uh yeah I can I
(3:33:59) can understand why tons of men end up with a pretty bad opinion of women for the same reason that feminist
(3:34:05) indoctrination like what what you guys go through you end up with these terrible kind of opinions of men which
(3:34:12) you really shouldn't have at all we'll get into that but Rachel we're GNA get Rachel here so
(3:34:19) uh Rachel if you're listening you need to mute our audio on your end okay and
()

(3:36:39) you want my commentary on well you were making a comment about what if your what if his wife was here is that how I sound
(3:36:45) yeah there was one comment from one dude where he said that all the woman is evil
(3:36:50) and these two dudes was like basically yeah someone sent a comment saying women are disgusting this is why Adam told Eve
(3:36:58) to eat the whatever like can cancel me I want out of this world and I was
(3:37:03) basically like I just wanted resp what are they asking oh yes because then I

(3:37:34) chats cuz it's bugged boys all right so we tried we tried yeah we tried we tried we tried it's difficult there's a delay
(3:37:40) there's a delay it's okay so oh my all right uh so okay don't disag don't agree
(3:37:46) with what Mike Davis says here I do he sent in $200 I'm gonna thank the guy I'm
() 
(3:37:51) gonna thank him even if I disagree with what he has to say and then uh also um
(3:37:57) and Andrew I think was pointing out don't women say [ __ ] like this all the [ __ ] time men are trash we don't need
(3:38:05) men I'd rather wait question would you rather be alone or would you rather come
(3:38:10) across in the forest a man or a bear which did you pick a bear yes so you're
(3:38:16) a misandrist you're a manter I'm not a manter let me tell you why because let me ask you think there's a there's a
(3:38:23) your risk assessment here is that you're going to get essayed by men to the point where you would rather be in the forest
(3:38:30) with a wild bear than with a man is that correct is that fair sure okay so what
(3:38:38) percentage of men do you think in this in the situation would choose to victimize you what percentage of men
(3:38:44) what do you mean you okay in this hypothetical you choose be over man
(3:38:49) right so your risk assessment would seem to indicate that you think a high percentage of men oh I see okay so what
(3:38:56) percentage of men would victimize you I'm not sure I can come up with the percentage because my take a guess my
(3:39:02) well let me just say first my reason for coming to this conclusion of a bear is because when I first think of yeah I
(3:39:08) guess risk assessment I would rather take my chances with I can run the I actually have an experiment for this
(3:39:14) wait but just no I I want to hear this hold on no no no let's finish this really quick
(3:39:19) okay how what percentage of men do you think would victimize you in this
() 
(3:39:25) scenario I know the answer oh there's like a statistical answer no it's 5050 always oh my what do
(3:39:33) you why don't we let her
(3:39:38) answer 40% M okay so knowing that the
(3:39:44) adult male pot well the male population of the United States is something like I think 160 million 40% what would what
(3:39:51) would that be that would be uh not quite 80 million men let's say so you think 70
(3:39:59) million you think 70 million men in the United States would choose to uh no
(3:40:04) because I changed it to 30% still I still find this incredibly objectionable
(3:40:10) incredibly objectionable because there's currently 1 2 3 4
(3:40:16) four five men sorry my Math's [ __ ] terrible in the studio okay so two of
(3:40:21) the men in the studio are rapists is that what you're saying I'm not saying they're rapists I'm just saying I'd probably rather be in a forest with a
(3:40:27) bear than men that I don't know or trust because I could end up getting I mean it's even like a conversation sometimes
(3:40:33) I just don't want have you ever had a one night stand yes how many one night stands have you had one H interesting
(3:40:40) how that works um what do you mean by that well I mean you you you were alone with a yeah I'm not saying I'm not
(3:40:46) saying I'm okay with that or that I like it was a great decision I regret it
(3:40:52) right but right it was consensual right okay it's just interesting women will
(3:40:57) like hook up with the dudes meet up with them no issues you pass by hundreds if
(3:41:03) not thousands of men all the time none of them do anything to you but you have this bias against men that's interesting
(3:41:10) I don't have a bias it's absolutely hold on how is it not a bias where you think
(3:41:16) 30% of men and you originally said 40 you think 30% of men are inclined to
(3:41:22) violence or sexual assort towards you yeah living under score donated $200
(3:41:30) that's a b old Brian oh it'll work Andrew proceeds to be the worst moment in technology history someone Spike his
(3:41:38) drink with OIC Andrew just TNS debate spey he's hot okay that's I something
(3:41:45) you need it yeah they're laughing back there oh there's another one coming through we have another one coming through the living thank you man for the
(3:41:51) TTS appreciate it well come back to it here in just a sec but Noah has one coming in thank you Noah appreciate it
(3:41:58) Noah donated $200 women says that she hates men you
(3:42:03) go girl slay Queen man says he hates women and everyone loses their minds can
(3:42:09) I seems like Shing is feminist to me should hold on hold on to separate the
(3:42:16) bear versus man argument with my my dislike towards his comment because I'm
(3:42:23) not coming from a place of f all men like I hate all men because that's not how I feel I think a lot of men are
(3:42:28) great and awesome but I also think that that's a totally different comment
(3:42:34) to make to say wait you think all men are inclined to violence murder and Essay no no no no
(3:42:42) not all men I just think more men 40% more men than women I would take my
(3:42:49) chances but it's hold on but even though the percentage chance of you being with
(3:42:54) a man who wouldn't do these things is greater it's enough men enough men that
(3:43:01) you would rather take a path that lands you in a forest not with a man Mike
(3:43:07) Davis said I've tried to see the good side of women but I'm done with these
(3:43:12) disgusting creatures right and he says keep females away from me isn't this
(3:43:17) just sort of essentially the mirror of what you're saying by picking the bear no absolutely it absolutely is
(3:43:26) yes all right then sure he's valid in his comment great I think what he said was awesome and I do think why aren't
(3:43:31) any of the ladies disavowing your statement what do you mean you think 30%
(3:43:38) of men would be inclined to violence towards you I don't know the statistics that's just how I feel that's yes that's
(3:43:43) how you feel okay it's still an objectionable thing how many men are in prison because of sa a lot how many
() 
(3:43:51) though a lot exactly yeah the better question what percentage of men are oh it's a very low percent my thing is I I
(3:43:58) think more men are worse than more women but does that does not make the majority of men that does not make not worse I
(3:44:07) think less I'm taking you're taking you're saying there's more worse men than there are worse women more men have
(3:44:12) done have done essay have done murders have rapes compared to women it's
(3:44:18) statistically proven I don't know the statistics off the top of my head but that does not mean that I think that the majority of men are Apex this is this is
(3:44:25) an apex fallacy first of all so okay criminality is a very very small
(3:44:31) proportion of the population so to say that I'm going to have this sort of blanket assessment of men due to a small
(3:44:37) proportion of some men's criminality you you're attributing to the group the
(3:44:43) actions of a small fraction this should be the same argument towards racism so that would be the same
(3:44:49) argument you would make in Reverse for RAC yeah sure so if you were to say okay a small percentage of the population
(3:44:55) which happens to be this race conducts x amount of crimes you would immediately look for ulterior reasons why they were
(3:45:02) criminals absent the race right okay but how come you won't do that when it comes to men right okay no that's that's a
(3:45:09) good argument yeah wouldn't that be this it's the same thing in Reverse isn't it I think on that one too too you
(3:45:15) you're com back with some good arguments I'll say it's so sad that you feel scared by 30% of the men this is so sad
(3:45:23) and actually the better question is like like why the young woman feels like that
(3:45:28) why she scares of the 30% of the men they didn't indoctrinate and brainwashed sure or may happened before maybe it's
(3:45:35) happened like personally like yes yeah family this is a good question you know
(3:45:41) we don't want to be scared of you we don't want if to have happened to everybody here at the table hang on even
(3:45:48) if it were to have happened to everybody at this table that every woman here was in some way assaulted by a man in a
(3:45:54) sexual way and none of the men here were ever sexually assaulted by a woman in any way that would mean nothing how that
(3:46:00) that we would not coincidence we would not be able to we how would you ever extrapolate that into anything
(3:46:06) coincidence that if all the women here were aay that they were just happen to be here at the same time and all the men that hadn't were here as well well I
(3:46:13) mean it okay well let's well let's think about it for a second right um there's
(3:46:19) more women here than there are men right yeah okay why is that is there a reason for it CU you want to argue with us so
(3:46:27) that men and the can see we're discussing whatever whatever the reason is right there's definitely reasons
(3:46:33) behind why that is the case right so you're saying if all of us were essayed
(3:46:39) we're like you wouldn't just say you're all here coincidentally and I wouldn't just say all the men are here coincidentally like there
(3:46:45) meus well no I'm saying there's mechanisms which moved us all into place right and so the question is is like
(3:46:51) even if all of this had happened right it doesn't give us or give us a tell as
(3:46:56) to the mechanism for why it happened right could be with this particular sample size for instance that because
(3:47:02) you're all around the same age group you're more prone and in a propensity to be in situations where such a thing does
(3:47:07) happen whereas we could get the same exact group of women from a different demographic speak and they have
(3:47:13) absolutely none of those things right so you can't really just kind of say well even if it had happened to everybody
(3:47:19) here that we could extrapolate that out to mean something meaningful it's because we're beautiful and because
(3:47:24) we're a horse yeah that's I'm not probably I'm not I'm not mean like but something you're talking about is that
(3:47:30) men are essayed by women too and there's a very high percentage of that yes there is so like when we're far more than is
(3:47:37) far more than is ever talked about like if we're generalizing each gender and just saying basically you guys are
(3:47:44) saying women have it worse like that is what I'm hearing and yeah women have it bad but so do men and men are more
(3:47:50) likely to you know because that things aren't
(3:47:56) spoken about and it is so highly happens so much with men and it's just not
(3:48:02) spoken about it's just passed over like it's nothing well that's certainly a fair point um but uh did you get an
(3:48:10) answer from on this or uh well no no not really I was just saying so but this
(3:48:17) just from my brain right is like if you say well could this all just be coincidence that all of us here that
(3:48:23) yeah it could right because there's going to be mechanisms which Drive things and so that's why when we do
(3:48:28) sample sizes you pull them from different demographics different backgrounds different you know what I mean that way you can draw
(3:48:35) commonalities um so that you can extract data correctly like just you know a few women sitting at a table who say this is
(3:48:41) my experience even if all the experiences map up it doesn't actually tell us I I do want to ask a question how well
(3:48:47) like how could it like you could agree that I could set out that even if this thing bad thing had happened to every
(3:48:53) single woman here that we could take a completely different even random sample size from the street and put the same
(3:48:59) exact women here and it's more than possible that nothing ever happened to any of them I wouldn't say it's more
(3:49:04) than possible yeah it's not I would say more than possible I mean I don't know why is it not more why I'm sorry what in
(3:49:11) the world would make that not possible can I like get my phone to a fact check because I've seen somewhere a statistic
(3:49:16) that says like it's over half of women that have been essayed or whatever by even if that's true let's say it was 90%
(3:49:23) you could still draw randomly from the street get a same nine sample and still not one of those women had ever been Ed
(3:49:30) okay okay right so we can't so that's why I'm saying you can't draw like kind of those conclusions when you say is
(3:49:37) that just a coincidence well yeah could be it could literally just be a coincidence of course okay you can have
(3:49:42) fears from personal experience she wasn't arguing that I no she was she said is that just a coincidence I don't
(3:49:49) that is that just a what does that mean what is is is that just a coin you're nitp you're nitpicking on little words
(3:49:55) no it's not a nitpick yes how is it a nitpick she just said like that and you just catch it so yeah you catch that one
(3:50:01) thing that bastard like like do you realize that people people's thought patterns the way that they think and the
(3:50:08) way that they discuss things they hinge on pillars and pillars are usually assumptions right they hinge on
() 
(3:50:13) assumptions so yes lock in on the hinge the pillar that holds the idea wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait I'm sorry
(3:50:19) I have to interrupt this I I don't like to let certain things just slide what
(3:50:24) was the stat that you just quoted well I asked if I could pull it up I don't have that you you said you think it's over
(3:50:31) 50% of women I think I know the stat she's referring to it's like it's like at colleges they say over 50% of women
(3:50:37) have been but then but then when you look into it it's like why don't you tell us what you heard I I told you I don't have it off
(3:50:44) the top of my my head I have to look it up but it's something about like half or more than half of women have been what
(3:50:49) essay or raped or what so when you say essay what does that
(3:50:56) include anything UNC consensual that is where they've been touched without that
(3:51:01) so if a man were to tap what do you mean what does that if a man were to tap a woman on the shoulder is that essay no
(3:51:07) it's UNC consensual seual okay yeah so it's well yeah like do about sexual
(3:51:13) touching I have a question um H sexual touching without consent yes and much of that can be
(3:51:19) perception it could be harassment well hang on but much of that could be perception so like let me give you an
(3:51:25) example if a if a guyy sitting in a party he's drinking a woman walks over and just like randomly starts rubbing
(3:51:30) his shoulders right I've seen this many times um nobody's nobody says [ __ ] right
(3:51:37) however that's definitely sexual touching he definitely hasn't consented to it just nobody gives a [ __ ] let's switch it woman sitting in a party right
(3:51:44) doesn't know the guy he run he walks over and just starts rubbing her shoulders do you do you think that that
(3:51:50) would become problematic I think it's odd but I personally if some guy did that to me I just be like what like I don't know would to me that wouldn't be
(3:51:58) woman sure but if a woman said okay wait a second that that was that was sexual touching without my consent would you
(3:52:04) agree with her I wouldn't agree with her but I wouldn't look her in the face and say you wouldn't say you wouldn't say no
(3:52:10) right you wouldn't say no and so that's that's the distinction is being talked about here is that wait a second the
(3:52:17) reason we clarify these terms and we want them specific is because it's very clear to me that when women in an
(3:52:23) unwanted way touch men just nobody gives a [ __ ] they just don't care I think I'm
(3:52:28) not trying to minimize the amount of essay that men experience like yeah
(3:52:34) right but but but this way the classification matters because I'm not sure I would consider that essay right
(3:52:40) no I mean I agree with you I'm just saying I'm not trying to minimize but you realize how many of these kind of tortured studies and stats you look at
(3:52:47) where the Assumption of ESS is is that they would consider those categories even though they maybe don't belong there even worse like wolf wolf
(3:52:54) whistling is in some I will touch you now when we will go to smoke a cigarettes this is called is a s or you
(3:53:02) realize you like so when you went back there to smoke a cigarette did you note that I took a wide path went all the way
(3:53:08) around you never went anywhere near you and came in just to avoid such such uh a
(3:53:13) thing from even happening no I didn't see I know you don't have to worry about it that's the difference I love it you
(3:53:20) watch your back bro you don't have to go smoke a cigarette you don't have to worry about
(3:53:25) it guess what but guess what we will call it as a sexual assment no we do we
(3:53:31) do have to worry about it will it's called a sexual assessment or no I I mean who knows who but because the
(3:53:39) because the criteria because the criteria is so gray it's not really known to me or clear to me what could be
(3:53:46) considered assault or living under SC donated $200 holy crap I've technically been
(3:53:53) essayed several times in my life prob I don't report any of them Society doesn't
(3:53:59) notice casual women essaying also bear versus black man or black man versus
(3:54:05) white man I'm more scared of a white man I love white man why would you be more scared of a what so now not only are you
(3:54:12) sexist but you're also racist yeah just Instant by category but but you see
(3:54:17) what I mean when I say like it's not when he when he ask a question to me it's not altogether clear without very
(3:54:23) specific criteria uh as to what that could even mean because I think that yes I could be
(3:54:30) brought up on charges for potentially brushing up against a woman even without having any untour anything towards her I
(3:54:37) just happen to not not think twice I was just walking by brushed up against her do I think it's within the realm of
(3:54:43) possibility I do and that's the part men always have to think about that seems
(3:54:48) like women as they think that men are hyper predatory right and now the distance has just the Gap has grown and
(3:54:54) grown and grown because you know it's gr yeah it's not your turn hang on so this is this is why right now now that we
(3:55:01) have to think about that all the time you see this distance this Gap widen and it's specifically because if you if you
(3:55:08) look at it like the example I gave with a shoulder rubbing right you're like yeah no that's really not SA but if she
(3:55:15) said it was you're like I wouldn't tell her no and so that's why it's not altogether clear to me it really is we we had a
(3:55:22) girl on the show I think you were on this panel Andrew uh well I had a girl on a show take off her you know clothes
(3:55:28) and like to assault me with her with her yeah so that's not the what I was going to talk about but um there was a girl
(3:55:35) who who was we were having this conversation and she said there was a study done here at the local University
(3:55:40) and that uh it included cat calling that
(3:55:46) fell within the purview of sa yeah I was on that show I think or were you on that show so I I find these studies that they
(3:55:54) do it includes all sorts of things all the way from some you know benign or so
(3:56:00) you know mild harassment all the way to like forcible violent rape and I find
(3:56:05) like encapsulating all of those things into this sort of nebulous term essay is
(3:56:11) not particularly helpful it inflates the numbers I agree I'm not right but like when we're having this conversation and
(3:56:17) it's it's uh I suppose sort some sort of framing where you're saying like the The
(3:56:24) Listener is going to interpret over 50% of women are at like full-blown forcibly
(3:56:31) in the [ __ ] they're walking down a staircase somewhere some random man just starts beating them up and
(3:56:38) like rapes them that's not what I said okay well I'm just curious and I don't know if this is a bit you appropriate of
(3:56:44) a question but I think y'all were like you were saying like I bet every single woman here at this table has been ESS I
(3:56:50) didn't say that you said you were though right right okay so uh just I'm just
(3:56:57) curious I'm not going to ask the details who here has been as H
(3:57:02) it okay wait sorry just show up hands
(3:57:08) again oh it's a it's a you're wondering this hold on that's crazy you can't use
(3:57:14) that as an argument because because a lot of women feel feel not validated in what it is that's right they feel wait I
(3:57:21) do have a follow question it's not I do I do have a followup question allow me allow me to do the followup question
(3:57:27) first stop stop stop okay those of you who raised your hand did you go to the
(3:57:33) police no couldn't no no no did you yes
(3:57:40) you went to the police does that mean you didn't wait hold on is this the guy who the the choking thing H there's a
(3:57:45) separate incident there's a okay and then did you go to the police okay that
(3:57:50) was it that was my question and so you're saying because we didn't go to the police it no no I'm not saying anything I don't know what happened or
(3:57:56) what didn't I a lot of men don't go to did you go to the police so I'll tell you I'll tell you the term right I know
(3:58:02) they would laugh me out of the building right they'd laugh me out of the building even though it was clear on video they would laugh me they would
(3:58:09) laugh me out of the building it's not it's not even it's not even an option for us but the thing is is like right so
(3:58:15) to so to kind of dive into this all all Brian's trying to say is like if you have this kind of hyperinflated number
(3:58:21) which would include things like cat calling or things which clearly are not sexual assault right uh these should be
(3:58:29) in kind of totally different categories and the reason they're putting it the same is to inflate the number thus making men look far more predatory than
(3:58:35) they actually are so if that is the case then and you can even see like kind of
(3:58:41) with your rawar feminism that pops out really quick ra F well you did and I'll explain I'll explain where I saw it I'll
(3:58:47) I'll explain the exact moment that I saw the raw raw feminism it was when Brian
(3:58:52) or when I said yes I feel and you and you you're going to invalidate well yeah
(3:58:57) and here's why you have to invalidate feelings for proof and evidence with clear criteria because otherwise how do
(3:59:02) we get the actual number right you like I couldn't just say do you feel like you were essay right I mean then in court it
(3:59:10) wouldn't hold up but look someone in the face and say well then it didn't happen but can't really hold up external to
(3:59:16) that either because you're a number who would never make it into the stats absent court right because you never
(3:59:21) went to court so then so then but you would be counted in this number so how
(3:59:26) would we prove that how could we falsify that other than you can't you can't right you can't so this is why when
(3:59:33) people say believe all women it sounds to me like [ __ ] I don't think that's true no I I just yeah it sounds to me
(3:59:39) like total absurdity because it's like by your kind of your own metrics you
(3:59:44) invalidate the very thing that we're supposed to believe well then do you not feel that there's a discrepancy between
(3:59:50) the in the categories of what essay is um you know you even said like it's a shoulder rubbing so do you not think
(3:59:55) there's like a kind of an equal number of the people who are counted in that statistic who weren't actually or you
(4:00:01) know it wasn't as Intense or something that we wouldn't consider essay compared to the number of women who aren't
(4:00:06) actually counted in that statistic yeah so this is a really difficult question because uh what you're talking about soft science is science is only as a
(4:00:13) fact controls and that's why science well why the replication crisis affects soft
(4:00:19) sciences soly and so without great controls which means great criteria we're just speculating ultimately right
(4:00:26) and so that's why when I hear kind of these torture dumbers thrown out of I you know uh most men could be predatory
(4:00:33) or most women have experienced sa and this and that it it seems to me that that's not very clear and that the
(4:00:39) controls are not very good and that we're mostly going off of self reports not Court reports
(4:00:44) and so yeah I'm not I'm just not willing to kind of concede that that's true right okay and and I mean I don't you
(4:00:52) see reason why I don't even think you would right if that if you find out that is indeed the case wouldn't you kind of
(4:00:57) have to like readjust your positioning and thought process around it can you or
(4:01:03) specify re restate your question yeah so like if if you found out that wait there's really soft controls here and we
(4:01:09) can't really know we don't really know we don't really know the answer to these questions than I would reconsider yeah
(4:01:15) that's all I'm asking you to do it's just like reconsider possib the the opposite possibility that there's
(4:01:21) perhaps been a lot of brainwashing designed specifically to be divisive to make men look why do you
(4:01:27) think they would want to make men look worse well because I think that uh a lot of these control studies are done by
(4:01:33) very Progressive and very feminist operated universities and I think that they're not trying to solve for a real
(4:01:39) hard scientific answer but rather they're trying to only get at the part of kind of the ideology that they're
(4:01:47) trying to promote and so they'll make the data fit the ideology rather than moving the ideology around the data
(4:01:55) okay we can believe on it what's that we can believe on it yeah it sounds
() 
(4:02:01) realistically I don't want to quite lay off quite yet you said something about
(4:02:06) white men what was the statement there you you said you would uh she's
(4:02:14) scared of the white dudes more if I were given two random men one
(4:02:19) was black and one was white and I was I'm not saying that say okay I don't
(4:02:26) think you can be racist towards a white person I will say that oh boy okay um but so so you would prefer what a black
(4:02:33) man over a white man to be like in the same room with trust to be in the forest
(4:02:39) oh you're agreeing with me yeah okay I thought you were going to disagree I was good SC I'm agree of course
(4:02:47) okay um wait so hold on because they harmless here let's explore the like to
(4:02:54) think anyone Harless ah why it's more dangerous yeah of course all the can I ask you a question a couple things okay
(4:03:00) so if we were to scared if if someone was to say I would feel more comfortable
(4:03:07) in a room with a white person over a black person would that be a racist statement unfor
(4:03:14) yeah you can't you can't use that argument though about because there's a whole history behind that yeah so what
(4:03:21) what do you mean do you mean so well let's let's assume I the white man has has always been the oppressor regardless
(4:03:27) sure well I'm just going to I'm just going to Grant it I want to have this conversation I'm I'm literally just going to Grant it I'm going to in fact
(4:03:33) we'll just pretend that um that black men and women were freed Only Yesterday
(4:03:39) 24 hours ago okay they've only 24 hours they've have their freedom okay how
(4:03:46) would this statement in any way make sense to say I would feel more comfortable in a room with a black man
(4:03:53) versus a white man or a white man versus a black man uh how is that not a preconceived notion still based around
(4:04:01) race can you condense that question again how is it not a preconceived notion still based around race to say I
(4:04:07) would feel more comfortable around this racial group than this one how's that not I think it's a racial notion but I don't I I just think because my belief
(4:04:14) that you can't be racist against a white person I know your Bel but what is it founded on I just I just granted that it
(4:04:20) was just yesterday it just only happened yesterday Ian that makes it even more valid I think sure sure what's the
(4:04:26) validity though of saying I have a preconceived notion about a racial group and so therefore based on the
(4:04:32) preconceived hang on hang on let me finish the question first based on the preconceived notion of this racial group
(4:04:38) I select this one because I think that I'll be safer around them but if you FP
(4:04:43) and say okay but but I agree I agree with that just for me it's whites in what world would that not be
(4:04:51) racial on both ends or racist on both ends maybe okay maybe it is a
(4:05:00) little Prejudice is that maybe but I I don't think hold on let me we'll pursue
(4:05:07) this but really power power dynamics have a lot to do with it hold on really quick though really quick okay let's
(4:05:13) remove the the term racism from this and let's talk about what you find objectionable so do you think if
(4:05:19) somebody would rather be in a room alone with a black person over the white person is this an objectionable position
(4:05:26) to hold which is it's your position by the way is it is it objectionable is
(4:05:31) what objection what does me I'm sorry it's a lot of I mean fast not that smart
(4:05:37) like you guys okay so do you find it objectionable for somebody and this is your position for
(4:05:43) for somebody to say I would rather be in a room alone with a black person over a white person
(4:05:49) objectionable yes wait objectional I'm sorry I so you object to your own position what does mean
(4:05:56) [Music] objection don't don't weasel your way out of this one okay do you think it's
(4:06:01) problematic that position what position to well your your position focus and it's hard for me to
(4:06:08) stay on top I feel like I've been on the spotlight for a bit now and I just feel exp we're exploring worldview so okay
(4:06:15) I'll repeat the question I'll try to make it as simple as possible okay so you said you would feel more comfortable
(4:06:21) with a black man over a white man I did say that you said that okay um and you
(4:06:27) you don't think that statement is objectionable correct no I think it is a little
(4:06:34) bit okay um but then do you think it's more objectionable to
(4:06:39) say I would rather be with a white person over a black person is that a
() 
(4:06:45) more objectionable position if I ask you to repeat the
(4:06:50) question you're just going to roll your eyes and I'm telling you I've told you four times already I need to like we can go back to me but I just need like a
(4:06:56) like a break because I can't keep focusing I'm like I feel like my energy my focus has been sustained and I need
(4:07:03) to take a break so please respect that do you want a Red Bull or something or
(4:07:08) an energy Dr you can take a little breather if you need
(4:07:15) is that I just want to say I'm not really sure why people oh wait wait are you leaving no no she's
(4:07:23) okay don't you can take a break if you want that's fine if you need a little breather on that's
(4:07:29) fine wait what happened all good done I you can be racist anybody cognitive
(4:07:36) dissonance is that that's what that looks like it's very painful so cognitive dissonance is always very
(4:07:42) painful for people and that's why happens they get very emotional and they even men physical response even men it
(4:07:47) becomes a very physical response when the worldview collides with reality well then why we scare of the white dudes
(4:07:53) more than the black dudes it's because of our experience all right I don't even know it was is in the question though
(4:07:59) like why does it matter what the ethnicity is if your whole point is it what she was saying was that she thinks
(4:08:06) that she would take the bear over a man if you feel that way why is race even an
(4:08:12) issue she just said she'd rather choose a bear over a man in general because of her experience do you understand because
(4:08:18) of experience let talk you stop stop stop stop let's not talk about her while she's gone uh I'm going to read a couple
(4:08:25) chats uh we have techno Trooper how does the trend of non-college educated men
(4:08:31) leaving the workforce combined with declining College enrollment impact their dating desirability and what new
(4:08:37) values might become more important why am I supposed to know that how does the trend of non-oled educated men leaving
(4:08:42) the workforce with declining college enrollment impact their dating mean that men are going into trades and they're
(4:08:48) not going to college and women still are so how's that going to impact dating going forward uh I'm not sure it's like a
(4:08:55) question about hypogamy I think guys going into trades and are going to be UC
() 
(4:09:01) yeah you got make them make them um like make them more palatable yeah make them more palatable um I I guess I could try
(4:09:09) to reframe it like would you prefer to date a guy who has a college degree it
(4:09:15) doesn't matter prefer a guy who has a college degree I like or in college okay just to
(4:09:23) be cool yeah I like knowledge but I don't think like a college education is required yeah yeah I don't think so I
(4:09:29) tra jobs are just as good all right we have uh who cares a bear is an animal with animal Instincts by the way you
(4:09:35) will be mauled by the bear just like Leonardo DiCaprio in the Revenant man's instinct is survival AKA find shelter

(4:11:46) on let me just read uh pen maker Andrew it's literally impossible to Source baby seal remains I checked it's more legal
(4:11:53) than sourcing human remains you needs to choose a different material for your pen also Brian I admonish you for neglecting
(4:11:59) your fine writing instrument for that plastic oh I think this is the guy that
(4:12:05) HED us up P appreciate it I'm going to let you pick the material right whatever
(4:12:11) you think uh fits the personality right use it on The Crucible I
(4:12:21) promise oh okay thank you pen maker and then we have this from Rachel uh Rachel it's just the we are Tech illiterate
(4:12:28) it's just so complicated we just can't do it I'm sorry Rachel can I add input on the comment
(4:12:35) about reporting what what's up can I add input on the comment about reporting I think reporting sexual assault takes a
(4:12:40) lot of Bravery when you report it the people around you can view you as lower
(4:12:45) weak like for men a lot of men don't report it because they feel that they're going to look lower they're going to be
(4:12:51) embarrassed like your family's going to view you differently it it's a big thing it's scary it also sucks when like the
(4:12:56) person who did it is like the closest person to you in your family like it's hard there's so many instances that make
(4:13:03) it difficult to report it's hard that's all I want to say s i don't disagree but
(4:13:09) what the commenter was saying is he's he's alluding to a high Duty or responsibility he's saying look is there
(4:13:16) even though it's hard yeah even though it's rough even though it sucks even though it's not something you want to do
(4:13:22) right because after all this is not your fault that this happened to you right yeah there's many such cases of things
(4:13:28) which are not your fault uh for instance you could be walking down the street and see a woman getting kidnapped right
(4:13:34) that's not your fault yeah but don't you have a duty to report it yes so that's what that's it that's not personal
(4:13:40) that's hang on hang on hang on yeah continue um whether it's personal or not I think is irrelevant you're talking
(4:13:45) about what he's saying is if you have this higher Duty so that you can prevent this from happening to the next person
(4:13:52) then shouldn't you do it were you sex did you report your sexual assault no I just told you why though it doesn't
(4:13:58) matter what I would say wait why because they I would be laughed out of the building regardless of what I I said
(4:14:04) told the police yeah yeah they don't care you don't know cuz you never tried you're not going to stop that woman from
(4:14:09) assaulting other people you know that's true if you go report yours I'll go report mine I did thank you if if you
(4:14:16) guys report yours I'll go report mine it's just hard though cuz like some people like they'll make threats to like oh if you say anything like this is
(4:14:22) going to happen especially when it's family it's hard I'm not sure I I mean we kind of
(4:14:29) like tongue and cheek it that it was sa it was more like it was more like just a freak doing weird freak [ __ ] but um I
(4:14:37) you know I just think it's if it made you uncomfortable then then I should go go report it yeah should she do time I
() 
(4:14:43) think do time I don't know what time she do time wait did we go all the way around the table on the like better
(4:14:48) looking in 10 years time no no we stopped here I mean with you yeah better looking in 10 years time I have no clue
(4:14:55) probably not okay yes yeah so you're uh 22 right 21
(4:15:01) 21 is trans uh so better looking at 31 uh yeah I think I'll look more like I'll fit into I'll look more sophisticated
(4:15:07) more like grown up more like professional you would take the genie deal huh you would take the genie deal
(4:15:13) what is that we age you four to 10 years but there's no negative Health ramifications you would do it I don't know what that means so there's so so if
(4:15:20) you age 10 years from now right it's going to take x amount of days off your life right cuz you get 10 years older MH
(4:15:27) so let's let's pretend that we could just wave a wand now you're 10 years ahead but I still look the same no no no
(4:15:34) you look like you're 10 years ahead but physically you're exactly the same you haven't lost any lifespan at all would
(4:15:41) you take the deal uh yes I would you would like knowledgy
(4:15:46) and more like physically I feel like I would look more professional sophisticated in what I'm doing what I want to do so I would feel a lot better
(4:15:52) about myself in 10 years cuz I'll be grown up okay yes I think I look better at 31
(4:15:58) better looking at 41 No 41 yeah I'll look I 51 no I'll start what about you
(4:16:07) um I would say yes that I would look better my voice like two years ago was
(4:16:12) really skinny okay so you're 27 right mm so better looking at 37 yeah better looking at 47 um compared to
(4:16:20) 37 no okay and then were you better looking were you better looking at 18 than you are now no better looking at 18
(4:16:28) no better looking better looking now than all right apparently aging does
(4:16:33) nothing to anybody there it's a good question it plays into a to a bigger issue that
(4:16:39) we've got where I think that women tend to give away their more years and and their years of being better looking
(4:16:45) because objectively when women are younger they're better looking in their early 20s when you get into your 30s you start to go downhill and and like that's
(4:16:51) just the reality of things but in today's dating Market we see them giving away their whole entire 20s and being
(4:16:57) like Oh when I'm 35 Prince tring will come along but it just doesn't really tend to happen like that so it's a good
(4:17:03) question I don't think good experiment why how do you think that you don't go downhill you get past 30 you start to
() 
(4:17:10) age dramatically yeah and everyone around you is aging as well when do you think that men find women most physically attractive what what ages
(4:17:17) would you say younger but that's I don't feel like that's right that men view younger women as more beautiful so so
(4:17:25) the statistics are there and they show that men find young women more attractive but you don't feel that's right yeah if you look at statistics for
(4:17:31) women they feel like older men around their age are more attractive too men and women are different so I'm I'm I'm
(4:17:36) specifically refer from a men stance we would be better looking when we're younger different they just from a universal stance don't you think that
(4:17:43) wom when they're more youthful or better looking um no because I feel like women
(4:17:48) become beautiful in the age just to Men to Men yes to me no yeah well yeah I think this is a part
(4:17:56) of the feminist propaganda that women get fed that you age like fine one when it's just really not the case my mom did
(4:18:02) my grandma did they look so good no surgeries no nothing yeah they might have still looked moderately attractive
(4:18:08) when they were older for sure but they still would have been more beautiful when they were younger as preference I do think it's interesting that as women
(4:18:16) we did think I think everyone thought we would look better older and oh I did not oh no you like I I did I think like me
(4:18:23) personally I think that about my own body but I do agree that when you're in your like childbearing years that that
(4:18:29) makes very much sense it's what what physical characteristics do you think will look better when you're 37 um well
(4:18:35) I notice as I get older I get more curvy cuz I used to be very very smaller like I couldn't keep any weight on cuz my met
(4:18:42) metabolism so I just noticed as you think you'll get fatter as you get older oh I know that I'll gain more weight yes
(4:18:47) cuz my met you think that more attractive as you get fatter well I don't want to get fatter I mean my
(4:18:52) you'll be putting on weight so you'll be getting bigger so you think as you put on more weight you think that that will make you more attractive cuz I know I
(4:18:59) gain weight in certain places yes so weight ug your your face will be as as youthful is as it is now no do you think
(4:19:06) that your breasts will be as Supple and will sit the same way of course they won't be exactly the same way I'm not
(4:19:12) very large those things when like your face changing and your breast getting
(4:19:17) more saggy and you getting rounder that makes you more attractive me personally
(4:19:22) to myself yes okay for my standard but I could see that how a man would say I definitely thought you looked better
(4:19:28) when you were 23 sagg saggy boobs and getting bigger is the ideal I mean I
(4:19:34) like getting curves here yeah I think that's beautiful mhm okay then being I
(4:19:40) was a stick you know what I mean so I personally like having hips and larger
(4:19:45) thighs that's the standard for my body yeah you think saggy boobs are more attractive than like I said I'm not
(4:19:52) large chested so I don't there it is my bre I knew it was I knew it was coming
(4:19:57) somebody out there thinks it's beautiful I just like I knew it was coming I knew it was coming hey he likes a large lebia
(4:20:05) maybe they like sagy tits you never know that's true somebody out there thanks it's true okay well I got to let me let
(4:20:12) me just follow up on this it's just an observation I have and I wanted to see what you guys thought so this
(4:20:18) observation on the Aging question is I often see women who are married say no I
(4:20:26) look better now than uh than when I was younger single women though in their 30s
(4:20:33) or 40s or 50s have the exact opposite answer and so I wonder if uh those women
(4:20:38) who are married can just kind of say that because well they're married right and so um they don't really have to play
(4:20:45) in the dating Market anymore they don't have to do any of that right um I just wanted to get your thoughts on that what
(4:20:50) did you think um married versus single no the idea that the married woman will
(4:20:57) give the answer of yeah I did look better or I I I look better now than when I was younger but the single woman
(4:21:04) says well wait I I looked way better younger than I do right now that's the woman in the dating market right M I
(4:21:09) think it really depends on like your security if you're in insecure in your marriage and you feel bad you're going
(4:21:16) to feel yourself as less if you're single you can feel yourself as less but you can feel independent too and feel
(4:21:21) pretty yeah I don't think I don't think that matters if you're married not well maybe not but I just I just wonder what
(4:21:27) you think the motivation is maybe you think the motivation is uh the one is secure hasn't been in the dating market
(4:21:32) for 10 years really easy to make that kind of claim right so just an observation I've seen I think it could
(4:21:38) be different though cuz a woman that's single can feel prettier if she's older because she has so many different options but if a woman that's marri
(4:21:44) those options close yeah exactly but if a woman that's married like you said she could feel like she looks better than what she did but then also it could be a
(4:21:51) different woman that's married feels less because she's only been stuck with and hasn't received love from multiple
(4:21:56) other men think I just think it's cope right I think that they're just like look I can just kind of say that and who
(4:22:02) can challenge it right it's not like I have to go out in the dating market and prove it I'm married exactly right whereas the older the older woman on the
(4:22:09) other hand who's single well she has to prove that [ __ ] right and so of course the first response is well then why are
(4:22:15) you single right if you're so greatl looking now in comparison to your 20s uh
(4:22:20) then why aren't you know why are you still single could be question about character yeah I mean it could be but
(4:22:27) considering that men tend to move towards the physical Beauty standard before they go to any type of Personality just feels like it's kind of
(4:22:33) coping a little bit to me okay that's all it's also an interesting observation about how much women value their beauty
(4:22:40) how much of it they they see it as their main commodity because as they they get older they like desperately clinging on
(4:22:46) to it especially if they're single because they know that they're still in the market whereas a woman who's maybe a little bit more wise and and gets older
(4:22:53) and has kids and her family she realizes that her value is more in being a mother now rather than rather than just being
(4:22:58) hot so it's an interesting observation we'll get right back into
(4:23:03) some topics here but first we got to go to Twitch guys go to twitch.tv/ whatever
(4:23:09) drop us a follow and a prime sub if you have one twitch.tv/ Whatever guys it's

(4:24:13) understand better how to join a conversation and get their points across really really well and concisely kind
(4:24:20) and so I do want to get it back to uh let's see here I suppose piggybacking on
(4:24:27) the you can't be racist towards white people thing perhaps we'll come back to that can you be sexist towards men yes
() 
(4:24:35) sorry starting with you open call I'm ready for it
(4:24:42) actually give me give me a minute give me a minute I want to make sure I word it can you bear sex it's like can we
(4:24:48) sexualize am men yes well I want her to go first so guys like the video like the

(4:24:59) twitch.tv/ whatever also big labia matter also like the video also send in a uh read or at TTS if you are so
(4:25:07) graciously consider helping us out uh let's see all good yeah I
(4:25:15) think I'm going to tie it back to the last conversation and say I think
(4:25:21) syntactically it's the right word how do I I don't I what may maybe contextually
(4:25:27) Tech Trooper donated $200 ladies what do you think are the
(4:25:32) biggest struggles men have right now in the dating environment pivoting right now they G is that a pivot no it comes
(4:25:40) through automatically random listen I think you I think just like you you can't be you can't technically be racist
(4:25:47) towards a white man or sexist towards a man I think it can be insensitive and it
(4:25:52) can be rude and hurtful but I think because because my core belief that
(4:25:58) power dynamics play a lot into how the cultural significance of what something
(4:26:05) means are women a minority maybe not minority numer Ally
(4:26:12) but definitely I wouldn't say we're oppressed but I would say and you can't
(4:26:19) compare struggles why not isn't that the everyone has everyone has their own
(4:26:25) struggles has own struggles well I mean but if you say that there's a power Dynamic right there could have been tons
(4:26:32) of struggle to get to the power Dynamic right so becoming powerful becoming King maybe there was a big struggle there is
(4:26:39) you going to make still the comparison though that this person's more powerful more obstacles for one compared to the
(4:26:44) other and so aren't isn't that a judgment a Jud like it's an assessment
(4:26:50) and so you are comparing maybe so yes um yeah I mean I wouldn't say women are
(4:26:55) oppressed especially when compared to black women um but I would say that they
(4:27:02) definitely have more obstacles than men that doesn't mean men don't have struggles and I think you can say hurtful things that are considered
(4:27:07) sexist to a man but in a a cultural significance they don't compare two two things really quick uh so just
(4:27:13) definitively can you be sexist towards a man I don't think I have a definitive
(4:27:19) answer I think it's a gray area I don't think it is okay I think
(4:27:25) it's a yes or no I disagree okay can I give a hypothetical situation yeah just
(4:27:32) say that there was a little Utopia of women all existing together no men whatsoever a little colony of women and
(4:27:38) then a man walks in and they all Point guns at him and they arrest him they lock him up and they put him in a prison
(4:27:44) and they say this is because you are a man and then every day they walk into his cell they throw feces on him to say
(4:27:50) that's because you're a man would that be sexist yes but that's not the world we live in that's a hypothetical okay
(4:27:56) fine I'll ask this and I do want to credit Andrew for this one a little bit um if if a business that was owned by a
(4:28:03) man didn't want to hire a woman just cuz just cuz she was a woman
(4:28:10) not for some other other reason she wasn't qualified although she was but uh
(4:28:15) would that be sexist if you didn't want to is it sexist for women to cross the street when there's three men coming
(4:28:22) towards her no at night no what because they're men it's not
(4:28:28) sexist but this leads back to my other point I I think yes the man the three men walking down the street can be hurt
(4:28:34) by that and say well why don't why don't you trust me but I think in in the grand scheme of history and culture and power
(4:28:39) dynamics there is a reason why the woman grant that there's a bigger impact on women to for a company to refuse to hire
(4:28:47) them because they're women I'll Grant it but is it still sexist for a company not to hire a woman
(4:28:54) because she's a woman she's a woman yes it's sexist it's sexist so how is it not also sexist for a woman to cross to the
(4:29:02) other side of the street because she has a bias against
(4:29:08) men that they are they are a potential violent threat how is that not sexist
(4:29:14) because like I said before I think in the grand scheme of things culturally there's a different significance hold on
(4:29:19) so I'll grant that there's varying levels of sexism right so for example um
(4:29:24) choosing to kill someone because of their sex you would agree that or well I suppose you would only think it would be
(4:29:30) uh sexist if a man killed a woman because she's a woman but a woman who for who's the one who tried to kill Andy
(4:29:37) Warhol what if it's a black woman who's crossing the street and it's three native Amic American
(4:29:43) men that's actually crazy apeal question that's not a crazy apothecial a black woman says she she sees three Native
(4:29:50) American men walking towards her and she crosses the street I do think that's a crazy hypothetical question because that
(4:29:56) takes into a whole another complex lot of layers that include a lot more cultural significance than yeah so
(4:30:02) what's the answer it depends on actually hold onit wait I got I got this by the way techn Trooper we will come back to
(4:30:08) your TTS but I want to get through this conversation first so we will get into the biggest struggles men have when it comes to dating it's like the oppression
(4:30:14) Olympics but it could be how they're dressed too wait wait so question for you okay perhaps using the sort of
(4:30:20) different scenario is not the best if there was a company that was operated by women and they refused to hire men would
(4:30:27) this be sexist yes wait I thought you can be sexist I thought you can be sexist towards men but Crossing Street
(4:30:34) and taking people to work because then in that case I think
(4:30:42) if there's a whole room of women I think because that's a similar hypothetical question to what you asked if it's all women and then that's it's like well I
(4:30:49) guess also there are there are companies that are the history of power dynamics we have to take in the whole history of
(4:30:55) women and you know as you know women have been far more oppressed than men so if that is the case How could a woman SE
(4:31:04) I do think just like there are Hispanic groups and like black groups four different communities and things that
(4:31:09) where people like like film production companies or like um unions even they they advocate for a specific group of
(4:31:15) people right and so if it is just a group of women and they exclude a man for that reason then sure my grandma's
(4:31:21) in a women's club and they advocate for but that's putting but then you're disregarding the entire history of women
(4:31:26) exactly what do you mean well I have a better question why I can't to speak hang hang why only she's speaking like
(4:31:33) for 30 minutes I'm sorry the attention's not 100% on you right this second but I do think other women should speak and
(4:31:38) they have been I'm just I'm just asking I'm just asking a couple of follow-ups here right I can go back to those like
(4:31:46) no actually she needs a break she shared with me that she needs a break she did take a break is it like two questions
(4:31:52) and then I need a break I'm just curious about about the answer some other girls also wants to I want to hear what they
(4:31:58) have to say too I also want to hear what you have to say so that's why I'm asking you the question listen to other women
(4:32:04) as I know and and we will as soon as I'm done listening to your answer to the question wait didn't you get all butt
(4:32:10) hurt because you had like 30 seconds on the Charlie Kirk thing we're giving you I wasn't butt hurt you weren right so I
(4:32:17) said yes I should have gotten voted off and I did yeah how long by the way how long was the shoot the Jubilee thing
(4:32:24) yeah like two hours two hours okay and you got like one minute of screen time basically yeah because I wasn't logical
(4:32:31) how about I make a deal I'll ask one last question and that's it and then I'll ask like 50 but go ahead okay I I'll ask one last question okay for next
(4:32:39) minutes is it well two it's going to be two but it'll be very fast you agree with me that that you can
(4:32:46) be Prejudice without it being racist meaning if um if like a group of
(4:32:52) black people hate white people because they're white they're not being racist but they're still being
(4:32:58) Prejudice like it's prejudicial right I think I think in being racist or being Prejudice
(4:33:06) but I think you can be Prejudice without being racist racist yeah that makes sense okay so they would be being
(4:33:11) Prejudice in a situation like that for what what was the scenario again if they just hate you cuz you're white yes yeah
(4:33:18) that's Prejudice right can you tell me why morally being Prejudice is better than being
(4:33:24) racist I don't think one's well that's a good question that I don't
(4:33:32) have a specific answer for you should think about that I'll think about that
(4:33:37) just sent two links um all night long so so I'm a little confused because it
(4:33:43) seems like you're leaning towards women cannot be sexist towards men or you just can't be sexist towards men in general
(4:33:50) it sounds like but you did seem to concede that in the example I provided
(4:33:55) that you this scenario I provided that are you well I mean he said he was
(4:34:02) going to ask two questions then we move on yeah he he said that is it is it and
(4:34:07) then you said you were going to ask questions and I said I wasn't going to answer it because I want to hear other women speak it because you just don't want your
(4:34:13) worldview to be challenged because it will crumble under [Music]
(4:34:20) scrutiny I think this it by the way this is um I mean my line of questioning has
(4:34:26) been fairly milk toast and polite but uh I do find it interesting that when you
(4:34:32) get even the slightest degree of perhaps questioning or push back on your worldview you refuse to engage that's
(4:34:38) not been happening this entire time and I've been answering the entire time well you're not really allowing me to
(4:34:44) continue on with the exchange so and I don't think it's fully been
(4:34:51) settled so do you know what stonewalling is do you think it's healthy to do that in a
(4:34:57) relationship what stone what stone okay I'll bring it back to a dating related
(4:35:02) do you think stonewalling in a relationship is toxic answer the question yes yes what the hell is that
(4:35:09) like refusing refusing to address any problems anything that's wrong what
(4:35:15) anything you guys might face as a couple I'm assuming so like if you guys argue if there's something you guys if you guys are like arguing and if you guys
(4:35:21) just choose not to talk about it or if you guys just want to like push it under the rug that's basically what stonewalling is not addressing or wanting to fix the issue I mean you can
(4:35:27) do that if you want to break up like you have to have communication in a relationship El just toxic oh okay it's
(4:35:36) toxic what do you think about that is stonewalling good or bad in a relationship it's a relationship you're
(4:35:42) trying to sustain are we friends right now are we like in a relationship like this is not something that I want to
(4:35:47) this is not grass I want to water right now I want to move on and that's what I'm
(4:35:53) doing then break up you can't really you can't really just be like well I've I've put something out there
(4:36:01) but I'm not prepared to defend it I don't think you can be you're you were essentially saying you can't be racist
(4:36:07) towards white people you can't be sexist towards men I believe that's your position uh you're trying to cloak it in the sort
(4:36:13) of vagueness of well there's black and white but essentially you because you're
() 
(4:36:20) you would say emphatically and definitively you could be racist towards women
(4:36:25) yes racist towards women excuse me I apologize guys I want to make a statement I could not
(4:36:32) handleing that boring questions anymore I'm falling in sleep I'm going home I
(4:36:39) love you all [ __ ] so touch my donated
(4:36:46) $200 wait who show is this are you permitted to run it and ask questions
(4:36:51) yes just like I'm permitted to ignore them I mean you're under no obligation to answer any questions but it sort of
(4:37:00) is super bad faith to not want to engage with the conversation well isn't this a
(4:37:08) group discussion for a reason though to hear other perspectives and I've been talking for the past what like hour can other do other women do you guys want to
(4:37:14) say anything you know maybe if you kind of just answer the questions I'd be able maybe if you just answer the questions
(4:37:19) going against you they're asking you questions that's why we can't speak right now because they're asking you not us they're not directed towards us like
(4:37:25) I would we've I think they're just trying to like hear like the reasoning as to the statements that have been made I just feel like I've been I've been
(4:37:31) trying to explain my okay then let's let's do it let's keep going like are you just kind of trying to we ask direct
(4:37:38) question let's just keep keep going then you're never going to win this just ask question for direct
(4:37:45) answer okay so trying to recall where where we were so can you or can you not
(4:37:52) be sexist towards men said this no okay can you or can you
(4:38:02) not be racist towards white people no okay um that doesn't mean I'm so I guess
() 
(4:38:10) where I'm confused though is you in the scenario I provided where a woman a
(4:38:15) company and perhaps the owners of the company were was a woman or a group of
(4:38:21) women and they refused to hire men because they're men you did seem to concede that that would be sexist and
(4:38:28) then I changed my mind oh so it's it wouldn't be sexist it would be what well I know I think it depends on
(4:38:34) the context like I said before if it's a if it's a group for women to advocate for women with then yes you can exclude
(4:38:41) anyone who is not a woman but if it's a group like where there are a mix of some but
(4:38:48) maybe the majority are women and you're excluding a Man based on the grounds that he's a man then yes you're being
(4:38:53) prejudiced towards a man sexist Prejudice sexist okay okay
(4:39:00) well but the exact same scenario but it's being done to woman
(4:39:06) women would be Prejudice or sexist sexist so is your definition of sexism
(4:39:14) Prejudice plus power yes and you're saying men hold the power women don't
(4:39:21) yes okay and so wouldn't it be the case that let's
(4:39:26) say I'm a j I'm uh I'm a male and I'm from the I came
(4:39:34) out of poverty and I'm going to be I'm applying to be a janitor at a woman's company and the board is made up
(4:39:40) predominant of women the owner is a woman she's a billionaire and I'm applying for a $30,000 a year job at
(4:39:48) this company she's a billionaire mind you um touch my blade donated
(4:39:54) $200 the young lady's arguments are very flawed and that is why she almost broke
(4:39:59) down and needed a break for very basic questions just take the L as everyone else sees the L you already took okay
(4:40:08) thank you thank you touch my blade in the scenario the the former formerly
(4:40:14) impoverished janitorial worker uh applying for a company that's predominantly owned by women uh the
(4:40:21) owner of the the company's a she's a female building there uh she refuses to
(4:40:26) hire this male janitor because he's male is this sexist Prejudice hold on who
(4:40:34) holds the power she Wasing yes his J I'm saying in
(4:40:40) the grand scheme of things no no no no no it's not in the grand scheme of things it's a specific example a world
(4:40:46) of doesn't in a world where woman's a billionaire where the one woman is a
(4:40:52) billionaire in a world full of men that hold power okay you have to look at the
(4:40:57) context of things you can't just look at one hypothetical situation so does she not have power she does so she has power
(4:41:04) plus Prejudice equals racism you conceited she has power hold
(4:41:10) on do you conceed she has power yes do you concede that she's Prejudice yes it
(4:41:16) meets your own definition of racism in the grand scheme of things oh wow okay
(4:41:21) now what is it Shifting the goalpost here a little bit I thought it was just Prejudice plus
(4:41:27) power power in the grand scheme of things sorry I didn't clarify that this
(4:41:33) is even a new definition this is another this is Super Saiyan level three no I just didn't clarify earlier because that
(4:41:38) wasn't asked I've never even heard that this is new this is new be taken into context and the
(4:41:45) historical significance of things need to be considered many times yeah I have two many times am I bro I'm I'm a little
(4:41:54) confused man you you bamboozled me with this one hold on in the grand scheme of things wait let's pull up the two uh
(4:42:00) images I sent you Austin they're both the same link oh wait really hold on does anyone have the time hold on what
(4:42:07) time is it I'll send you ah there it is okay milk to push back uh all right so
(4:42:14) just power through for another hour I'm going to sorry I'm let me try this one okay that should be another one can you
(4:42:20) get the other one that should be a different one oh can one of you guys take your seat uh Ana can you take the
(4:42:27) seat spent $1,000 to come here what's that said I spent like
(4:42:33) $1,000 to come here and you're sitting there just talking to her without talking to other people and we've been
(4:42:39) talking to everybody we've been talking to everybody spent 30 minutes on you sorry that with your Tik Tock brain you
(4:42:45) haven't received the appropriate amount of attention that would keep you adequately entertained she's sitting
(4:42:51) here saying that you guys are talking to her too much and that she wants she's trying to weasel out of the argument no
(4:42:56) I'm confident in my stance and I said we can keep going but I I think the whole
() 
(4:43:02) point of a group debate is to hear everyone's perspectives and it's just turned into this oneon-one well we'll pull up these images and then I'll get
(4:43:08) right to you so I don't care if you talk to me the world according to a feminist oppressed just just curious do you agree
(4:43:15) so the women over there who are probably upper middle class or whatever uh are they oppressed and the the homeless male
(4:43:23) is he he's privileged how's it dumb the majority of men are homeless is that
(4:43:29) dumb that's like a whole different layer homelessness that's like a whole another yeah that's most more men exper so this
(4:43:36) was the argument I was going to make earlier so you said it's not a compar game between men and women actually that
(4:43:43) is the Genesis of feminism women have it worse in comparison to men but my actual
(4:43:49) counter is is that not only today but even historically men have been more
(4:43:54) oppressed than women and men have had it worse historically compared to women is that why more men are in government than
(4:44:02) women and get to make the decisions about what happens Apex fallacy that's very cool so we can talk about you know
(4:44:10) the small proportion of men who occupy these sort of higher positions of power
(4:44:17) and who perhaps have some better life outcomes although I would argue the vast majority of men have worse life outcomes
(4:44:24) on average than women why well they die earlier that's
(4:44:30) one um but but but not only that's just like natural I mean like how is that and
(4:44:38) all the victims of war are men the ones who D in war only men were being drafted women were in well I mean if we were just going to
(4:44:44) go move off of what's natural that's child birth too child birth is natural and now used to be one of the number one
(4:44:50) killers of women and it seems like we've unnaturally extended their lives
(4:44:55) right so I mean um I wouldn't I I wouldn't appeal to Nature like I understand what you're saying I get it I
(4:45:01) would just I my my rebuttal to this is just always simple it's like I just reject your definition of what is racism
(4:45:07) and sexism I don't think I think those are the grounds we disagree on I don't think there's coming common ground for that yeah I don't think that prejudice
(4:45:14) plus power means anything it's just like this kind of um bizarre uh in or
(4:45:19) non-introspective but historical perspective but only from standpoint which is the theory that you learned
(4:45:26) right standpoint this is from the stand of women the point of view from women and that's where intersectionality comes
(4:45:32) from and it's like just rejected I just don't think that uh I think if if if I claim that um racism is you just don't
(4:45:39) like a person based on the color their skin you could never give me a reason why that wasn't valid other than you just didn't like that reason right yeah
(4:45:45) no I just think we we disagree on the foundational grounds of where the argument would even go can you guys close the doors by the way
(4:45:52) um so I'm I'm actually curious to hear and
(4:45:57) you know if the other panelists want to weigh in uh can any of you name a
(4:46:02) greater gender grievance than uh well actually first I need to ask a couple
(4:46:07) questions what percentage of uh military casual um what's the gender breakdown
(4:46:15) there well mainly men I mainly 99
(4:46:20) historically I don't know the number but hi so can any of you name a bigger
(4:46:27) gendered grievance than forced military conscription um forced sex work in third
(4:46:34) world countries forced sex work in forced marriage for children so do okay
(4:46:41) so how many PE do you think do you think there's more women who have been involved in forced sex work than there
(4:46:48) have hold on then there have been men who have been essentially and it's not
(4:46:53) even just conscription it's the gendered expectation on men that men ought to be
(4:46:58) the Protectors of Nations now I don't necessarily object to this but we can't ignore the fact that this is a gendered
(4:47:04) expectation so even men who volunteer for the military there is some degree of
(4:47:10) uh uh Force there that's being applied but and why is that why is that yeah who
(4:47:16) decided that more men were going to fight than women a tiny strata of powerful people so repeat that sorry a
(4:47:23) tiny strata of powerful people wait so just to be clear so what how many women do you think have been in forced into
(4:47:30) sex work well there sex traffi do you think it's more than the amount of men that
(4:47:36) have been forced into a military role no no but who forced them into that role right right okay that's not that doesn't
(4:47:43) really even address the argument it does it's directly addressing the argument nope you're saying that men forced them
(4:47:48) into it you're saying but the men by men a System created well what if I told you
(4:47:54) that uh women leaders women monarchs women
(4:47:59) Queens more likely to engage in Warfare than their male
(4:48:06) counterparts repeat it male queens were more likely to wage war excuse me female
(4:48:12) Queen queens were more likely and well met LOL paladins donated $200
(4:48:18) and2 Brian when will you learn the definition of sexism is actually man bad
(4:48:24) woman good the definition of racism is white bad Brown good black best PS Love
(4:48:29) Line figured out Callins 30 years ago even if it first off it's not clear
(4:48:37) to me if if it's men or people with power or the elite that made that we that made
(4:48:44) it well you're saying okay all those men that had to go the war well who was it even if it was men is it because they're
(4:48:50) men or because they had power the men in power made it so that men would go to war because they saw but there there's
(4:48:57) been Queens who have had power so is it because they're men or is it because they have power because that's the social Norm what percentage of men have
(4:49:04) power I don't know what percentage of men throughout history had the power to
(4:49:12) send other men to War I don't know them I don't know it's a very small amount
(4:49:18) though right M yeah okay so does it have more to do with people who hold power or
(4:49:24) the fact that they're meant power people that hold power because they they view men as stronger so they're going to send
(4:49:30) men into war say women are too weak to fight more men are going to die this would defeat your claim but of your sort
(4:49:36) of fallacious rebuttal to well I'm going to disregard your claims about well here
(4:49:42) are how men are more oppressed by just sort of diverting to living under cated
(4:49:49) $200 C Andrew wins just BC he's hot Brian only wins BC he water boards
(4:49:57) sexism sounds worse than Prejudice but it's the same thing they want to be the only ones who can use the term against
(4:50:04) men uh living thank you for the TTS man appreciate it okay so uh it's a very small proportion of
(4:50:13) people who've had power throughout history the people in power are the ones who tend to dictate whether someone goes
(4:50:18) to war or not whether there is war or not it's not like throughout history it's not like it's been voted on by the
(4:50:25) populace it's just you have a dictator a lord a leeg lord whatever it is a king a monarch saying okay uh we're going to go
(4:50:32) to war with this country blah blah blah so it's not because they're men it's because they have power now go going
() 
(4:50:40) back to my thing I still haven't heard an answer to name a gender grievance greater than uh forced military
(4:50:49) conscription forced marriage not I don't think that that's a greater grievance
(4:50:55) than forced military conscription you know I even um kind of
(4:51:01) on the idea that I would just kind of Grant it again okay sure you know men
(4:51:06) men they're the ones who can script other men right and make them go out and fight Wars but kind of even if that's true um
(4:51:15) so what right ultimately wouldn't the grievance that men would have still be
(4:51:20) similar to the same type of Oppression that women are claiming men give to them right yes it is a griev still a majority
(4:51:26) of men think they're don't think women are suited for war well they're not what
(4:51:31) they're not no no no so you can't complain about a grievance that you're okay with and also compared to another
(4:51:37) one what's great sex trafficking Maybe not maybe num hang on hang on that's weird that's weird hang on wait just to
(4:51:43) be I just want to do one claim at a time that's all and I'm willing to getor yeah I'm willing to get to the sex trafficking by the way talk to these
(4:51:49) other girls but also let me input but but but the thing is is like no that was my bad no you're good you're
(4:51:55) good I just I just want to answer to to the first claim right um you're you were
(4:52:01) talking about uh the system that you agree with right well I may not agree with uh with the government going to war
(4:52:08) with another Nation right but I would still have to agree to conscript or else I don't have any rights but you agree
(4:52:13) hang H hang on otherwise I don't have rights I don't have the right to own a God I don't have the right to vote all
(4:52:20) those rights go away the second I don't sign up for the draft and uh historically this has been the case
(4:52:25) where if men don't swear falty to a lord or things like that they can't have own land they can't live on the land they
(4:52:31) can't even be a part of the nation right no such fty Oaths have been required traditionally of women just because you
(4:52:38) say well you're the only ones who have the capacity to do the thing doesn't mean it's not an impression that you are
(4:52:44) forced to do the thing only because you're the one with the capacity that's absurd right so I I really don't I don't
(4:52:51) really understand why even if it were true that it's men who are forcing men to do this that if women's grievance is
(4:52:57) against men right then wouldn't that wouldn't that negate their grievance right because we' say okay well men are
(4:53:03) just oppressive to men is they are to women then it is a real grievance I don't think that this grievance is not
(4:53:10) mhm accepted it's very real it's very sad yeah so but so then I don't really
(4:53:16) understand the push back of um but don't you think that men are the ones who can fight yeah I do I think that that men
(4:53:23) are much better equipped to fight in Warfare than women don't you um I think it depends really I feel like women can
(4:53:29) help in other ways they can help with like yeah the fighting part fighting well there's doctors in the war there's
(4:53:35) so much to it what what are they what are they what are they fighting with an infection they're helping
(4:53:41) W helping wounds they they're still putting their lives at risk they're in Risk too sa these people but the the
(4:53:46) doctors who are on the field getting shot at in the field are
(4:53:51) men right I mean that's a combat medic right there men are going to be better suited for that than women aren't
(4:53:59) they yeah and I guess yes like let me ask it a different way okay when you're
(4:54:05) walking down the street and you just see people lifting up heavy [ __ ] off the ground okay do you see
(4:54:10) touch my blade donated $200 wait so men in the majority of
(4:54:16) power men in ultimate power voted out SL the voted for women to vote so all of
(4:54:22) the rights you have were voted in by the very oppressors you have issue with it's well that's a it's kind of an
(4:54:29) interesting point but I think we can kind of sidestep it for a second just kind of figure this out right thank you
(4:54:34) BL when you're just walking down the street and just Things You observe around you the people who lift the heaviest amount of [ __ ] are men or women
(4:54:41) typically men yes why cuz they're biologically stronger much stronger right but some women are can be strong
(4:54:46) too I don't disagree there are some strong very strong women I have no doubt that there are many women on this planet
(4:54:52) who are much much stronger than me are they not capable to fight in War I don't think that uh ultimately we would want
(4:54:58) to create a policy around trying to find really strong women to fight our Wars because we're just not going to find
(4:55:04) very many of them right well I don't think we need to find strong women any women can still help yeah they're not going to be on combat but they could still help yeah yeah but takes less men
(4:55:11) out of being drafted yeah yeah sure but even then even if we were to draft based along that you're in a support role okay
(4:55:18) you're still not in a combat role so where do you die you die in the combat right you don't die making the MREs you
(4:55:24) die in the field trying to get to the m right so the question ultimately becomes
(4:55:30) if you have the sex with the capacity to do this meaning the other army is all men would you rather have an all male
(4:55:37) Army to oppose them um you're you're you're a general now
(4:55:42) right like you're in charge of the entire United States armed forces the enemy has is out outnumbers you and it's
(4:55:48) all men would you prefer to have an all male Army to oppose them I think it depends on the physical capability if
(4:55:55) women are physically capable with the men or if men are not capable enough they're too skinny they're not strong enough to fight some men wouldn't be
(4:56:01) capable yeah but on average don't you think that men would be much stronger more equipped to do this yes yeah they I
(4:56:07) mean they just can right they can carry way more gear they can load the tanks back they can they can do all of this stuff better because they're physically
(4:56:13) stronger so obviously if your job is to kill other human beings you're going to
(4:56:18) try to move towards the sex which is much stronger right like that just kind of tracks doesn't it I feel like you
(4:56:24) should move who has strength not the sex just strength in general yeah but but here's men but here's the thing even if
(4:56:30) that's true and we find every single woman who can go on par with men necessarily through her idea of
(4:56:37) intersectionality it would still be men doing the Lion Share of this fighting there's no way around that right so like
(4:56:43) even if we found all of the the women who like can fight just as good as the men can on the front line necessarily
(4:56:49) it's going to be far less of them right yes so it' still be men who would be impressed in that position right M so if
(4:56:55) that is the case right and this grievance is there because the capacity is only there for men to really be able
(4:57:02) to do this you would not want to make policy around trying to find just like drafting it what a waste resource it
(4:57:08) would be to like get 1,000 women in for three potential candidates who could be soers skills they can do other things
(4:57:14) though yeah but but they're not battling right that's the problem's not only battle there's so much that goes into
(4:57:20) war but the big part right the part that you need yeah is the guys in the field with the bullets right you need that
(4:57:26) that's there's that's not negotiable right it can be men making the MREs or women making the MREs but it really
(4:57:33) isn't going to be women who are going to be doing the actual fighting right so would you feel more safe like
(4:57:39) let's say would you feel like you're going to win a war if it's like let's say your group is women fighting against men would you feel safer behind the
(4:57:45) women against the men or would you feel safer against the men against men are they Sharp Shooters if they got they're
(4:57:50) good with their guns women or men if they're good with their guns I'd feel safe either way well which which sex do
(4:57:56) you think would be better at that just on average guns shooting women or men men
(4:58:03) yeah men because it's been men shooting for majority of the time women haven't been in these roles because these roles
(4:58:09) right just cuz they're stronger aim guns are heavy yeah guns are really heavy and
(4:58:14) by the way when you aim you're holding the gun up M right very heavy gun and you're holding it up for a long long
(4:58:21) period of time well you're trained so I mean yeah but but but you have to train
(4:58:26) there has to be the capacity to be trained so that that capacity is going to have X amount of like muscle mass
(4:58:31) right and so like this is what we see when we look at police departments and things like this when they try to bring women in they have to lower the standard
(4:58:38) so that women can meet the standard m they're not raising the standard right they lower it so that women can then do
(4:58:44) the job so the the ultimate question just kind of becomes if that is the case
(4:58:49) it's always going to be optimal to have men in the military at least in the majority to do the fighting portion of that right so so if that is the case
(4:58:57) then again men are going to have that grievance okay and so how does that get balanced how does that get like how does
(4:59:03) that grievance get balanced that because men necessarily are the ones who must do that because they're the only ones who
(4:59:09) can do that and even if some women can do that and even do that with the men it's still mostly going to get men or be
(4:59:15) men who do do that what special thing do they get like what special things should we give them that only they have some
(4:59:23) yeah yeah wait I don't understand the men who are who are doing all of this fighting and whatnot yeah what like what
(4:59:30) special cookie do they get are they now an oppressed
(4:59:37) class they get benefits after War so with the women that's true I they're
(4:59:42) just respected more respect respected so with the women exactly so what special
(4:59:49) thing does this one intersectional group get that necessarily has all of its power stripped what power the oh like
(4:59:58) they are most of the people in government who make rules are fighting on the front lines of
(5:00:04) Wars the men yes yeah that's okay so wait wait that's what they get that's they get to control where this country
(5:00:10) go so just just so I get this right are you striving for a nation where women
(5:00:15) have at least 50% of the power to men yeah well then that negates this
(5:00:21) entire argument because you would still have this intersectional grievance here of men who are on the front lines
(5:00:27) battling and we don't have inter hang hang on hang on hang on one argument at a time right you would still have this
(5:00:32) intersectional grievance of all of these men who only have the capacity to do this where women do not have the
(5:00:38) capacity to do this and even if we to find all the ones that did it would still mostly be men you saying now we
(5:00:44) have a split power Dynamic 50% women 50% men in government what's the special
(5:00:49) thing you're going to do to offset that for men why why does there have to be a special thing after great why does there have to be what I'm sorry does there
() 
(5:00:55) need to be affirmative actiones like a sticker for fighting what is affirmative action isn't that to
(5:01:01) correct grievances in intersections that are repressed historically yes okay well then that's
(5:01:08) exactly what I'm asking for for the draft I'm asking for an intersection for a grievance that historically have only
(5:01:14) affected men right and that's why mostly men are in government and they but you're striving to take them mostly out
(5:01:21) of government or only equalize power so if that's the case you you're not okay I see okay I see what you're okay I see
(5:01:27) what you're arguing that makes sense that does make sense um yeah I mean I just think I I think I go back to why do
(5:01:34) men need a sticker for fighting why do do that's if if that's their only option ifen can't fight then why then why if
(5:01:43) that's the only option should they get awarded for something that only they can do like if I don't know I just that's
(5:01:48) well wait a second so is this like communism like from each according to
(5:01:53) their according to what they can do where there shouldn't even be War so I feel like I'm the bad person to talk yeah I mean not really though right I I
(5:02:01) I I I would just agree when is there an award for grievances what is affirmative
(5:02:06) action um Define it that would be uh giving uh special hiring treatment or
(5:02:12) things like this to people of color because they have historically been oppressed well it's more like balancing
(5:02:19) the playing grounds because that's well then how tell me how you balance the playing grounds for now we have this
(5:02:24) entire group of men and they they're the only ones have the capacity to do the one thing we need more than anything
(5:02:30) else which is National Security National Defense should be mostly in government then well I'm asking you how you make
(5:02:36) this offset for intersectionality I don't know I don't have a solution for that because because because women don't
(5:02:42) ever think about the fact that there is a historic oppression towards men that only men have ever
(5:02:47) bore right well I'm asking you I'm like I'm giving you your opportunity to tell me why that's not true and you're just
(5:02:53) kind of like well it is true I just don't give a [ __ ] right it's like I it's yeah it's true I just don't care because
(5:02:59) they can and so I'm like but that goes against this entire idea of intersectionality no I just think I mean
(5:03:04) I'm coming from a place where I don't think War should even oh okay well hang on but then I'm
(5:03:10) I'm coming from a place where all of us should just be one race and and all of us should just be one sex y if all of us were just one
(5:03:17) race and one sex we would never have any of these and all of us should be the exact same strength the exact same height the exact same eye color exact
(5:03:24) same everything then we just don't have to worry touch my blade donated $200 does she understand what a draft is
(5:03:31) luk war my C she understands fine she she's contending with the idea and I think that that's fine you contend with
(5:03:36) the idea she not being disrespectful not being disrespectful background a nice conversation but I would I would
(5:03:41) genuinely enjoy kind of getting your your perspective on that right um I
(5:03:47) don't actually understand how this grievance from in from the intersectionality standpoint is actually
(5:03:53) ever addressed if you if you're striving to equalize uh the Sexes when it comes to
(5:03:58) government every other grievance from every other group which has been historically uh oppressed including
(5:04:05) women as a monolith by your logic still needs to be offset but for some reason
(5:04:10) men don't get those same benefits and I don't actually understand
(5:04:16) why yeah I really I just that's my question right it's like
(5:04:21) why shouldn't they get so shouldn't they get some kind of like intersectional I don't know reward of
(5:04:27) some sort sure I just can't give you an answer I think that's something that's been that's where we're at as a country
(5:04:34) I think trying to figure out a balance of those intersectionalities so I I can't really give a solution for what
(5:04:39) the country should do to balance that out M but I agree that it should be balanced out somehow somehow somehow and
(5:04:46) I don't have an answer for you for that do you
(5:04:57) uh are you getting up
() 
(5:05:02) okay uh do you think women should be drafted
(5:05:12) yes I I think yes but I also agree with your guys's point that men are just
(5:05:20) biologically stronger and I don't think it would benefit much but it does level
(5:05:25) out well it would beity it's a form of I yes and that's why I think they should be drafted I think they should be
(5:05:31) drafted yeah okay you're in favor of yes forced con uh conscription for women
(5:05:36) they should be if more yes I mean well well so there's The Selective Service as men we have to register if we want to be
(5:05:43) able if if we as men want to be able to vote if we want to get certain federal student loans if we want certain federal
(5:05:49) jobs if we don't want uh there's a I believe it's a misdemeanor you can be
(5:05:55) fined uh $250,000 if you don't register for the Selective Service um and actually they recently passed this where
(5:06:01) I think it just becomes automatic but women are barred from having to uh
(5:06:06) register with a selective service and they would in some wartime scenario they
(5:06:13) would be barred from having to be drafted so you're in favor just well I don't think anyone should have to be
(5:06:18) drafted but if since it is a thing yes I think everyone should have to be drafted
(5:06:23) I mean why would it be just one okay group I suppose that's fair um let's see
(5:06:29) we did have a message that we were going to allow to come in uh it
(5:06:36) was um H we'll come back to some of this stuff but I'll let this one techn
(5:06:43) Trooper donated $200 ladies what do you think are the biggest struggles men have right now in
(5:06:50) the dating environment starting with you do you have anything um could you come back to
(5:06:56) me come back to me for a second anything anything anything
(5:07:02) anything uh I think um the burden of being expected to pay on dates
(5:07:10) like people would be like oh he doesn't pay um he's not worth it I feel like I don't feel I feel like that's bad oh
(5:07:16) that's a good one like who pays or whatever yeah mhm uh also really quick before we get wait who
(5:07:23) pays I didn't really hear an answer though I know we kind we divert a little bit is there a greater gender grievance
(5:07:30) than forced military conscription or men's Duty when it comes to Warfare throughout history is there a
(5:07:36) bigger gender grievance that any of you can state is it sorry are you asking like is there
(5:07:43) anything that men suffer from more than women suffer more than men um no I think
(5:07:51) I mean men have the highest unal living rates of themselves I'm asking I'm asking if there's a greater female
(5:07:57) gender grievance than men's involvement in
() 
(5:08:03) Warfare throughout history I don't think so sex trafficking not worse there I
(5:08:09) feel like there are more sex trafficking bad sex trafficking bad not nearly as
(5:08:15) bad as Warfare I feel like Warfare is the worst I do think but I feel like
(5:08:21) there are more grievances towards women there is that extreme gri on you I'll even double down on this think different
(5:08:26) Warfare Warfare on its own excluding all the other grievances men have for
(5:08:31) example greater light there's a greater workplace fatalities greater homelessness greater uh self deletion
(5:08:39) rates all kinds of stuff Warfare what's that nothing go ahead say it no thank
(5:08:45) you okay so just looking at Warfare alone I think it is actually if you
(5:08:53) combine all of women's grievances it doesn't even compare to the sole male
(5:08:58) grievance when it comes to Mal's involvement in Warfare have you ever been to work do you know how how would
(5:09:04) that be relevant because like have you ever been sex trafficked no but shut
(5:09:10) up no but I've been like sexually assault you have you been sex trafficked it's the same when you get
(5:09:17) sex traffic you technically get Ed cuz you what can happen when you're sex traffic were you have you been sex
(5:09:22) trafficked no trafficked no okay so I have not been to war but that doesn't mean that I don't I have fac you know
(5:09:30) how then you can't say like what mean war is one of the most document you're not a guy in war like I can't even say
(5:09:36) that the same thing the different this doesn't even make any sense what if he had then he can and then he can state
(5:09:42) that opinion that it's worse than the other thing ask bring up a guy that's been in a war have youever had AB traff
(5:09:48) have you ever had an abortion no you can't have an opinion on
(5:09:53) abortion then yes I can no you've never had I haven't had like forced abortion
(5:09:59) you've what and like like purposely I'm sorry what like a miscarriage you mean
(5:10:04) or something like that well I don't even want to get into the details but I think I think actually uh Brian's argument
(5:10:10) here is pretty good so the the idea here is just this the idea is just
(5:10:16) um if you say right men men can do this
(5:10:22) so they should who can have kids it's women does that mean they
(5:10:29) should no no so so then if men can fight
(5:10:35) the wars then they should also doesn't make much sense un fight War I I I just
(5:10:41) I don't feel like it only should be men yeah but it but but but let's let us
(5:10:46) assume for a seconds not okay okay and that women also go to the front lines and they do battle okay you still are
(5:10:53) going to have to concede that it's still majority of it going to be men just like in the police department things like
(5:10:58) that still because they have the necessary Force application right so so if that's true then we're still kind of
(5:11:05) back to the idea that it's still mostly going to be men no matter what and if
(5:11:10) they should do it because they're the only ones who can do it then why wouldn't you apply that same logic to
(5:11:15) well if women are the only ones who can have babies then they should have
(5:11:20) babies this this doesn't this is like so well why should men fight in Wars for their
(5:11:26) Nation they're forced to well if they were not forced to we would still need
(5:11:31) them to why should they should they if we need them yes I feel like everyone
(5:11:37) should find War if we need people to find War yeah I know but but can can
(5:11:42) women effectively fight in these wars like men can I feel like if they were in war and more technology could be
(5:11:48) Advanced if we were in it more like there's so there's not we we don't have a position there if we had more time in
(5:11:55) there I feel like we could develop and find our own use in war women can yeah
() 
(5:12:00) but what about the fighting part they probably could fight too you think that women could fight yes so let me ask you a question okay do you think if you had
(5:12:07) a foreign Nation with an all female milit yes the same technology as an all male military same technology same
(5:12:13) technology makes a difference same technology okay and they went to battle with each other yes you think that it
(5:12:18) would be equal no why stronger men yeah so the force applicator right it's like
(5:12:24) no matter what we're just always going to kind of come back to men kind of have to do that fighting part more than women
(5:12:30) right like I don't I don't see a way around it by your and that's your own logic right even if they're equally
(5:12:36) technologically advanced you know what I mean it's still yeah not not going to not going to work right it's still going
(5:12:42) to be men who are the majority in these wars so are they the only ones really who can do
(5:12:48) that for now yes maybe the future things will be so should they do that because they can do
(5:12:55) that should they find War if needed mhm if they're D yes okay well then if that
(5:13:01) is the case if we need more people should women have babies we don't need
(5:13:07) more people if we did if they did if we did if we did maybe I
(5:13:13) don't know wait maybe like maybe they should be should they this is not a real they forced to have children this is not
(5:13:19) a real situation it is right now do you know what the birth rate is no in the west it's below replacement we actually
(5:13:25) need more babies we need them like that's not even not even negotiable that we need them right so I I I see you want
(5:13:33) to jump in I'm happy to let you right uh just a second I'm almost done with this so uh yeah we do we do need them but
(5:13:40) let's just assume for a second because she's going to be like but the UN project and then we'll get into that in a second but um let us assume for a
(5:13:48) second just just hypothetically purely hypothetically that you took a country like South Korea where the birth rate's
(5:13:53) below one yeah one it's below one that's not sustainable that's like
(5:14:00) culture doomed right culture other areas with high population and restrictions on
(5:14:05) yeah I get it I get it but but if the the people group itself the nation wants to survive the government says we need
(5:14:12) more children should the women oblige I don't think so you don't think so right
(5:14:17) but but men should oblige to fight for the nation it's kind of an odd standard go ahead go ahead so you're arguing for
(5:14:24) a handmaid tail situation you think that if the birth R's plummeting women I'm sorry what argument did I make hang on
(5:14:30) hang on what argument did I make well so you're basically comparing War to birth rates and saying if men are forced to
(5:14:36) fight Wars because only they can then women should be forced to have give birth because only they can nope I'm
(5:14:42) utilizing your standard not my own I haven't given an argument or position of what I even think on it what do you
(5:14:48) think I'm just utilizing the position you have the position of should so men should fight this because they're the
(5:14:54) ones who can fight this I don't think okay anyone should be forced to fight nobody should be nobody should I don't
(5:15:00) think anyone should be forced to do anything so if the nation right is being um in some way there's a preparation for
(5:15:07) an invasion on the United States you don't think that the your government should be able to compel anybody to go
(5:15:12) fight in a war no not if they not if they don't want to I don't think anyone should be like yes then maybe the country will die and that's I'm and the
(5:15:19) women are I'm just saying no one like I don't think because if you are going to compare War to birth and you're saying
(5:15:26) only one group can do something then they should I don't think anyone should have to do anything that's fine I just
(5:15:34) want to make sure let me let me wrap this real quick I just want to make sure I got this right if the country is being
(5:15:39) threatened by foreign enemies right and it put in a compulsory draft because it
(5:15:45) needed to defend itself very quickly from these enemies you're going to get a few weeks of training and then right to the front line because you have to
(5:15:50) defend your nation right otherwise there ain't going to be a nation to defend um you don't think that men should feel the
(5:15:57) obligation to go do that they should feel the obligation okay but but I don't I don't
(5:16:02) think that means they should be forced to go into war and okay maybe let's say so okay okay hang on I just want to make
(5:16:08) sure I got it clear I think I understand what you're saying if they want to volunteer to go sure but if they don't want to volunteer now let's say the
(5:16:15) government needs oh I don't know 20 million soldiers that's going to be far and a
(5:16:21) way outpaced uh the need from the amount of people who would actually go into
(5:16:28) service right they need 20 million so it's like an outrageously large military force 20 20 million just like one branch
(5:16:35) right uh they needed those conscripts and there's not enough people volunteering what would your solution to
(5:16:42) that be well do you think they should be forced to go so then if you're comparing
(5:16:47) War to birth and you think someone who can hang on hang on well can I finish my question didn't answer mine before you
(5:16:53) asked one I'd like you to answer mine and then ask yours so my question to you specifically was why do you think that
(5:17:02) if the government needed 20 million soldiers to fight in a war when the nation was under threat that they should
(5:17:07) be able to draft those
(5:17:17) soldiers no no because I'm coming from a stance of and so the entailment of this
(5:17:23) is the country totally destroyed well because then I'm comparing it to if
(5:17:29) things are equal between genders MH then if the birth rate is plummeting I also
(5:17:34) do not believe that women should be forced to give birth right you don't like the entailment of the the position I understand that but I think you should
(5:17:41) feel obligated as a human country to do your but wait there's a second entailment here actually there's two
(5:17:46) more so the second entailment here also is that damn it touch my blade donated
(5:17:52) $200 should let an invasion happen maybe by a nation that doesn't have the same
(5:17:57) values think of one a bad one if men don't want to fight cool now you have
(5:18:04) new Masters which would you prefer new or right well this moves into this entailment so the second entailment is
(5:18:10) okay another Nation goes okay we need 20 million soldiers and we're going to force you [ __ ] to fight over here we
(5:18:18) need them we can't force our men to fight under your like bizarre guidelines of you know it can only be it can only
(5:18:25) be based around the fact that you want to go and blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah who has the advantage here the other country the other country
(5:18:31) right so you've necessarily push your nation at a huge disadvantage to the other nations which are around them to
(5:18:37) be conquered right how how would people like us not see that as subversion like as actual subversion to
(5:18:44) the nation if the idea is we can't even equi and and defend ourselves properly
(5:18:50) because the entailment of that is like you might have some additional duties right like it's totally but that's the
(5:18:57) second but then we have the third entail Mage the one that you don't like which is well wait if we could compel men to
(5:19:04) do that then we could compel women to have children if we needed to to right
(5:19:09) that's the entailment you don't like right yeah I what's compel versus Force cuz I think as a as a country you should
(5:19:16) you should persuade and encourage women be drafted to have babies if we need them finish my sentence well I'm clarifying you ask was trying to finish
(5:19:23) wait you asked the question yeah I'm sorry you asked me the you asked me the question like five statements ago and I
(5:19:29) was speaking and finishing my sentence yeah yeah I'm sorry I thought you asked for the clarification you said what does
(5:19:34) this mean so I was just telling you okay oh I see okay the question yeah
(5:19:40) um what was what was yeah so I was just saying the entailment of women giving birth right should women be drafted to
(5:19:46) give birth if we need it no right why because then I I I Envision handmaid's tail and that's just that's like I don't
(5:19:52) know I that's just a whole that's not even a democracy that's not Freedom that's not Equity so then the draft
(5:19:57) isn't either well I I don't agree with the draft I don't think it I don't think anyone should be forced to but then the entailment of that is you give all of
(5:20:02) your enemies hug Advantage country should encourage their citizens to fight if they need to I think they should encourage their women to give birth if
(5:20:09) they need to but I don't think by any means they should force them to do so so okay so if a country didn't force women
(5:20:17) to give birth like conscript them to give birth like they do conscript men to get into a draft okay would you be okay
(5:20:23) with propaganda that would increase the birth rate like don't have an abortion
(5:20:28) abortions are bad stop having abortions they're terrible like today or
(5:20:34) even I don't putting in LW that limited the amount of abortions
(5:20:40) one could have like would that be okay I think um CU that's a good question I
(5:20:45) think those are steps that lead to the extreme eventually I I do think certain
(5:20:51) values should be encouraged but I don't think that should come at the cost of certain freedoms and Liberties yeah
(5:20:58) right I get it so but just so you know the kind of the entailments of these positions then is that if if there can't
(5:21:04) be any compulsion to do what the nation needs via draft of men because it has to be volunteer because you're afraid that
(5:21:10) the flip side of that is well women could also be tapped for duties that we need that only they could do um then you
(5:21:17) put us at massive disadvantages to our enemies so it's like so so how's this
(5:21:23) whole ideology guess I value Freedom over security and you vice versa no no no the opposite see see I think that
(5:21:31) freedom can only be can only be secured if you have if you have Force right so
(5:21:38) like force is necessary so like as the Greek said right without law there can be no freedom without law there can be
(5:21:44) no freedom I mean everyone would agree with that right you can't be free in an anarcho whatever with Warlords so right
(5:21:50) the but but if your entire ideology ends up from this one thing the the abortion
(5:21:56) thing leading to just Mass aversion to the point where we're not even able to draft to defend the nation if necessary
(5:22:03) why would I not see that entire ideology as being completely subversive
(5:22:09) can you repeat the first part yeah why wouldn't I see an ideology which says that I cannot defend the nation by drafting if necessary to defend it as
(5:22:17) being anything other than subversive yeah I mean I like I said before I think because I I'm coming from a a stance
() 
(5:22:23) of no one should be forced to do something and maybe that leaves someone at a disadvantage touch my blade donated
(5:22:30) one more follow I'm done she should live in another country and see what it looks like when she isn't protected stop
(5:22:36) anticipating what I'm going to say my the same way yeah so so this was this was my question
(5:22:41) now I want I want to just make sure that I got this clear let us assume for a second the government has Intel that a
(5:22:49) horrible barbaric nation is about to attack us okay we need to draw every man
(5:22:56) from their home okay this nation declares that it's going to put every single woman in that nation in camps and
(5:23:04) Essay them every single day to the men if they're
(5:23:11) drafted go to fight that enemy well and I mean so that's that's
(5:23:18) ignoring my part that or my stance that a draft shouldn't be so you're were saying if the draft is in place and no
(5:23:25) there's no draft in place let us you're saying men should feel obligated to go no I'm just asking should they be compelled to do it even in the situation
(5:23:31) where the enemy is so is such that if they do not the enemy declares that they're going to essay every single
(5:23:37) woman and then put them all to the sword they should feel obligated yes but they shouldn't be forced they shouldn't be forced I don't think anyone should be
(5:23:42) forced so even if the entailment of this is is that it's worse for us not to do
(5:23:47) this for the society which is around us all the women go to the camp right and the men will be killed and the men will
(5:23:53) be it's still know
(5:23:59) okay I want to actually congratulate both both of you I thought that was a fantastic
(5:24:06) exchange yeah okay uh we have a couple chats here that
() 
(5:24:11) uh came through uh blade he did really quick this
(5:24:16) one touch my BL donated $200 the one you should let an invasion happen maybe by a
(5:24:23) nation that doesn't have the same values think of one a bad one if men don't want
(5:24:29) to fight cool now you have new Masters which would you prefer new war yeah
(5:24:35) right so this I mean so you're exactly Right Touch My blade so my kind of
(5:24:40) thought process here is that um if other nations knew that there would be no way to compel uh the citizenry to go and
(5:24:48) fight especially in modernity um those would be the Nations I'd want to invade
(5:24:53) especially if the ailment of it was like we will never Force you under any circumstances even if your women are
(5:24:59) getting butchered in the streets that's the no no it's just kind of to me it just seems like it's so absurd you know
(5:25:04) it just seems that makes sense that's a good point and I guess I just I I that's not topic I've like to the extreme that
(5:25:10) I've really re thought about enough so I mean but these are realistic scenarios right yeah no they are they are things
(5:25:15) to think about especially historically when it came to Warfare where I mean now there's like rules of war and stuff
(5:25:21) which even today are still broken you see this going on and there's no rules to War I mean Israel just blew up
(5:25:27) everybody's pager right there's no rules anymore but also with the birth rate as well Israel's a really good example of
(5:25:33) that because they were getting outbred by the Palestinians Y and then I think
(5:25:38) it wasat who was a Palestinian leader said his greatest weapon is the woman's womb because they were just breeding
(5:25:44) breeding breeding and then Israel knew that they were going to become a minority so then they had a mass propaganda campaign to get their birth
(5:25:51) rate up and they did they did they gave free inv vitro fertilization they they
(5:25:57) would do it up to 10 to 10 times but the problem is is that it can't be sustained
(5:26:02) because the age that women are having children is in their 30s now and since that's the case it's not going to be
(5:26:07) sustainable and and I mean as recently as World War II I think on the German side and the Russian side you know as
(5:26:14) the Germans entered into Russia and then as Russia entered back into Germany wasn't there significant amounts of uh
(5:26:21) well Stalin stopped all abortion inside of the Soviet Union because he knew he needed the numbers so they stopped all
(5:26:27) abortion because they knew they needed the numbers of soldiers that were going to be necessary required to defend the
(5:26:33) motherland so they stopped it all but I'm just saying the and by the way they they were the ones ultimately who won World War to so yeah but yeah I was more
(5:26:40) so saying just like the the women were being victimized as Germany went into Russia and as Russia then turn went into
(5:26:48) back into Germany so Russ well they called it the well the RW of Berlin for a reason like they literally went
(5:26:54) through and yeah the whole country they just n King as well Vietnam uh we have
(5:27:00) law paladins here it's not an odd standard it's a very consistent standard anti-human ideology babies are bad men
(5:27:07) dying in Wars good uh blank good abortions good career good
(5:27:12) family's bad ask her about breeders well it's I didn't even say that I I agree babies are bad I I agree you didn't say
(5:27:19) that I 100% agree with that and I would not put words in your mouth I just look for the entailments of the position like
(5:27:25) where does this lead where does this idea eventually go touch my blade donated $200 thank you blade seems a
(5:27:32) somewhat what privileged opinion to not worry about if men will protect you in a
(5:27:37) nation that they already do historically and currently right well and it would be
(5:27:43) really funny I think intersectionalist could do something really good about this right they could kind of take the wind out of the sales of men by saying
(5:27:51) okay we're just not going to count men as a monolith but then they couldn't count women as a monolith and if they
(5:27:58) can't count women as a monolith it can't be a whole oppressed class because they're they outnumber men at 51% to 49
(5:28:04) men go wait a second that makes no sense you outnumber us and they go well yeah but we're still an oppressed minority
(5:28:10) because of power dynamics and so we have to count the entire thing it's like okay well then you have to count men as a
(5:28:16) monolith too which is just crazy to me we have Lord 69 where is
(5:28:25) it uh chair 4 why do you have such a lack of respect for men why are you so unappreciative of men my name is Lily
(5:28:32) and I do respect and appreciate men I think there are a lot of men that are great that doesn't mean I don't think
(5:28:38) are 30% 30% you said 30% okay I don't you forced me to pick a number I don't
(5:28:43) have like I didn't force you well you were pushing me to do it if I was silent you originally you said 40% something 70
(5:28:50) 70 million men in the unit my response that I do respect and appreciate men do we need men
(5:28:55) yes just like we need women we need both I don't think there's a world where it can just you don't think
(5:29:01) okay what do you think meditating on that one um
(5:29:08) huh oh she wants to tangle on that one um I'm not I'm not I'm not convinced on
(5:29:15) that to be honest with you okay but for the same reasons that you wouldn't be right so I just say like sure men are
(5:29:22) men are total monsters right and say that and since they could well no this is me right it's like okay if men really
(5:29:28) are the Capa have the capacity to just be kind of like these oppressive monsters then why not just handmade tail the whole thing you just put all the
(5:29:34) women in the cages right and uh just like life stock them if you wanted to
(5:29:39) women could never do that in opposition and so because of that I'm like it seems like men are pretty benevolent because
(5:29:45) they really could and have in other countries done that like in the Middle East places like this they completely
(5:29:50) stripped the rights of women kind of overnight and women can't really do much about it but but they can't do it in
(5:29:56) reverse right they can't make men do this in Reverse so when the question becomes are women necessary it's like
(5:30:03) yeah I can agree that women are necessary to have children but are they necessary to run a society clearly not not like clearly not like I can point to
(5:30:11) you many societies right now where they're totally unnecessary in the running of the society like that's just factually true
(5:30:18) now what you're doing is you're taking this in your head I can tell you this right now here's what you're doing you're going he actually believes that
(5:30:24) you should put women in cages and do horrible thing even though I literally never said a word like that I just want
(5:30:31) to let you know right now that that's not my a claim I'm just saying what is true good but I wasn't yeah so what so
(5:30:37) what is true is that no I don't think Society needs women to function I don't think it needs them in any support role
(5:30:43) really I don't think it needs them in any leadership role whatsoever I think that if women were essentially relegated
(5:30:49) to second class citizens as an is statement not an ought as an is statement if women were relegated second
(5:30:55) class citizens think Society wouldd be fine that's really upsetting to hear so you really just think that women exist to give birth see that's the see the I
(5:31:02) see the a you see the a there that you did there you think women only exist to do that's an a CL I'm not saying I don't
(5:31:10) think women only exist to do that I'm telling you descriptively I want you to answer to the descriptor with a counter
(5:31:17) descriptor I think it is true not ought to be but is true that if women were
(5:31:23) relegated to second class citizen touch my blade donated
(5:31:28) $200 if all men passed instantly or if all women pass this guy's like always 5
(5:31:34) seconds behind me on this would last longer take infrastructure Power Water food farming Etc I I just want the the
(5:31:42) the counter descriptor so I'm not saying this should be true I'm not saying that you should do any of this because you
(5:31:49) shouldn't I'm just giving the descriptor of what is correct and accurate so from my view it is correct descriptively true
(5:31:57) that if all women were made into second class citizens tomorrow they had no real rights they were not allowed in
(5:32:03) government positions of any kind nor leadership positions that society would be just there would not be any like I can't
(5:32:11) really even Envision I just really can't even really Envision any problems
(5:32:16) honestly so I'm I'm waiting for a counter descriptor to say NOP I do think
(5:32:22) that there would be lots and lots and lots of problems and here's what they would be but I don't want to hear a what
(5:32:27) we should do because I already agree with you we shouldn't do this well not enough women have even been in government to prove that they have the
(5:32:34) capabilities to help run it yeah but that doesn't counter the descriptor of what of of this being true like let's
(5:32:40) I'm I'm just going to grant that like maybe women would be the best bestest rulers ever um let's say they occupied
(5:32:47) 90% of government they'd be way better than men my descriptor though is just that if all women were relegated to
(5:32:53) second class citizenry I don't see why Society wouldn't function fine I mean I just disagree with you
(5:32:59) just on the grounds of you can't have one what is it strata or like one type
(5:33:06) of person be power well it wouldn't be one type of person it would be thousands of different types of people men it
(5:33:12) would be men yeah but but wait wait there's only well there's only two types of humans right men and women right
(5:33:18) right so there's male and fale Ty person but can't we point to cultures right now where women are completely disenfranchised from all power roles and
(5:33:24) the society functions fine not for them they're miserable they're it's not they can't do the things they want I agree
(5:33:30) it's not good for the women the women don't like it but that not contending again with the descriptor the descriptor
(5:33:36) is would Society be fine like you could have a totally happiness of their citizens and the abilities of for them
(5:33:43) to act out according to their own needs and wants and so if women are oppressed and they can't do that then it's not a
(5:33:49) it's not a stable and good Society for everybody what if they have a a massive brainwashing program which convinces all
(5:33:55) of the women that they're actually happy as many of these nations do and so
(5:34:00) the women report we're really happy no I'm not kidding like this is
(5:34:05) this is true right this second I can point to you many countries where this is the case golf States yep y tons tons
(5:34:11) of them you at countries like qar Dubai
(5:34:16) they don't have really any women in positions of power at all tomorrow here's how it's going be second second
(5:34:22) class citizens there Twitter here's Twitter tomorrow right Andrew Wilson says we should do thing I literally said
(5:34:28) we should never do just giving a descriptor but I can already tell I can already
(5:34:33) tell he wants women in cages I could just I can hear it now well pal says thank you Andrew vote Andrew 2024
(5:34:40) Taliban party but seriously you've already absorbed anti-ab propaganda idiocracy handmaids tale even cartoons
(5:34:46) you watched as baby Fern Fern goalie too many human that was that was a banger of
(5:34:52) a movie by the way that other guy real sharp what is his name Slade blade blade yeah my blade he seems my blade he seems
(5:34:59) like he's he's on he's on point he's he's uh he's been uh firing off uh well
(5:35:04) I think also maybe Andrew you can speak to like the actual I guess practical application
(5:35:11) here when it comes to men being involved in critical infrastructure and is that kind of the angle that you're coming at
(5:35:16) this with like no I'm literally coming at it from all angles if women were removed from all societal function like
(5:35:23) let's say that this is a Middle Eastern nation where you can't walk down the street without like having a male escort
(5:35:30) those Nations I'm not kidding they exist right now I know that for some reason feminists think that this is like you're
(5:35:35) talking about a hypothetical handmaid these civilizations exist right now and they have hundreds of millions of people
(5:35:42) in them hundreds of millions um if you remove women from all
(5:35:48) critical roles in society these nations keep going fine like they and and in many cases they
(5:35:55) Thrive like that is descriptively true so I don't even know why people argue it it's like I
(5:36:01) agree is a little bit more liberal but like yeah it's just true right you're look at countries like uh Saudi it's
(5:36:08) like that saud's a pretty prosperous country it's like that all over all over the Middle East it's like that in many regions of uh Asian Nations as well it's
(5:36:16) like that in many many places where like women are completely removed from all positions of a Power Authority autonomy
(5:36:23) and just I mean yeah the society's function like now you can say it's not optimal sure you can say it's morally
(5:36:29) reprehensible agreed but that's not taking away the fact that they were touch my blade
(5:36:35) donated $200 I'm Australian so we still know what's up plad great did he lose you now
(5:36:42) with the Australian thing he lost you people been sitting here trying to convince me forever that country exists
(5:36:48) not a real country make some a comment about what you said cuz it's actually a great Point um one of my favorite
() 
(5:36:53) graphic novels is called why the last man and yeah H readit yeah and essentially one day all of the men just
(5:36:59) with yorri isn't that his name Yori or yurin or something yeah yor yor yeah and
(5:37:06) Society completely fell part because women only make up like 2% of Engineers or doctors and they didn't know what to
(5:37:13) do I mean you have to read it it's actually a really cool perspective Society was completely decimated one
(5:37:18) last and it went insane because it helps you realize like how much Men actually
(5:37:24) have a a role in society when I feel like this generation in the sense makes
(5:37:29) it seem like they don't or try to downplay men you know and it's very easy
(5:37:35) to to forget how important they are and how much they do have to contribute and
(5:37:40) how much expectations they are put on them from the moment they're born yeah I agree with you I think I think that
(5:37:46) you're you're you push this point right that people actually get very very upset
(5:37:53) if you just kind of point out obvious things that that contend with their kind of preconceived notions in this
(5:38:00) particular case most of human history most of human society and currently I
(5:38:05) would say most Societies in the World outside of the West women are relegated to secondary roles and Society is
(5:38:13) absolutely flourished I just want right except the West the West is the only one
(5:38:18) way below thresholds or birth rates they're the ones who are way below kind of these thriving rates and so it's like
(5:38:25) descriptively I can clearly see that women were relegated historically to a lesser role and in most Nations right
(5:38:32) the second they're relegated to a lesser role and these societies function fine so this like idea that women must be in
(5:38:38) all these it's just absurd to me I don't I don't even understand why anybody would argue with that they they could
(5:38:44) say um again you make the moral arguments against it I would agree right I don't want them in a secondary role
() 
(5:38:50) I'm just saying that descriptively it you know obvious I can see with my own eyeballs that these societies are not
(5:38:56) going like out of existence because women are not in government I would like to bring it back to dating for at least
(5:39:02) the most of the ends of the show but you do seem to be shaking your head here is there still disagreement on this I'm
(5:39:10) done you're you're done I'm done was it was it the misogyny was it the Raging Andrew Wilson
(5:39:17) misogyny that did it even though it was like a or it wasn't a clim su like men
(5:39:23) Superior Superior yeah like okay you proved you're better like I don't know like what are you even trying why why are you arguing for that I didn't never
(5:39:29) argue for valid I don't think you by the by the way I just want to let you know hang on I just want to let you know I
(5:39:34) never argued for it hang on hang on I would like you to acknowledge that not one time did I
(5:39:41) actually argue for that no nope can't do it you if you give a descriptor you
(5:39:46) believe it do you think society would be better without
(5:39:52) men I don't think society would would be better without men or women like there need to be both also to point for for
(5:39:59) society women need ners Educators caregivers and that's not to say that they can't also do other things and yes
(5:40:06) maybe this book you read prove that like they 3% or 2% of Engineers or doctors or whatever but if in a world
(5:40:12) hypothetically if men did not exist a a world could still flourish with just women I'm not it can if just men a world
(5:40:18) could flourish just women a world could flourish but with both there needs to be some kind of level ground where both can
(5:40:24) flourish at the same time without pushing down another exactly but I I almost wonder if this is more so like
(5:40:29) and we've we've gone into these like apocalyptic scenarios where where what
(5:40:35) would happen if all men disappeared instantly or all women disappeared instantly and I think perhaps Andrew a
(5:40:42) little bit of what he's getting to although he seems to have expanded on in a bit is that if all women were to have
(5:40:49) to disappear it would suck that would be terrible it would be the end of the
(5:40:55) species but when it comes to the survival oh Andrew disagrees okay what
(5:41:01) what the the bone marrow [ __ ] okay um because men are involved in critical
(5:41:06) infrastructure the world would continue but if you were
(5:41:12) to remove all men from the world instantly it would be catastrophic and I
(5:41:21) think majority of women would be dead within 3 weeks men no if women were
(5:41:26) allowed the education and resources that men had in the past they be able to have they are they wer allow to have school
(5:41:31) before and if in the past today you can do anything as a woman today yeah you just get paid less women were always the
(5:41:36) most oh just so you know just so you know women were always the most yeah they were always the most
(5:41:42) literate actually women women knew how to read more than you're talking about engineering jobs if we had opportuni the
(5:41:48) better okay hang on I'll address it wait you're right okay that almost nobody had an engineering job almost everybody
() 
(5:41:54) worked locally right you had localized Farms things like that that's where most people kind of did what they did there
(5:42:00) wasn't um when you when you're talking about specializations things like that wasn't a thing most people did most
(5:42:06) people uh kind of grew up in a region stayed in that region and they did things like family farms uh you know
(5:42:12) kind of localized jobs Farm hands things like that it's mostly labor kind of Labor based rather than specialty based
(5:42:19) but women right interestingly enough they actually had the highest literacy rates still do still do and so um there
(5:42:28) was a there was kind of an emphasis in a value put on that support role where it was more necessary than just hey dumb
(5:42:34) guy lift heavy thing right so I've I've never really believed in the suppression Olympics that um that historically
(5:42:41) because women had a different role that that meant that they were supremely oppressed and opposition to me I've
(5:42:46) never thought that that was true I feel like if they could fill other rules during that time they could have flourished and became drain in their
(5:42:52) rule which rules what which roles like admin like Administration
(5:42:58) government well okay what in government anything political positions what time I I don't understand how that
(5:43:06) how would that have helped their practical skills their practical skills yeah so well his his his thought process
(5:43:12) here is like okay because because men are so necessary more equal would be
(5:43:18) down here hang on I'll explain okay continue so he's saying if we remove all men from all the critical infrastructure
(5:43:25) much of it they do because only they can do it right it actually requires great amount of physical strength to be
(5:43:30) underwater right now it would crumble it it wouldn't yeah yeah yeah but but if historically women had been uh I don't
(5:43:36) know allowed access to like engineering and things like this uh which by and large they they honestly did uh just to
(5:43:44) a lesser degree uh I don't understand how that would suddenly make them in in charge of all this critical
(5:43:51) infrastructure that men move towards and women don't I feel like if women were never impressed in the past then we would be more level why because we women
(5:44:00) women in the most egalitarian Nations on planet Earth still move away from engineering and applied science jobs and
(5:44:06) move move towards well mostly secretarial work and service work which is where they're at right now if you
(5:44:12) look at the top 10 jobs of women uh what do you think they are it's like teacher
(5:44:18) nurse secretary right they're doing the same [ __ ] they were doing 100 years ago when given the choice in other words
(5:44:24) they still move towards the same occupations that they were they they could do that's what Society set up for
(5:44:30) them to do right now now we have more availab then why do they move still towards I did that exactly ex L actually
(5:44:37) I was originally going to study um I studied at Embry Riddle I was going to be an aerospace engineer so I was
(5:44:43) getting my associates for engineering fundamentals and I switched it to ultrasound tech yeah you know and it's
(5:44:49) it just I mean was mostly calculus and trigonometry they're actually desperately trying to her them into those into those career yeah but they
(5:44:56) they don't want them do it they don't want them yeah and I understand why men and women would have completely
(5:45:01) different interests in different things you know I totally understand why and then take into for example like
(5:45:09) Roofing and concreting and all of these things that not even these don't even require women to go to university like
(5:45:15) applied engering sort of role these are just like ice Road Trucking and all these really dangerous heavy lifting
(5:45:21) jobs workers yeah yeah we're not even talking atin can you get that pulled up and then can you physically couldn't do
(5:45:27) it can you get that pulled up and then can you also can you also get
(5:45:32) the the uh cockroach video please do you have the cockroach
(5:45:38) video prioritize the cockroach video there's a cockroach
(5:45:43) video I yeah I don't think so that's just person okay go
(5:45:48) ahead all right Plumbing just play it just play it all right this is a man uh
() 
(5:45:56) not a lot of women are uh willing to do this job not part you know doesn't
(5:46:02) appear particularly dangerous but it's dirty and it's it's gross did you ask
(5:46:09) women that if they were willing to or not yeah it's been available to them sanitation workers been available to for
(5:46:14) are you scared of spiders yes are you scared of spiders be honest hold on touch my blade donated
(5:46:22) $200 I personally find it easier to learn language after I have shelter food
(5:46:28) water security only mainly because without those things I'm not alive to
(5:46:33) learn language just me though he's money scared of spiders
(5:46:40) mosquitoes scared of spiders terrified of them scared of spiders no no no no
(5:46:47) yeah yep no okay hav I gra SP not scared SP scar spers what's his name are you
(5:46:55) scared of spiders no have have any of you ever asked crush him with my hand yeah it's cuz you're men right so but
(5:47:01) have any of you ever lived with a man or been in a room with a man and there was a bug of some kind yeah he ran away
(5:47:08) screaming so I got it for him that's a okay well you date soy boy liberal Cuts that's pretty funny I mean it is
(5:47:16) what it is but look I've encountered my own anecdotal experience I have spiders
(5:47:22) I've had spiders in my rooms women are like he a spider women
(5:47:28) you've been with cuz but I I'm not I say that there submissive women that are willing to just do whatever you say
(5:47:34) exactly what submissive to you you panicked when a guy had an unloaded rifle what are you
(5:47:41) talking about you sure someone had a gun towards you if you didn't know unloaded rifle that your boyfriend walked around
(5:47:47) with an unloaded rifle we play the other one let's do the other one really quick all right what about this what about
(5:47:52) this okay all right now this is more this is really intense that so sick he chose to do that nobody told him get
(5:47:59) that someone here's the reality yeah somebody has to do it women ain't trying to do this [ __ ] [ __ ] that I would do
(5:48:05) that [ __ ] you you see the lights in here you see the lights you know when it's [ __ ] freezing do that some women
(5:48:11) would but you know y all enjoy light do you like electricity like what do you do right now you me yeah I just moved here
(5:48:18) so I'm just in school what have you done before as a job I was a ride operator you were a what a ride operator what is
(5:48:25) that I operated right at at six at six you mean you mean he had the
(5:48:31) little switch panel and he pushed the button and it made the ride go yeah you
(5:48:37) I just want to make sure I got you would climb up there in the middle of a
(5:48:42) snowstorm do that job I would if I was trained yeah anyways all right I believe you
(5:48:50) that was interesting we need to get through a couple things here so let's
(5:48:56) see uh or you said something sorry really quick your thing I forgot what I said oh
(5:49:03) okay yeah totally yeah yeah of course that happened remind me what I said so I can back myself up huh I really forgot so
(5:49:09) you remind me do you guys enoy I was like do you guys enjoy electricity you're like do you well yeah right but
(5:49:16) the difference is can you survive off you can't yeah but the difference is I acknowledge that if it wasn't for men
(5:49:22) who are in infrastructure jobs we would not be enjoying the electricity with
(5:49:28) which we have it's just electricity like yeah men do the job for it but like at the end day do you realize how important
(5:49:35) electricity is if there even if we didn't remove just electricity wanted to do that even if we didn't get rid of
(5:49:41) even if we didn't get rid of like the sewage and the telecoms and the the trucking and the transportation I've
(5:49:48) know girls are truckers too okay even if we didn't get rid of those other things
(5:49:53) do you realize how pampered the lives we live are if we singularly got rid of
(5:49:59) electricity we would all be like collectively panicking and [ __ ] if
(5:50:05) it's in the winter we're dead yeah I 100% agree with you I never said I
(5:50:11) did don't you need electricity too all I ask grateful for the men who provide it
(5:50:16) while your pedes have contempt for men I'm grateful for everybody that has put the effort to give us electricity
(5:50:23) everybody male female cuz you're telling me not one female has not helped of course it's all just male male male male
(5:50:29) male I mean look here here's the point BL we need somebody to sign the paychecks for
(5:50:35) sure men are unilaterally responsible for every bit of comfort and security
(5:50:42) you are currently ungratefully enjoying that's the difference I acknowledge I
(5:50:48) don't I don't have that kind of job but I touch my blade donated $200 internet is cool phones are fun any
(5:50:58) deep sea divers in the group what is your favorite welder you more Mig or
(5:51:03) gunal nobody cares I mean there wasn't where electricity didn't exist in the human race did just fine that doesn't
(5:51:09) mean it's not a great thing but also if we're going to talk about what roles are more important than another one if we're going to talk women if women are you
(5:51:15) know delegated to second class whatever roles those are okay well if you think there are certain positions meant for
(5:51:21) women and then we I'm not even saying that but go ahead go ahead you're saying nothing is then just go ahead go ahead
(5:51:26) go your point if those are caregivers nurturers educators are those not just as important as the physical aspects of
(5:51:31) this world so if men if women are are delegated to these roles or if they're more if they're better these rules it's
(5:51:37) because they have specific traits that men don't which is empathy caring love whatever and that do not say men don't but it's less so what if it's just the
(5:51:43) world of men who are in like the higher class levels than they was a world of like social higher class wait what do
(5:51:48) you mean higher class levels I mean sorry like you said you said first class or first level second level you're going
(5:51:54) back to Andrew's argument yeah so when you're talking when you're talking about traits um so I I'd reject your first premise where you say women are doing
(5:52:00) these jobs because they have traits which acclimate them to the job so I just kind of reject that and say well no
(5:52:06) I think that they do those jobs because they don't have the traits to do the other ones that's what you're assuming so the men are doing the roles that
(5:52:12) they're doing because they have the they have better trait they capacity they have the capacity you're saying that women do let
(5:52:18) me answer the question hang on let me answer it okay what I'm saying is that
(5:52:25) if you were to take away the idea that wait it could be that women are only
(5:52:31) relegated to do these jobs because they have the best traits to do the jobs I would just give the kind of counter
(5:52:37) response that no they're relegated to do those jobs even though men can do those jobs because those are the jobs that
() 
(5:52:42) women are capable of doing even though men are equally as capable of doing them and by the way I will go ahead and give
(5:52:48) you the benefit of the doubt that I'm wrong all you have to do is give me a single job that you think that men are
(5:52:54) not just as capable of women at doing and I will do the same with men to you go ahead okay well parenting mothering
(5:53:02) nurturing educating what par educating definitely educ I just want to make anything that has a one at a time one at
(5:53:08) a time so let's start with mothering right you would you would agree with me
(5:53:14) that women only do that job because they're the only ones who can be mothers right yeah okay but when you're talking
(5:53:20) about parenting you there's no way you're ever going to say that women are just better parents than men or men
(5:53:27) can't do that job as well as women right you are you would say that I would say
(5:53:32) yes more more fathers are absent than mothers yeah but that doesn't mean that the capability of men to do the job of
(5:53:38) parenting is not equal to that of women how then well you're making this kind of great conflation that because they don't
(5:53:45) they can't I'm making the exact opposite argument because women don't go for these jobs they can't no no no that's a
(5:53:52) different argument so your argument was uh if they're relegated to those roles by men then they're relegated to those
(5:53:59) roles because men think that they're valuable in those in those roles because they have the traits that acclimate them
(5:54:05) to those roles I'm saying the opposite I'm saying no that uh men can
(5:54:10) easily do those jobs just as easily as they can do the jobs that they're in now but the reverse is not true okay so when
(5:54:17) you say parenting I think that men are just as capable of parenting as women okay we can disagree you don't think
(5:54:22) they're just as capable so why is it that you wait wait hang on you don't think they're just as cap just like you
(5:54:28) don't think women aren't as capable for certain positions I think men aren't as capable for other positions that are equally as important that I just named
(5:54:35) what educating nurturing parenting lit any of these roles that you think are delegated why like well then why do you
(5:54:41) think these other position I'll tell you I'll tell you I'll tell you but let's start we already went over soldiering
(5:54:46) for instance right and no women are not just capable of men at soldiering no they're not I didn't say were now I'm
(5:54:52) saying that's my example then you're your example I would like you to give me whatever your evidentiary is that men
(5:54:58) are not just as good Educators as women let's look at professorships let's look uh globally at professorships let hang
(5:55:05) on let's look at Scholars let's look at doctors let's look at lawyers well wait I'm I'm not disputing that women can do
(5:55:12) those jobs never disputed it I'm just telling you that men can do them equally as good and so if that's the case I'm
(5:55:18) giving you counter examples where women can't do this job equally as good like sanitation so so I don't so I really
(5:55:24) don't understand the equation right and also in terms of parenting if you look at the stats of single mother households
(5:55:30) compared to single father households the single mother households are much more likely to produce criminals to produce
(5:55:35) people who are mentally ill to produce people who live in poverty feminists male feminists and the like male
(5:55:42) feminist father isn't present mother and the baby needs both parents no no this is Statics hold on uh Jake can you give
(5:55:49) your concrete that's a great feminist counter actually the great kind of great
(5:55:54) feminist counter is well that's because men aren't present so all the data is coming from single mom households
(5:56:00) because there so many of them to tr choose from I agree with that actually that's a great Counterpoint thank you
(5:56:05) the problem is is that now we're able to now the court system has changed men are able to get custody
(5:56:11) of their children more so now what we we can do is we can look at the data of that's true they they startle more int so now we can look at the data of what
(5:56:17) happens when you grow up in a single father household versus single mother and we can draw it one to one the outcomes are still better in a single
(5:56:23) father household than single mother just that's a very I think that's very opinion wait wait that's not opinion do
(5:56:28) you want to give your concreting example then I'm going to move it on to dating I was just going to say do you guys like Barack Obama do you think he was a good
(5:56:34) president yes by the way also find that data that I just cited on the substack
(5:56:39) of Rachel Wilson she she got all of it together so that you can see for yourself and single father versus single
(5:56:46) mother households how they how they far differently okay I can look into that well it was it was Barack Obama who actually said that they're 20 times more
(5:56:53) likely to end up in prison and I'm not sure the other statistics but far far more likely to end up in poverty and far
(5:56:59) far more likely to end up in prison ohon why is that so you're saying if you ended up single you had a kid your kid
(5:57:05) would be the most complete trash just because you're singly mothering him that's not what I'm saying that's a very extreme place to take it's just based
(5:57:12) off of actual numbers no but like you I'm talking about you though you seem like you'd be pretty happy in a world
(5:57:18) where women are just like pushed down and they don't really get to do whatever they want bow down to a guy you take
(5:57:23) that like yeah really it's in my fa all your Harding money to go to a man the
(5:57:30) think in this room is hold on a second hold on a second think you deserve the world let her respond you going to take
(5:57:36) I think that women we compliment men very well just like they compliment us very well they're excellent protectors
(5:57:42) providers and leaders so but saying you're not though you're not an excellent provider leader why I don't
(5:57:48) think that women should be the providers I think men should be the providers Jo I'm not saying you're the provider I'm asking you if you feel like you should
(5:57:55) bow down to a man just because he gives you everything do you give him to my man yes that's what I believe in that's what
(5:58:02) it says in my Bible that says how I'm supposed to honor my husband and he's supposed to love me just as that you're
(5:58:07) supposed to love you can honor your husband respect him but Al it should also be love towards both from both
(5:58:13) sides like you should not feel like you need to bow down to a man love on both sides but you're bowing down to a man
(5:58:19) I'm not bowing down to him I'm compliment you just said you would can I cut in for a second who the [ __ ] cares
(5:58:26) who cares that's how somebody wants to live in their life not not about you
(5:58:31) like who cares if you're going to bow down to a man or if you're going to be the leader like [ __ ] feminism first off
(5:58:38) because it is so annoying like you can be a woman listen you can be a woman and support women's rights but not put down
(5:58:45) men because of it you're sitting there talking [ __ ] about them you are so sweet but I'm pissed off like it is just so
(5:58:53) aggravating how are you wait into the mic please into the mic sorry how are you going to get upset if she wants to
(5:58:58) bow down to her man because of her religion or how she feels I'm not getting upset I'm just asking her a
(5:59:04) question yeah what you know about that I think that was directed at you by the way what she said so yeah I know it was
(5:59:09) and I said she was sweet but I'm still mad I think you should Cur take it a task for not curb
(5:59:16) stomper I just I just we just disagree I just don't I don't think you should ever
(5:59:22) feel okay bowing down to somebody I mean I I'll drop it like I'm not I'm not I
(5:59:27) don't want to attack you for that that's your belief if that's your belief I respect that if that's what you believe awesome like do you me be submissive
(5:59:33) though yeah I mean okay maybe if that's who you are and who you want to be then
(5:59:38) be that I'm not going to attack that so you're like for getting you're like down 50/50 in a relationship yeah so you'd
() 
(5:59:47) prefer equality over chivalry yeah mhm I'm going to say it as nice all the
(5:59:53) bills so first date first dateing you you split the bill you split the bill on
(5:59:59) the first dateing like you insist on splitting B I pay for some of the dates like we go back and
(6:00:04) forth no no no okay let's talk about first dates how many First Dates have you been on uh not really like a formal
(6:00:11) first date we just like have you been to dinner have you been to a movie with someone I've been in a relationship with
(6:00:16) for a while you've never been on a first date not really I mean we've I mean I
(6:00:23) guess technically yeah techn I mean yeah sure like yes but not like yes yes what
(6:00:29) okay um who paid I don't remember the guy didn't it I'm sure for one of the
(6:00:36) guys or some of the guys not every single time I've been first date they've paid I don't know I can't pull up numbers I don't remember you don't so
(6:00:42) you don't have a preference for men paying though no so you split the bill
(6:00:48) yeah uh and then when it comes to last name are you going to hyphenate your last name I would like to yes if you get
(6:00:53) married yes okay do you want the man to protect you well I think we actually establish
(6:00:59) needed but in other moments if I'm able to do so I'll do that uh of all the men you've dated who took the initiative the
(6:01:05) romantic initiative the man I'm not I'm not as romantic though or or well who took the
(6:01:11) the initiative what do you mean the who made the first move I did in all not in every
(6:01:20) single one of them not in every single one of them well are you talking so you're saying just because a man makes the first move he's like that's a gender
(6:01:26) role that's a gender role okay well yeah it is a gender role it doesn't mean it's it's it has to stick and be Universal
(6:01:32) and stay a lot of men don't like that gender rule because they feel like they're not getting romantic affection
(6:01:38) it doesn't matter whether men like it or not men have to operate in reality so I could W I could have this sort of
(6:01:44) Wishful Thinking where yeah as a as a guy I as an average man I wish I had the
(6:01:50) sexual and romantic attention the same exact sexual and romantic attention as the average woman pick someone up an
(6:01:57) hour so can you not interrupt please but that would be wishful thinking average
(6:02:02) men can't just wait around for women to make the move right that is true so we have to operate in a reality the reality
(6:02:09) is men have to take the initiative men have to make the first move we have to ask you out we have to plan the date we
(6:02:15) have to typically uh pay for the date we're going to have to move things forward if we want
(6:02:20) something you disagree the com down at his arms and he's
(6:02:26) like okay um
(6:02:32) so that's just the reality but a guy who drove a Lambo told me to he's actually ripped rich and red yeah
(6:02:38) he's ripped Rich World um it's not my fault so you're boyfriend you're
(6:02:44) currently in a relationship right yes one one you're I I have to pick someone up like

(6:04:14) what about the sorry the Gluck I don't [ __ ] know I don't agree that different do you have a different
(6:04:20) question for me because at this point I'm was tired well okay I'm leading into my question do you think men who care
(6:04:25) about body count are insecure um who care if you have a high body
() 
(6:04:32) count I don't think they're insecure anymore yeah like they wouldn't date a woman because he thinks she has a high
(6:04:38) body count whatever that is no I don't think they're insecure because of that okay ask me that question
(6:04:44) again can you ask me it again you mean the one that I just are they insecure
(6:04:50) are men insecure if they don't want to with a high body account no I just get self respect
(6:04:57) nope you're asking are men in SEC if they don't want to date a woman with the high body count no I definitely do think
(6:05:03) it's a preference and it's okay okay uh I need to wait until she's back for my follow-up question here why don't we
(6:05:10) just go ahead and do this we'll uh do the rast session and then we'll wrap up the show uh we have warlord 69 ooo oh
(6:05:16) wait did oh she's gone I'll have to pull it can I can I make just kind of one
(6:05:22) quick observation that I think it's really funny that when women say that they'll like bow to their husband and
(6:05:28) they'll submit and stuff like that all the feminists come out and scream that they're pikm and what's really funny
() 
(6:05:33) about that is they got picked m it's really funny when they all call them pmes and then turns out they got picked
(6:05:41) and I'm like well uh question for you do you think men who care about body count are insecure
(6:05:47) believe no okay going around the table what's your body count two you're not
(6:05:52) going to believe me zero already said 12 six five mine's a little bit higher it's

(6:06:48) whatever men I would say men I do feel like um especially in certain Wars women

(6:09:02) maybe seen the show before any disagreements on anything final thoughts final thoughts how about
(6:09:09) this final thoughts on anything speak now forever hold your PP
() 
(6:09:14) I had seen a podcast of you guys talking about abortion and we didn't talk about that huh we we didn't talk about that
(6:09:21) yep go oh cuz I I don't remember which one of you said it but you think that abortion should be completely BL uh
(6:09:26) banned which I I don't really give a [ __ ] like it shouldn't be banned especially for uh sexual assault and
(6:09:34) then just you the normal talk that people say when they talk about why abortion shouldn't be banned I just want
(6:09:41) to understand more like I I can't yeah I mean that we would have to
(6:09:46) launch into a pretty big explanation about when we think Life Begins things like that but that's that's I mean just
(6:09:53) like the reader digest version So like um me and her for instance we our disagreement on this would probably just
(6:09:59) be around when life begins mhm that would be the entirety of the actual argument it's like when does it begin so
(6:10:06) her justification for abortion would be well that's not a baby it's a fetus I would I would assume right um no I
(6:10:13) that's not my argument for like why it shouldn't be illegal well I mean you don't think it's baby and I think you
(6:10:19) should I think people just shouldn't get abortions just because they don't want a baby I think it should be encouraged to
(6:10:24) give birth but just like I don't think anything should be forced upon somebody but you do think it's human life yeah
(6:10:31) yeah I know I do okay just it's totally opposing to all your other views though okay well
