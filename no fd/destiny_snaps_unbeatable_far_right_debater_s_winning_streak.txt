Title: Destiny Snaps Unbeatable Far-Right Debater's Winning Streak

(0:00) not happening yes it's happening okay so you can say it's not happening but the demographic shift proves that it's

(0:05) happening demographic shift happening does not prove that they're being imported intentionally by some other group of people that's something that

(0:10) would actually say i didn't say that it proved it but okay you did you did just say that verbatim do you think you're going to be able to convince like wealthy successful people

(0:17) to just start becoming children factories if you offer them enough tax incentive yeah okay so it's not like money right

(0:22) now is preventing them from making more kids the child barrier is a monitor no no okay let's let's think right here for

(0:28) not having kids and why they're planning families it's for one reason one reason only money so you just told me that the

(0:34) higher up you go in income the less likely you are to have more children how does that point to it being an

(0:39) economic problem i don't think it has anything to do with racism at all

(0:45) there's a cultural thing that goes on with that also where does the culture come from uh

(0:50) generally it comes from a lack of father in the home yeah so where did this general idea this rejection of the modern american life or

(0:57) this bucking against the system where do this come from for black communities why do they exhibit this behavior more so than other

(1:03) communities in the united states it's hard to it's hard to say specifically a lot of people have tried to answer that question

(1:10) i know i've heard fuentes talk about this uh in depth and he thinks that there's a portion of it that's genetic

(1:18) i'm doing good all right so tonight is debate night we have a very exciting debate for you guys

(1:24) the topic is immigration and demographic shifts andrew since this is your topic why

(1:29) don't you get us started so i don't want to do the gish gallup

(1:34) i noticed in the second part of the debate that destiny had with nick fuentes as

(1:40) part of his response he kind of focused a lot on the gish gallop so i'm not going to get too bogged down in that

(1:46) i'm going to try to stay away from it tonight and try to come at this logically instead so i'm going to make my premise as

(1:52) simple as i possibly can and condense it to i don't want any illegal immigrants

(1:58) or legal immigrants to immigrate into the united states and i believe 100 percent and can prove

(2:04) that the flood of immigrants are mostly mostly coming in by design of

(2:11) the democratic party and the purpose of it is to bolster their voting roles and it is a complete and total

(2:18) subversion of democracy it's one of the major weaknesses with democracy and uh

(2:23) that's that's my premise for the debate

(2:29) okay destiny um yeah i guess i'm basically going to argue that i don't think you have some

(2:36) inalienable right to just permanently maintain some arbitrarily homogenous voting block

(2:42) indefinitely i don't think that it's possible i think the idea that you could keep some voting bloc homogeneous is

(2:49) silly i think there's a ton of different ways to influence a particular group of people whether immigrants voting a different way or whether foreign culture making

(2:55) somebody vote a different way and i think that if any group of people wanted to enact any of these changes it would literally require them to secede

(3:02) from the union to do so which makes it a pretty difficult idea to argue in favor of unless you want to get into

(3:07) a conversation should states or cities or counties be seceding from the union in order to accomplish their

(3:12) desire of um homogeneity i guess what about divorce what do you mean

(3:18) divorce uh well i mean that you can use provisions in the constitution to

(3:23) leave the union without any type of civil war sure but what do you do when you leave the union and the u.s invades

(3:29) here and just captures you and then reintegrates you back into the us well it's possible or it's possible could happen the other way i don't want

(3:34) to get bogged down i was just wait when you say the other way you think a county could secede from the u.s and then defeat the us in a war

(3:42) i have no idea okay i'm pretty confident when i say that i don't think anything could secede from the u.s and survive a

(3:47) war with the u.s especially not if you're like landlocked to the us but that's that's likely true but i want to

(3:53) focus on immigration instead we can get bogged down with the details of a landlocked war with the us during

(4:00) secession a different time okay what what about my position that the large hispanic voting bloc that's coming

(4:06) in uh is designed and bolstered and the democratic party specifically is

(4:13) bringing them in just to bolster the voting rolls um even if that goes go ahead

(4:19) oh yeah i mean even if that was the case like you don't have the right to just

(4:24) block anybody that disagrees with you politically from immigrating to your state like let's say that we don't want a hispanic person going from mexico to

(4:32) texas because it's going to change you know the overall voter composition of texas is texas allowed to say no immigrants from california

(4:38) or no immigration no but those aren't foreign they're not foreign yeah but you don't care that they're

(4:43) foreign you care that they vote for democrats no i i'm saying that they're bringing in foreigners specifically to bolster the

(4:48) the voting rolls what if they were bringing in people from california why would they need to bring in people

(4:54) from california those are already u.s citizens because they'll they would change the composition of the us the texas

(4:59) fine you can do demographic changes based on uh state-to-state immigration i'm talking specifically about

(5:05) foreigners coming in from mexico and subverting the united states uh uh electorate

(5:11) well there's no subversion there immigration is part of a legal process there's a process legal immigration illegal immigrants

(5:16) don't vote in federal elections well that's debatable whether or not illegal immigrants have voted

(5:22) there's many cases where illegal immigrants have voted how widespread it is you can make an argument for

(5:28) but well i mean if you win the debate if your debate is like illegal immigrants if the debate is illegal immigrants

(5:33) shouldn't be allowed to vote i mean i agree with you obviously aren't you but aren't you but isn't biden trying to naturalize

(5:39) millions of them right now who are here illegally right now in order to bolster his voting block

(5:44) if they were naturalized then they wouldn't be illegal anymore would they well right they wouldn't be illegal but if you're bringing them in specifically

(5:51) for the purposes of naturalizing them having soft border policies in order to do that that's a big problem

(5:57) i don't think they're being brought in specifically to bolster our voting block i think they're being i think that they

(6:02) come here for economic reasons and i think that both people that work in the us economy and maintain businesses in the u.s economy and people that

(6:08) immigrate here to work here would probably agree with that and you know you don't think that that's a guise considering that they have a super

(6:14) majority for just one party they vote in a super majority for just one specific party the same party who

(6:20) happens to tailor legislation specifically for them you don't think that that's coincidental

(6:26) you know that's just a coincidence so when you say coincidence what you're really saying is here's a story that i have and it sounds good but i have

(6:32) absolutely no proof of that oh that's not what i'm saying well it is because you don't have any you have no proof that they're bringing in people to get

(6:38) more voters for them right that's not you don't have like a statement abide in saying we're going to bring in these hispanics and they're going to vote in

(6:43) seven years for democrats right which and i don't even know if that'd be a good strategy because i think in the last election we saw more hispanics

(6:49) um i think than ever go for the republican party so i don't know that just seems it seems more obvious like if i just follow this but the super majority

(6:56) stays in the comfortably in the democratic zone and it has for an awful long time

(7:02) what super majority are we talking about from that i'm talking about a super majority of hispanics vote for democrats

(7:07) wait what yeah but that could change over time why do they have to vote for democrats it hasn't but it hasn't changed over time

(7:13) it's it hasn't it hasn't hardly changed over time at all in fact i have a chart showing you that

(7:19) it really hasn't changed over time do you acknowledge it what's that so are you saying that it's just it's impossible that republicans

(7:25) could ever get hispanic people to vote for them no i'm not saying it's impossible i'm saying that if you tailor

(7:31) your legislation specifically with the welfare state to uh pander to hispanics specifically and

(7:38) you have a never-ending supply of them just south of the border it makes logical sense that you would

(7:43) tailor your policies have weak border policies to bring them in to bolster your voting bloc the swing

(7:48) states are proof of that do you think almost all these swing states are only swing states because of which demographic

(7:55) it's not black demographic yeah so it seemed to me that under donald trump

(8:00) if we're to believe the numbers published by the administration which i have no reason not to distrust them that unemployment under

(8:07) trump was getting to absurdly low levels i want to say we were at like three and a half percent nationwide at one point

(8:12) or it might have been four percent we were below the natural rate of unemployment right we have a huge problem finding

(8:18) workers in the united states it seems more reasonable to me to assume that people immigrate here because there

(8:23) are work opportunities and people here generally like immigrants because they need to find employees to hire in their businesses

(8:28) anecdotally the state that i'm from nebraska if i go to my city of omaha gas stations outside are like paying

(8:33) like 13 14 an hour every single place has a like now hiring sign because you just cannot find workers

(8:39) to fill a lot of these places i think that the situation is economic and i think it's like obviously so

(8:44) rather than trying to spin like a really weird nationalistic uh voter conspiracy theory thing related

(8:50) to it's not it's not conspiracy based it's completely logical a b you can't use anecdotal evidence

(8:58) when you beat up on laura southern for using anecdotal evidence so the anecdotal evidence that you're

(9:05) citing here is dismissed immediately so instead we'll focus on the facts you're saying that

(9:11) uh unemployment was low under trump because of hispanic immigration or no i'm saying it was incredibly low

(9:17) under trump below the natural rate of unemployment and that we need more workers to shore up our labor force but you don't need to

(9:24) have uh uh hispanics come in and in any other aspect than a work visa

(9:30) like japan does in order to fill uh jobs like that plus most of those jobs are low-wage

(9:35) jobs i don't know if people wanna i don't wanna make economic slaves out of them first of all it's if they're immigrating

(9:41) i imagine the economic opportunity here is probably better than where they're coming from secondly i don't think people are gonna immigrate from japan

(9:47) for low-skill low-paying jobs in the united states well i'm not saying that they will i'm saying that if you want to offer

(9:54) the low-skill low-paying jobs out to immigrants you can have a more japanese-style policy

(9:59) where you have them come into the low-skilled job and then go home i don't know why you would need to make them citizens to do that how

(10:06) unless you want unless you want your voting rolls to be uh bolstered or because we'd just rather

(10:11) have like more citizens in the united states because it bolsters our economy in a more holistic way you'd rather have people buying property here you'd rather

(10:16) have people here year-round spending money here stimulating the economy rather than just [ __ ] off for six months then that seems to be a lot more wasteful

(10:23) why do you need some type of overage of people buying property here why is that necessary well i mean i

(10:30) i mean i don't know i guess maybe we can get into an economic argument like i generally think that things that further that was your that was your argument man

(10:36) that so you're asking me why do i want like a better economy because i think that like being more economically productive is probably good

(10:42) for the united states rather than being less economically productive but it's not a matter of economic production

(10:47) necessarily that people are buying up property i don't know why that was thrown in there exactly wait what's wrong with

(10:52) people buying property i didn't say anything's wrong with it i'm just saying that i'm not sure how you can tie in people buying up

(10:59) property with a uh some type of big economic boom for the united states due to illegal immigration

(11:04) i'm saying that if people are staying here for 12 months it's probably more likely that they're going to buy property or have a permanent residence

(11:10) here than if they're moving back and forth i think that's right i think that reasonably follows did you so you think

(11:16) that uh uh essentially people need to come in here and immigrate in here buy property here

(11:22) so that they can work here because it bolsters our economy that's your your position with this or

(11:28) yeah i think it logically follows the people that move here increase the general well-being of the u.s economy being here and buying property is one

(11:33) part of that yeah and why and why would there be so much focus on the hispanic demographic which

(11:39) votes almost uh almost always in a super majority for democrats instead of having an immigration

(11:46) population from elsewhere coming in for those jobs there's plenty of other places where there are people who would

(11:52) look for what you would even consider low-wage jobs abroad i'm going to be completely honest and

(11:57) admit that my geography is really bad the last i checked though there are two countries that border the u.s one is

(12:02) canada one is mexico that probably explains where a lot of our immigrants come from maybe they come from mexico because it's

(12:08) a lot cheaper to travel and low-income workers are more likely to do that than fly across the atlantic or pacific ocean

(12:14) that would be my migrant let's earn migrant caravans traveling thousands of miles and then up through mexico lots of immigrants

(12:21) come up through that way also but i don't know what lots of is supposed to be what i'm asking is it's still probably cheaper than

(12:27) making a transcontinental flight though i'm not asking why illegals immigrate illegally out of convenience of course

(12:33) they well you did you asked me why people come more from mexico than other countries

(12:39) i'm talking about legal immigrants why would you need to import the legal immigrants from also from south of the border

(12:47) going to uh different locations worldwide unless you were trying to bolster your voter rolls

(12:54) i don't i don't understand that it makes no sense yeah i'm not sure what so are you asking me i don't know what you're asking like it

(13:00) sounds like you're asking me like why do most people come from mexico why don't they come from other countries because it's more expensive for them to immigrate here what do you mean why

(13:05) specifically why specifically are democrats importing hispanics

(13:11) it's happening it's not happening yes it's happening okay so you can say it's not happening but the demographic shift proves that it's

(13:17) happening no that's i don't think any of those words mean what you think they mean okay a demographic shift happening does not

(13:23) prove that they're being imported intentionally by some other group of people that's something that would actually say i didn't say that it proved it but

(13:28) okay you did you did just say that verbatim i am telling you that democrats specifically are importing hispanics as fast as they

(13:36) can possibly import them okay can you explain almost like almost like uh they have commodified them

(13:42) okay well all labor is commodified in the united states that's welcome to capitalism um can you explain to me what you mean

(13:47) when you say democrats are importing hispanics like maybe we find some democrats okay so democrats taylor

(13:53) specifically taylor legislation and liberals are all for it uh they tailor legislation that targets

(14:00) the hispanic community to get them on the public dole of the welfare state okay

(14:07) very rich welfare state causes all kinds of incentives for illegals to come in and for immigrants to want to come in to

(14:15) take these low-paying jobs okay as you as you put it they target them specifically with those

(14:21) incentives to come into the country are there some special incentives available to

(14:27) like just hispanic people that aren't available to other types of like refugees or illegal immigrants or legal immigrants yeah i don't know probably

(14:33) there probably are some that are don't you think that would be like a really important part of your argument for you to have that no i don't think so i think that the the

(14:40) amount that uh come in under under our current immigration policies

(14:46) pretty much bolsters the argument you don't think that might be due to the fact that we share a thousand miles a border with mexico

(14:52) well of course for illegal immigration sure legal or illegal right yeah like why do you why do you need to legally import

(14:59) no one is importing anybody okay why do you legally need to allow hispanics in

(15:05) exactly rather than have them from other sections of the earth i don't i mean i imagine we probably want immigrants to

(15:10) apply for visas or naturalization from any country depending on their economic value here right or depending on

(15:15) whatever our immigration process is i know these different types of visas different reasons to be naturalized as a citizen whether it's through marriage or

(15:22) work opportunities or special talent or whatever but yeah i don't know what you're asking me i mean we let immigrants in from all over the world i

(15:28) don't think that we like focus on hispanics there's just more people tend to cover mexico because they're right there right let's let's try to reframe it you're

(15:34) you're you seem to be a fan of hypotheticals so let me put it to you like this hypothetically okay uh if if the parties were switched

(15:41) and hispanics overwhelmingly voted for republicans uh do you think that democrats would

(15:46) have a very staunch border policy um i'm not 100 sure but that's not

(15:51) really what we're talking about right yeah i think i think it is exactly what we're talking about so when you post hypotheticals you tend

(15:57) to want direct answers and people tend to give them to you but when people post them back to you you tend to be very evasive

(16:03) okay so let me okay let me let's we'll engage this so you're asking me if if it was a bunch of republican

(16:08) potential voters that were coming in yeah and democrats were trying to block those people from immigrating then i would say yeah

(16:14) democrats are trying to block new voters that's not what i asked i asked you hypothetically if the majority of the immigrants who

(16:19) were coming in due to the immigration policies that the republican party was pushing okay and they just so happened to

(16:25) overwhelmingly vote republican do you think that democrats would suddenly be pretty uh uh pro-border security at that point

(16:34) yeah some might be sure that doesn't change my position on it at all though and it doesn't prove that they're being imported either

(16:40) they could still be coming here because of economic opportunity but the parties that decide whether they want them in or not might change based on their

(16:45) political allegiance that doesn't change why they're coming here and that doesn't mean anybody's importing them you don't think they're coming in for the social safety nets at all social

(16:52) safety nets in america no i don't think so i think they're coming here because of the labor

(16:57) opportunities for the for specifically for the labor opportunities and how many of them do you want to come in

(17:02) as many as me demand of labor and never-ending amount how many yeah it was many uh for me i'd say as many needs of demand of labor i think people should

(17:08) start themselves out like economically i think would be good and what is that going to do with the price of labor um

(17:15) probably cause it to move down a little bit and the markets that they're competitive in so so essentially the low paid skilled

(17:23) workers our unskilled workers are going to bring the labor prices down and what's that going to do

(17:28) to the low-income americans that are already here um i imagine they're gonna have to

(17:34) compete more with those wages so explain to me again why that's a good idea uh to continuously pump in

(17:41) low-income labor from south order in order to drive down the economic opportunities of the already poor

(17:47) americans we have here do you think it's a good idea that the only people that should be able to compete in america are large

(17:52) corporations like walmart why do you hate small businesses that can't afford to pay exorbitant wages to people because they have no labor pools to

(17:58) choose from do you think that small businesses shouldn't exist in america since they don't have the ability at higher taxes they can't but but that's that's a red

(18:04) herring no it's absolutely not a red herring it's absolutely correlation and i can and i can prove it to you okay go ahead are you saying that small

(18:12) businesses then rely on illegal immigrants no i'm saying that they rely more on low skill

(18:18) labor immigrant low wage labor low weight if they don't rely on immigrant labor they're saying that

(18:24) bringing in low skilled immigrants uh to meet small business demand is patently absurd sir

(18:30) how is it patently absurd because if they're not using immigrants now why do they need them they are using immigrants now they do

(18:36) okay but if they're not if i'm sorry hold on what do you what do you think happens when the price of labor increases dramatically who do you

(18:43) think is more easily and readily able to absorb the cost walmart or you know fred's fishing shop

(18:48) oh for sure the large businesses so why are you so in favor of large businesses exclusively

(18:53) ruling america is some hegemony why do you want small businesses to fail because unemployment is so absurdly low and you're refusing to allow them to

(19:00) hire workers from south of the border they'll take advantage they'll take advantage of low income labor too what do you think

(19:05) there isn't a low income labor left our unemployment

(19:12) i don't know why you're laughing when that was literally your suggestion earlier in the debate that we import them for six months and then we you said so earlier you said why don't

(19:19) we bring them in for six earlier you said why don't we bring them in for six months and send them away for the other six months he seemed to

(19:24) acknowledge what i said was if you want to have the policy of bringing in immigrant labor why not

(19:30) have something more akin to what japan has where they come in if you're trying to meet labor demands and then you send them back home i

(19:36) didn't suggest in any way shape or form that i was for that policy i only suggested that that

(19:41) policy would make a lot more sense than just letting in unfettered amounts of immigrants to meet some

(19:47) labor demand for small businesses that doesn't even exist wait you think a labor demand doesn't exist the labor demand may exist

(19:54) to a degree with small business but it's not cheap immigrant labor what kind of labor do you think small

(20:00) businesses are like all tech startups in san francisco what is a small business but a lot of them are skilled labor a

(20:05) lot of small businesses rely on on skilled labor a lot of them don't laborers yeah a lot of them don't

(20:10) but there are poor demographics here that can easily go towards those jobs

(20:17) you don't need to import the third world to take those jobs you literally okay so i understand we're kind of

(20:22) running around circles in terms of your you're crucifying your own statements here so you said that we don't need to import anybody but earlier you testify admitted you

(20:29) said well if we import people it's going to drive down wages driving down those wages is an important

(20:34) part of making it so small businesses can hire people if our unemployment in the united states is two or three percent if it's that far

(20:41) below the natural rate of unemployment those low skill wages are gonna skyrocket and you're gonna make no

(20:46) that makes no sense so you're saying that you wanna that you wanna import that you wanna import uh immigrants to

(20:53) bring wages down because that'll really stick it to the corporations then do you think that wait do you think

(20:59) wages should answer my question do you yes of course yes this is like obvious yeah to the

(21:04) corporation do you think that wages should be infinitely high corporations are the ones like big farms who rely on immigrant

(21:10) labor now illegal immigrant labor you think that the best way to stick it to corporate america

(21:16) is by just importing as much of the third world as we possibly can and you think that that's an argument that makes sense there's a reason why

(21:23) companies like amazon when they had a little bit of political pressure were quick to enact a 15 an hour a corporate wide minimum rate

(21:30) wage and why mom and pop shops across america would have to close business if they were forced to do the same

(21:35) so the reason why small business owners aren't able to keep up with labor markets that are they're getting priced out of when the labor

(21:41) gets more and more and more expensive this is something that happens when uh when you have a very very very low rate of unplanned i know

(21:47) it sounds good for you to keep constantly saying like you want to drive down wages you want to drive down wages

(21:54) rates with minimum wages you're you're arbitrarily setting a market rate

(22:00) with immigration do you not realize what's the market rate going to be then without it if you if you

(22:05) restrict immigration the exact precise number of the market rate you want or what liberals have suggested with a

(22:11) 15 an hour minimum wage what's the market rate going to be without low wage workers you have no idea

(22:17) you have no idea it's going to be way higher than what it is now potentially i have no idea uh

(22:24) for for certain what the wage is going to be yes the the the wage will likely be

(22:30) higher based on demand that's a good thing is it always a good thing should wages just be infinitely

(22:35) high no they shouldn't be infinitely high so do you think a wage could be two do you think a wage could be based around the

(22:42) population that you have though okay so let's say that unemployment would have dropped to one percent or half a percent

(22:47) do you think then that where fast food chains are having to hire workers for 20 an hour do you think that's an ideal world what do you do at that point no

(22:54) and i don't think that we were in that world we were getting there we were both i don't know we weren't getting there and look are

(23:00) you saying without without the the economic

(23:05) importation of labor okay you're saying that that uh low-skilled workers are going to have a

(23:12) higher wage but then you argue against that by saying but you want to drive wages down

(23:17) because that'll really stick it to amazon my goal i'm not saying you drive down wages to

(23:23) stick it to amazon what i'm saying is that settling on a good wage is vital not

(23:28) only for small businesses that employ people it's also vital for customers that buy goods and services

(23:33) because if wages are going massively up because we don't have the labor force to actually staff these businesses then one

(23:39) new firms can't create because there are no people to hire you've got no pool labor and two the existing cost of all the labor is going

(23:45) to start to go up and up and up which is going to drive up the cost of goods and services which is going to inhibit people's ability to participate in the

(23:50) economy it's like super it's a pretty big it's not we're not even like at an argument point yet like this is all just obviously true

(23:56) if you have very very few words it's not obviously true and the premise i reject completely

(24:01) which part of that do you reject okay so one more time your uh

(24:07) your basic argument was that immigrant labor was good and it's good because it drives

(24:15) down wages which is bad for corporate america

(24:20) no okay i'm just that's what you said though okay i'm sorry let me try this one more time okay

(24:26) okay immigrant labor is good because when our unemployment is getting below the natural rate of unemployment it

(24:33) implies that wages are going to start to move incredibly high because there aren't enough workers for the economy

(24:39) when we don't have enough workers for the economy the people that bear the brunt of that are going to be low income people

(24:46) because the cost of goods and service is going to increase and it's going to be small business owners that's the full argument but what about

(24:52) the low income people's wages what they're not they're probably

(24:57) what's going to happen is that those firms are probably eventually just going to shut down they're not going to pay somebody twenty-five dollars an hour to

(25:03) flip burgers because there's no workers what mcdonald's sure franchise mcdonald's will shut down because they

(25:09) can't hire enough high school kids either that or they'll just start automating more and more of the labor force

(25:14) i don't know the last time you've been in mcdonald's but a lot more of those jobs are automated now than they used to be and some of them they don't look very automated to me

(25:20) they still look like cashiers they still look like cooks in the back oh crazy okay well and some of the ones that i've been in now even in the united

(25:26) states there aren't cashiers anymore there's literally there are some people that stand at the front where were you in the united states were you walking in

(25:31) california i've seen it in california i've seen it in oh my god what do you want like my

(25:36) address no i just want you to tell me whereabouts in california automated you walk into a mcdonald's and you don't

(25:43) even interact with the cashier you just put the order in on the screen you've never seen these in the us before i'm asking you where you saw one because

(25:49) you when you use an arbitrary generalization like that it makes me think that you might be you know not telling the truth okay hold

(25:55) on i just want to be clear here so you're challenging me on the idea that in the united states there exists mcdonald's where the order

(26:02) taking process is fully automated no that's not what you said you said that automation was going to squeeze out

(26:08) the workers and i want to know where there's fully automated mcdonald's it's not fully automated from front to back but there are parts of the job that

(26:15) are going to be and you can push some buttons to select your order and then somebody makes it and brings it out to you

(26:20) yes yeah okay what do you do okay that's not that's not job killing tech that is a job what do you mean that's a job of

(26:27) somebody okay who will take those jobs and somebody still has to fix that machine

(26:32) go ahead who's to somebody that's gonna fix the machine is it gonna be those low-skilled workers you talk about or is it going to be a college educated person

(26:38) coming from india or japan oftentimes the more advanced machinery gets the more modulated it gets so yeah

(26:43) low-skilled workers can do a lot of those jobs and as you get into the future you'll find more machinery is modulated

(26:51) you think the modulated machinery that exists today you you i just i'm just wanna this is

(26:56) fascinating to me now hold on because i'm learning a lot now you think the modulated machinery that exists today is being worked on by people with high

(27:02) school education because it's so modulated yes okay where where wait where where where is this

(27:08) happening yeah where where is this happening uh you can look at companies like international gaming

(27:14) technology and the lottery machines that you see in your gas stations and all of these different types of uh of

(27:20) machines that are out there and go look at the job requirements for them or the education requirements for them and

(27:27) you'll find that the education requirement is quite low because a lot of the machinery that's

(27:32) out there now is it's module based and by the way that trend has been going on especially in the military for many

(27:40) many many years you just take the module throw it behind your shoulder put the new module right

(27:45) in you don't need hardly any skill to do it at all do you think there's going to be as many jobs available there as there

(27:51) were at the front line for employees i have no idea it's hard to say well what do you okay well let's

(27:56) let's pretend to determine what no it's actually super easy it's common sense logical follow-up but it's not common i

(28:03) hate to say i hate to use that term i hate to use that term but like let's pretend that we're a business owner okay

(28:08) let's pretend we're a business owner and we're gonna automate a job by making hypotheticals again yeah sure i love hypotheticals let's see

(28:15) what business owner do you do let me let him finish talking all right do you think that a a firm

(28:23) that has an employee is going to automate that job if it's going to cost them more to do it

(28:28) no okay so that reduction in in in cost and outlays right for

(28:34) labor what does that mean if they're paying less for work

(28:39) it means there's gonna be less wages paid right that's sure in this in this particular

(28:45) hypothetical not in this particular hypothetical that's how a firm makes it no you just said that this was a hypothetical

(28:51) so i answered to the hypothetical but now you're saying no this applies nationwide or what

(28:57) so you so you think that real life firms let's leave a hybrid you think real life businesses are

(29:02) automating jobs and then paying more to have them automated no i don't think that they're paying more to have them automated so they're

(29:09) probably less necessarily saying that all the forms of automation are job-killing forms of automation either

(29:14) and nor do i think that bringing in massive quantities of cheap labor when you're saying automation is that advanced why would

(29:21) you want to continue to bring in cheap labor makes no sense because then because the typically the firms that can afford the

(29:27) automation are going to be like the larger businesses so this is going to be hurting your smaller businesses but you wanted to stick it to the larger

(29:33) businesses i don't know why you keep saying i want to stick it i love large business i know what you mean i want to stick it to the

(29:38) larger businesses so now so now you like like large corporate interests large businesses

(29:44) i've never really stated this is like your little rhetorical trick that you're trying to say i want to stick it to large but i was just explaining what

(29:49) will happen if unemployment gets too low and wages go too high small businesses go out of business and large businesses are more

(29:55) easily able to absorb the cost i never said whether that was going to be you're the one that's these of low-wage hispanic workers that's

(30:00) they don't i mean it could be that like white people make a ton of babies or it could be that a ton of people from canada come in or could be the people

(30:06) other people here start making more i mean technically the workers could come from any place it just seems so so did you want to move on to the

(30:12) birth rate then that's why we move on to the birth rate if you want i'm just saying that low school labor or low-cost labor coming from the south

(30:19) like dramatically props up like large sections of the u.s economy in the south this is incredibly important to shore up our labor markets

(30:24) i don't think that's a very controversial statement and you not even being willing to admit you not even being willing to admit that

(30:30) when firms automate labor it's to save money you're like too scared to even admit that shows you you know you're probably

(30:37) and i agreed with you that within the confines of that hypothetical that would be correct okay then i don't know why you're trying

(30:43) to make the argument that more jobs are going to be available when you automate like machinery when the fact is they're not going to

(30:49) automate machinery just to pay out more in labor that's the reason why you automate is to get away from that they could pay out less in labor but new form

(30:55) new firms will likely develop in order to service that type of equipment and the more modular that equipment is

(31:00) the more jobs are created that's how that works but ultimately what those what those new firms are going to be are

(31:05) going to be restricted to what the initial firm is willing to pay out to automate whatever job it is they're

(31:10) not going to automate a job that was paying 30 000 a year for a hundred thousand a year so all these new industries

(31:16) okay so it's not that me you keep saying that me this is what logically follows what you're saying i'm trying to show you the contradiction in your statements

(31:21) there's no there's no controversial contradiction as as as we've stated or as you've stated multiple times you

(31:28) you want to you're talking about both sides of your mouth you're saying that you want to import immigrants because you want to

(31:35) keep wages low for larger firms i don't want to keep wages look i'm saying okay i'll do it

(31:41) one more time okay i want it yeah more labor needs to come in because right now we are below the

(31:47) natural rate of unemployment we should probably be at around five percent if we get above that we need monetary policy to move us back

(31:54) if we get below that we need more labor force that's typically how things work okay

(32:00) got it cool what's the next part well i don't you had you had brought up

(32:05) birth rates um sure what about them guessing that that's part of your immigration argument

(32:10) is that people here aren't having enough babies yeah it seems like a problem around the world that this country's industrialized and everything people just tend to have

(32:16) less and less children in most places and would you agree with me then uh with the statement that generally

(32:22) the more advanced uh civilization gets the lower the birth rates generally tend to become yeah that seems to be the case and most

(32:28) people that seems to be the trend uh my my question with this

(32:34) is always the same which is why wouldn't you incentivize your own population to have babies

(32:40) instead of importing the populations from elsewhere my understanding is that that's just never been done successfully

(32:46) [Music] so i believe um it was under mussolini

(32:52) in italy i think that they they tried a huge program where they were massively incentivizing people to have children

(32:57) they were offering money for it i think they were having favorable work positions for their own time they tried so much and they just

(33:02) couldn't budget at all um how long was mussolini in power um

(33:08) i don't know the exact years i'm not sure actually but i know that they tried it i think is

(33:13) japan trying it as well uh well japan's uh starting to japan has

(33:18) a cultural issue with their with their birth rate has to do with the herbivore men it's my understanding but

(33:23) that aside are herbivores not able to have children or well no herbivore is a term that they

(33:29) use there for men who basically swear off women oh gotcha also mussolini was in power for 20 years so okay right

(33:36) when did that policy when was it i don't know exactly when that policy okay well i'm just saying that you have to give policies for birth rates

(33:42) probably a longer time than a few years in order to see um if they're going to

(33:47) work one and two you say that this is never when it's

(33:53) been tried it's never been successful but only pointing out one country uh

(33:59) that was uh under mussolini probably isn't the uh the best overriding example so i have no

(34:07) idea um at all that uh that offering economic

(34:13) incentives to the population wouldn't work great and i think it was don't we already do that in the united states

(34:19) not really don't have a big child how about something like giving a moratorium to people who have you know two or three children on the

(34:26) income tax what does what do you mean by moratorium they don't pay the income tax i mean a

(34:32) lot of people that take like those child tax credits already don't pay income tax right depending on true that's true but it doesn't seem

(34:38) like it's incentivizing to have a lot more kids people generally aren't the people we have to worry about not having children either they're still breeding

(34:43) plenty who are you trying to incentivize to have children generally the higher you go up the economic scale

(34:48) the more the family planning more family planning there is and the less people tend to have children so do you think you're going to

(34:55) be able to convince like wealthy successful people to just start becoming children factories if you offer them enough tax incentive

(35:00) yeah especially on the income tax i do i think that they absolutely would why

(35:06) wouldn't they because they have bigger drives in life than being children factories would be my guess

(35:12) i don't okay so it's not like money right now is preventing them from making more kids but people people people right now yeah

(35:19) it is it's a monetary barrier the the child barrier is a monastery no no okay let's let's think right here for

(35:24) not having kids and why they're planning families it's for one reason one reason only money can you okay can you explain this

(35:30) to me because i'm i'm just i'm too slow so you just told me that the higher up you go in income

(35:36) the less likely you are to have more children how does that point to it being an economic problem

(35:42) because the higher you go up in income the less likely you are to have to now we're talking about a gradual scale man

(35:49) no no hold on let's try this one more time you told me that there are economic barriers to having children but earlier you stated the higher you go

(35:55) up in income the less likely are to have children that seems to me at a point to the fact that it's not an economic

(36:00) problem it's not a financial barrier it's another decision being made no it is a it is exactly uh

(36:08) uh an economic issue because people who want savings and people who want to do long-term

(36:15) family planning they're generally in what you would consider the middle class or the lower

(36:20) middle class people who have nothing have nothing to risk if this was planning for them uh is not of much

(36:28) consequence if this was true then why wouldn't the wealthiest people in society be having

(36:33) lots of children what do you mean you're telling me that

(36:39) people would be having more kids if they had the financial means to do so then why wouldn't the wealthiest people in

(36:44) society i don't know maybe they are the people having the most children i don't know i don't have the stats on you

(36:49) literally earlier in this conversation quoted me the stats saying that the wealthier you were the less likely you were to have a lot of children or you go

(36:56) up the income scale yeah yes so why wouldn't those people be having we're talking about a gradual income

(37:02) scale here we're not talking about a jump from ten dollars an hour to ten million yeah it could be gradually however you want it talking about a jump

(37:09) from uh you know ten dollars an hour to thirty dollars an hour it's in that income scale that you're

(37:14) generally seeing the white middle class not having children because of economic barriers i'm just saying that like it seems to me

(37:21) that if we were saying that economic barriers were preventing people from having kids it seems like at the bottom of the income

(37:27) there would be the least kids and then as you go up and up and up there would be more the fact that you look at the scale well

(37:32) no it doesn't depend on how you look at it it's completely different it's depend on how you look at the scale depends it depends on how you look

(37:38) there's not that many wealthy people to pull from we have plenty of wealthy people who's more likely to have a child who's more

(37:43) likely to multiple children upper middle class people or lower working class people probably lower working class people why i thought

(37:50) economic barriers were the big thing keeping people from having children it is the big thing keeping them then why are poorer people having more kids

(37:56) from having children because of family planning basically the higher up in the education scale you go also

(38:02) the less children you're going to have the more that you do family planning that's the way that that works you keep

(38:07) saying family planning i don't know what i'm like okay do you have children yeah i've got one yeah

(38:13) okay gotcha so uh would you rather have be in a position when you have that child to be uh

(38:20) you know monetarily sound or would you rather be in a position when you have that child monetarily sound but if

(38:26) everybody made decisions that way then why are poor people having more children because they don't care they don't have

(38:32) anything to lose okay then why are wealthy people not having more children and it's also based can you answer that

(38:39) question before we get into the racial [ __ ] please why aren't wealthy people having more children why don't upper middle class

(38:45) and rich people have more children because they're doing family planning what do you mean when you say family planning what do you

(38:51) think that means okay so in order to reach that scale of upper middle class or middle class or

(38:57) whatever it usually takes time and people want to be established before they start having families

(39:03) this is something that uh is very common in the white racial demographic not so

(39:09) common in the black racial demographic and not so common in the hispanic racial demographic

(39:14) why do you think that's the case i don't know why that's the case except for the uh economic barriers that

(39:22) are there or because they maybe look at things differently than than how whites do depends maybe how you

(39:29) were raised i have no idea exactly why that is i don't know how to get through this point where you're telling

(39:34) me there are economic barriers that prevent people from having children and then you're saying like middle class people quote unquote family

(39:41) plan and lower class people don't and rich people just don't have like you're the only other way to look at the data would be

(39:46) to look at it upside down like i don't know how your data your data is completely contraindicative of what

(39:51) you're trying to say one more time it's based along racial demographics it's based for long education levels

(39:58) it's based on income levels you're only looking at one scale i am okay so let's move to the other one so let's look at education levels

(40:05) i'm willing to bet now i could be wrong because i haven't looked at it no i have like this data but the higher educated you are are you

(40:12) more likely or less likely to have a child probably less likely so what's the solution to that then

(40:19) uh probably incentives probably kind of incentives would give a tax moratorium that would

(40:26) be probably priority number one you got to remember how much professionals pay out in income taxes

(40:31) it's quite a lot and i think that if you gave them a moratorium on income tax that they would be more than happy

(40:37) to be one of them baby factories as you call them okay why would they need a moratorium on income tax if they wouldn't be working

(40:43) because they'd be too busy producing children well they wouldn't be too busy producing children

(40:49) what do you mean i uh a married a married couple if if you look at the woman's income and

(40:55) the male's income it's very possible that uh if you gave him an income tax

(41:01) break the female wouldn't have to work at all she could stay home with her kids so you would essentially be completely

(41:08) subsidizing 100 any potential lost income from the woman if she was the one that wanted to stay home and take care of the children

(41:14) oh sure and a government subsidy to bolster the population would be just fine if it stopped uh uh the

(41:22) massive immigration from the third world here okay well i don't see a problem with that sure i think if we're going to spend our

(41:28) own population instead of giving all that social safety net money to immigrants from the third world that makes no sense to me so rather than

(41:35) wasting all this money and this weird plan to try to pay people to become baby factories i think i would rather just

(41:40) like incentivize the people that immigrate from the south to come here and be contributing to the united states economy in that way

(41:46) i don't have a better plan than incentivizing the domestic population because you're literally talking about because you're literally talking about

(41:52) people that might have the skills or qualifications to pursue higher education you're talking about blocking them from entering our

(41:58) workforce some of the most productive labor that we have in order to produce babies because you don't want people coming here from another country so your

(42:04) solution to that instead is to import low-skilled migrant workers

(42:09) uh in order to take care of the lack of population my i'm not trying to import anybody i

(42:15) just think that people should be able to sort themselves out economically as they see fit and i don't want to take some of our most productive workers and turn them

(42:21) into baby factories because you're scared of hispanic immigrants it's not a fear of anything then why do

(42:28) you care so much if they come in and do work rather than paying i don't care if it's a hispanic or a black person

(42:33) well you seem to care because you were really upset that they were coming from mexico wait if the hispanic or black person who's an

(42:39) american is getting the incentive that's fine with me wait why did you why is it that okay sure why is it that

(42:44) earlier you were so invested in having people immigrate from other countries instead of mexico no it wasn't that i was invested i was

(42:51) asking you about your positions my position is i think people should economically start taking a stand on

(42:56) them why do you want them from only this

(43:01) demographic that happens to vote for democrats and am i do you remember my response was why did i want them from mexico do you

(43:07) remember my response it was convenient yeah because it's closer exactly that seemed to be a non-satisfactory answer to you

(43:12) it's convenient to let them jump in line from everybody else it had nothing to do at all with the

(43:18) fact that they just so happened to vote for your party overwhelmingly has nothing to do with that that's a conspiracy theory

(43:23) that's your story and you're sticking to it you also didn't say that you wanted to import them and you are importing them

(43:30) no i don't know what you think importing means but we're in order to make sure that

(43:35) uh um small businesses can economically compete with large corporations you're

(43:41) going to stick it to the to the corporations by uh uh allowing the mass migration

(43:46) from from the south that's that's your basic position on this do you think that when you repeat like really big slogans

(43:52) or buzzwords like stick it to the corporations or import workers are these things that are supposed to bolster your argument or

(43:58) bolster your optics because i can't know if you're talking to me or a hypothetical audience that's waiting for you to hear like a slogan over and over and

(44:04) over again things to say because you said them okay so i've never said i want to import workers ever and i've never said i want

(44:10) to stick it to corporations instead i think i described the concept that you were unfamiliar with before this conversation which was the natural rate

(44:16) of unemployment which is fair a lot of people don't know anything about unemployment which is strange because you guys bragged about it so much under trump and

(44:22) so for some reason you keep grabbing onto these like import worker things or you keep bringing in this like uh

(44:28) stick it to the corporations thing because i was just describing to you like basic economic principle that like hey like larger corporation come on come on

(44:34) i think you finish every point let him finish let me just finish one point okay all i did was i made the

(44:39) point that when wages sharply rise because you're running out of workers small businesses are going to be hurt

(44:45) before large corporations and it seems like in america we value our small business culture and one way to look after them is to make sure

(44:51) that enough labor is provided to them for them to work now for some reason you keep trying to flip this as you want to stick it to the

(44:56) corporations which isn't anything that i've said i've never said anything about sticking it to the corporations and i've also never said anything you

(45:02) you keep strumming and it's over you're saying i want to import workers i don't want to import anybody if nobody from mexico wants to come and work here

(45:08) they don't have to that's fine then we solve our problems in other ways maybe it does end up being some crazy uh baby factory incentivization program

(45:14) like you're saying but as long as there are people willing to come into this country and work in these cheaper jobs i would rather

(45:19) have them sort themselves out like that economically than pay some of our smarter smartest and brightest people

(45:24) to not go to college and not contribute in our economy in a positive way because you want them to make babies because for some reason you don't want an immigrant

(45:30) coming in and filling the job no what i said was that if that is your position that you're worried about the

(45:35) birth rates domestically that you should give incentives to the population in order to increase the birth rates

(45:41) that's my position on that okay two you are making the argument if you're saying

(45:47) that you want low skilled worker workers to come in in order to make sure that small

(45:52) businesses which you value can compete with the the evil large corporations which you don't seem to value much okay

(46:01) that i think i don't value large corporations well i don't know you you you seem to

(46:06) you seem to be going after the wanting of low-skilled uh workers for for some bizarre reason

(46:12) thinking that that's going to make small businesses competitive with large corporations because it helps them be competitive because the labor's cheaper we want more

(46:18) competition in a market generally right yeah but but the thing is is like so for

(46:23) unskilled jobs right there's plenty there's plenty of americans who can take the unskilled jobs there were plenty of america yeah so i i

(46:31) just i don't know what to say um you there weren't plenty of americans to do it are you the u3 unemployment was three and a half percent maybe three and

(46:37) a quarter i think in some in some states it got below three percent there's just not the americans for these jobs so everybody's wages are high

(46:43) everybody's making money that's a good thing you don't need to have in uh never-ending growth it's not necessary

(46:50) gotcha okay so i'm so normally this is where i would just start and say okay but i have to explain the other end so it's not good

(46:56) because when the wage prices start to get dramatically jacked up at the lower end right that like that what happens is is

(47:01) all of those like lower skilled jobs end up getting automated all of the costs of those goods and services end up increasing which disproportionately

(47:07) hurts lower workers the most and then capital is more largely allocated and more largely focused

(47:12) on wealthier people as smaller businesses go under when that happens so that's why it's bad so so so automation automation is

(47:21) the uh the reason then that we need to have the low-skilled workers come in from south of the border

(47:26) essentially it can be one of the reasons yeah sure okay got it is there a part of that you

(47:32) don't understand because i can explain it to you if you'd like me to yeah no no by all means explain it sure so lower skill

(47:37) low wage labor jobs are easier to automate than higher skilled ones as the cost of that low skilled waiver

(47:43) labor increases eventually automation is going to be preferred there's going to be some cost of labor where it becomes too costly and

(47:49) you'd rather just automate the job once that job is automated then that the lower skill job doesn't exist anymore

(47:55) and instead less overall labor is paid out to what is ultimately going to be a higher skill job like an engineer

(48:01) theoretically um sure theoretically i guess it's possible that maybe a firm automates the jobs and pays

(48:07) more for it because they're owners well i'm asking you where all the low-wage workers were squeezed out by automation because why would we need to

(48:14) import them we need to import people because we don't have the workers for our

(48:19) low-skilled jobs what do you mean okay but you just said that if the wages

(48:25) of the low-skilled workers continuously go up okay that companies are going to replace them with

(48:31) automation but clearly that can't be a problem right now if you're wanting to continuously

(48:37) import the third world to do low-skilled jobs you understand that makes no sense sure it's not like yeah all the jobs

(48:44) haven't been replaced yet but if that trend is is theoretically no no there

(48:50) happened so first of all it has begun to happen there are places that are automating low-skilled jobs because you

(48:56) went to a mcdonald's and you could sell order once do you do you really believe that

(49:01) there's not like a large do you want to ship your articles on this or oh i know i know tons about automation man i've been in the field for years

(49:07) i don't believe you i don't i don't think that i don't think that's true it's true it's it's true and it's verifiable and i'll send you proof if

(49:14) you promise to apologize when i do so you don't think that i couldn't show

(49:19) you evidence right now that say mcdonald's has been implementing more than before i'm not saying that there's not some

(49:25) mcdonald's that have kiosks fine what i'm saying though is that you can't have the contrarian position

(49:32) that you need to continuously import this labor that's low skilled because automation if you don't

(49:39) the the the good paying jobs that are low skilled right now are going to get squeezed out via automation when clearly that's not

(49:46) what's going on if you still are needing to import the low skilled labor well the idea is you the idea is you

(49:52) continue to make sure there's some liquidity in those labor markets so that you don't have to automate every job but if it

(49:57) continues at three and a half percent unemployment eventually you would expect to see all of those jobs become automated and then those people would be out of

(50:03) work opportunities and then they would become unemployed and eventually we'd settle out at five percent and show me the examples where that's

(50:08) happened um sure here's a forbes article i mean like if you want of like mcdonald's uh

(50:14) increasing their automation show me an example of low unemployment leading to automation squeezing out all the low income labor

(50:22) um sure so as part of this article is minimum wage levels approach or surpass 15 nationwide restaurant customers

(50:28) expecting to be greeted by smiling face will instead be welcomed by a glowing led screen as of 2020 self-service ordering kiosks

(50:35) will be implemented at all u.s mcdonald's locations other chains including fast casual brands like panera and casual dining

(50:41) brands like chili's have already embraced this trend so one more time can you give me

(50:49) examples of countries or or anything how much more do you want

(50:54) to run this back let's just what's the next topic wait let's just let's just do the next topic okay give me an example of unemployment going

(51:00) down under three percent okay automation coming in squeezing out the entire industry

(51:07) or or even large sections of the industry because a mcdonald's kiosk ain't getting you there man

(51:12) an led screen at a mcdonald's isn't getting you to the we need to have lots and lots and lots of hispanics come

(51:19) in to take care of low-wage jobs i'm sorry but it's not

(51:25) i i i'm not sure what to say i mean like to you those jobs might not mean anything but to somebody that was working a cash register that's now

(51:30) unemployed like i mean they lost a job but i mean if you don't care that's fine i guess we're all on the internet so [ __ ] them at the end of the day right

(51:36) certain select locations where now the high school kid can't take care of the registers in certain select locations or in all locations

(51:42) as of 2020 self-service ordering kiosks will be implemented at all u.s mcdonald's locations and other chains

(51:48) were included in the scent as well when as of 2020 is what they're doing when 2020.

(51:54) i don't know we're in what we're in 2021 okay so

(52:01) did automation come on in well anybody that would have had a job at mcdonald's

(52:06) working at a cash register no longer has that job right now you're saying right now at

(52:11) mcdonald's nation why this is the case i mean if the articles are true sure okay but clearly that's not the case

(52:19) what do you mean that's not the case the people that face that you can go in and self-order at every mcdonald's in the united states

(52:25) it's not the case that say that again it's not the case that you can go into an order from a self-order kiosk

(52:31) everywhere in the united states i don't know when the robot is going to be done well according to the article it was supposed to be 2020

(52:37) is when they're starting the rollout so if you click through to the usa today article it says that they are adding

(52:44) kiosks to a thousand stores every quarter roughly 10 stores per day over the next two years so and maybe in two years it'll be done then i guess by 2022

(52:50) is that does that make you feel better okay so again the 8 hour high school kid won't be able to work behind the

(52:56) register at the mcdonald's and this is your proof that automation's going to squeeze out all the low-skilled jobs and

(53:02) so we just absolutely must continue to import hispanic workers in order to keep the labor prices down

(53:08) so that we can so that small businesses can economically compete with large corporations so i understand i understand so i'm i'm

(53:15) sorry but like i understand that we're all like on the internet and wealthy and we don't give a [ __ ] about like i guess what normal people do for work or whatever

(53:22) but it's not just high school workers that work these jobs it's not just kids in high school that aren't being employed now at

(53:27) mcdonald's or other people that rely on this type of work and other work that gets automated uh in order to survive

(53:32) like i don't know why you keep trying to drive there but you want to drive their wages down is what you're saying

(53:38) if they could be getting there's two options they could either be driven down to ten dollars an hour and get paid to work

(53:44) or they can go up to 16 an hour and not get paid anything because they can pay a robot to do it for 40. this is assuming that you think that

(53:49) automation is advanced enough to take care of a lot of low-skilled jobs that it really can't take uh take care of one example of that very

(53:57) easy right off the top of my head is construction work okay what robots are going to take over construction work

(54:04) that's not going to happen in your lifetime so you don't think that there are any construction jobs that are being more automated today than they were

(54:11) 50 years ago i doubt it they have like machines that lay like

(54:16) entire [ __ ] like concrete paths and [ __ ] now automatically whereas you used to have people that would like like you can literally

(54:22) [ __ ] 3d print houses now i don't understand how you can say something but that's not common hold on

(54:28) just to be clear this is like one of the worst examples that you could ever use okay so so you're saying that uh there's

(54:35) price effective machines for small businesses that they can get that will go in and lay entire tile

(54:41) floors for them or what sure and and the more cost the more the higher that lab

(54:46) the higher the labor gets the more likely it is that people will begin to automate what we're approaching it at

(54:51) some point i can throw you an article from the i mean like i didn't i didn't actually think we're going to argue this because it's just like not a point you can

(54:57) really argue again so study finds nearly half of jobs are vulnerable to automation like this is just nobody's serious actually will argue

(55:02) this i don't know i don't know i'm arguing it because the premise is flawed and it's tied into your immigration

(55:08) arguments okay well here's an article by the economist i don't know if you consider them biased or not so number one was food preparation guess what number

(55:14) two on their list is for vulnerable to be construct uh to to be automated is construction and over 50 of construction jobs vulnerable to

(55:20) automation production what forms of construction floor lane are you going to you're going to stay here and expect to be an like an expert in every single

(55:27) example i bring up like i'm not going to be able to tell you the ins and outs of every single part of wait hold on let me finish hold on i let you finish your thing i let you finish

(55:33) your things okay this this little like debate tactic uh when i bring something up you ask me like oh yeah

(55:38) you think mcdonald's did this well tell me what the manager's name is i bet you don't even know his niece i bet you can't even tell me in construction can you tell me the the

(55:45) type of unit that's like i don't know the answer in depth to all of these things i didn't come here prepared to debate

(55:50) whether or not the increasing cost of labor is going to lead to more automation because that's nothing nobody debates that

(55:56) it's almost it's like a logical necessity of course that'll happen if you want we can come back in the future and i could bring people on from

(56:02) construction or i could do more research and construction and tell you and show you how a lot of these jobs get automated away but no i don't work in construction

(56:09) and i'm not prepared to have an in-depth conversation with you about the different types of like efficient capital that are available today in

(56:14) construction markets calm down man you're getting mad i'm super calm right now hispanics hispanics low-wage hispanic workers who

(56:23) are working on roofs okay and 110 degrees laying down tar are not going to have their jobs replaced

(56:30) by robots in your lifetime not that are affordable to small businesses it's not going to

(56:36) happen and it's absurd big giant you can point to a big giant franchise like mcdonald's

(56:42) that can afford to implement robots okay but your argument is that you don't like the

(56:47) mcdonald's you want the small businesses to be able to compete with the mcdonald's and that the best way for them to be

(56:54) able to do that is to import i don't know why you said i don't like mcdonald's okay

(56:59) fine you like you you keep like loading you're trying to like you want small businesses to be able to

(57:04) compete against mcdonald's yeah there you go okay so the thing is is that by mcdonald's automating the small

(57:10) businesses gets the get the workers yeah but by say that again repeat that last

(57:16) problem if mcdonald's puts in the kiosk and fires the high school kid they go work at the burger journal why do you think

(57:21) why do you think mcdonald's only hires high school kids can you tell me that okay fine the single mom okay so okay so

(57:28) there we go thank you we're getting a little bit more honest so we fire the single mom that is no longer working out of place okay then what happens

(57:36) then she goes according to your economic logic she goes down to the local burger joint um and gets a job at the local small

(57:43) business burger joint because the big corporation just got rid of her and uh

(57:48) you know we want to keep uh we want to keep wages low uh so that small businesses you keep

(57:53) saying we want to keep wages low do you think we should keep wages as high as possible why do you keep saying that why are you only looking at one end of the equation

(57:59) because that's what your argument was again no no but you're not taught if i was having an intelligent argument

(58:05) about economics then i would accept that but you're trying to frame it as though i'm trying to hurt workers by keeping their wages low

(58:11) the wages are hurting workers keep by keeping their weight yeah so i'm asking you are you in favor of like a sure so are

(58:16) you in favor of like a 25 an hour minimum wage no why do you want to keep wages low i don't want any type of government

(58:22) minimum wage why do you want to keep wages low the market can take care of wages your own argument is saying that that's

(58:28) what's going on you don't want the market to take care of wages so you want to arbitrarily restrict the labor force in order to make wages rise

(58:34) it's not being it's arbitrary not allowing in immigration that's ridiculous it is

(58:40) true what you're trying to do is flood the market so you're trying to manipulate wages not

(58:46) me no i just want people to settle themselves out economically no that's how that's how the market should

(58:51) function somebody wants to move somewhere because there's a job available for him then god bless him or buddha bless him or whoever whatever

(58:58) your preferred deity is okay so um we can probably start to head

(59:04) into the q and a portion if you guys want or or you guys can wind it down um i'm not

(59:10) sure if there's more you guys want to go into on this or not

(59:15) do but um i'm good i appreciate you being a good sport and humoring me ma'am yeah i think we're good yeah so okay so

(59:23) let's see what we have um here with questions um

(59:28) let's see what is this one uh why should we spend on tax incentives to make and

(59:35) to make new babies when there is already immigrant labor ready and willing to work and pay taxes instead

(59:43) well because it's always a good idea for your domestic population uh to have already

(59:51) already available jobs that are that are available to them and i don't think it's a good idea to be

(59:58) importing cheap labor and uh keeping keeping wages down that way i don't i don't think it's a good

(1:00:04) idea i think that the more that we can incentivize our domestic population the better it's good for the black population it's

(1:00:10) good for the white population it's good it's good for us period okay

(1:00:15) so from warren for destiny wages have been stagnant since 1973 why why would we not want to market

(1:00:22) demand to raise wages instead of importing oh legals to keep wages down the idea that wages have

(1:00:28) been stagnant for 40 or 50 years is like the the way that you get at this number is through a really weird manipulation

(1:00:34) of the data when you actually sort out like productivity versus overall compensation by industry

(1:00:39) for the most part the wages have been a little bit lower than what they should be but the compensation is keeping up a lot better than people seem to think it

(1:00:45) is the idea that wages have been completely stagnant is based on like a weird usage of the cpi and like not disaggregating

(1:00:51) different like sectors from each other okay um destiny is america to you more

(1:00:58) than just a labor market um sure america is a lot of things i i

(1:01:03) don't know exactly what i don't think america is just not allowing immigrants in but i think he's

(1:01:09) saying that there's more to it than just the labor cost and that we should look at the societal

(1:01:16) impact of immigration on top of it that's how i took that what is the societal impact

(1:01:22) i i don't know uh you know basically the massive quantity of hispanics

(1:01:29) that vote for one voting bloc um and the disenfranchisement of the

(1:01:35) locals by that happening is a big problem i think yeah so i just don't you don't have any

(1:01:41) right in the united states to maintain a voter block in a community um the idea that like no one can move in

(1:01:46) anywhere because they might change the voting bloc or foreigners can't move in because they change the voting blocks just fundamentally not how this country

(1:01:52) works so i don't know why anybody would think yeah but on the other hand a select group of people keeping uh and maintaining a specific voting block

(1:01:58) for the purposes of power is a subversion of democracy so there's that uh yeah that was

(1:02:04) happening i would agree yeah yeah well that's happening so okay so from so we have to andrew why does angie

(1:02:11) think rich people would start producing kids if money isn't what's stopping them from having kids in

(1:02:17) the first place okay so we already covered that but one more time okay i'm not there's more factors that

(1:02:25) go into it than just the money but for the most part if we're talking about a labor

(1:02:31) issue okay we want to be incentivizing as many children as we possibly can

(1:02:38) in order to take care of that issue if that's what your argument is for wanting to flood the market with

(1:02:43) lots and lots of cheap immigrant labor okay so andrew would you support closing

(1:02:48) off borders regardless of the economic cost if tax incentives don't cause a growth

(1:02:54) in birth rates nationally would you keep your position i think i think that i would have to change it

(1:02:59) at that point but you would you would have to give it enough time to work

(1:03:05) i don't know how much time it would take for something like that to work necessarily but i think it needs to be done okay

(1:03:12) so for andrew if i can pay a worker 40k a year to take orders at a register when i can pay 5k

(1:03:20) one time why wouldn't i nobody's making 40k a year at a register man

(1:03:26) um do we already do this one uh do you expect the more economically and educated

(1:03:32) population to fill the low-skilled jobs no

(1:03:38) okay um why would shrinking the economy benefit the u.s it wouldn't necessarily

(1:03:46) benefit the u.s but on the it depends on which metric you're looking at

(1:03:51) depends on which metric you're looking at which metric would it be beneficial in in which way you're saying it

(1:03:59) shrinking the economy is okay okay so so the the idea of perpetual growth is on

(1:04:06) its face silly it's not going to be able to be kept up indefinitely okay it's just not going to be able to

(1:04:12) so well what so there's got to you just agree with the same thing and talk about shrinking the economy he's talking about

(1:04:18) just not not having exponential growth in the economy is the way that you guys tend to look at these things

(1:04:24) instead of looking at it through the prism of okay everybody has a high-paying job but the

(1:04:29) economy didn't grow that much this year it's like okay i can deal with that

(1:04:36) but anyway okay so the next question um what is the implementation time for

(1:04:41) immigrant labor versus new babies in order to solve labor supply

(1:04:49) is that to us um i have no idea i have no idea what the time frame would

(1:04:55) take probably a generation okay um

(1:05:02) okay so can andrew provide a clear and concise definition of import

(1:05:09) yeah i don't know i can pull up webster i just supplement import with you want them to come in and

(1:05:14) you're you know they're not tying them up and shipping them in man it's just a tournament all right so what

(1:05:20) does andrew think about the child tax policies in the stimulus package love them okay

(1:05:28) let's see got lost in some of these um did we do this one why does andrew

(1:05:35) keep talking about races instead of america as a whole i don't

(1:05:41) okay let's see where we're at

(1:05:48) um did we do this one i'm getting lost in some of these uh we just we did this one didn't we

(1:05:56) yeah okay we did that one um all right so here we go uh for both of

(1:06:02) you why do we continue to let the veterans get screwed in bills and legislation

(1:06:08) but we take care of lgbtq and black lives matter sector of folks um i don't think we should get

(1:06:17) blood veterans get screwed i think the way that we treat veterans is pretty disgusting in the united states

(1:06:22) andrew because um the left doesn't give a [ __ ] about veterans to be perfectly honest with you

(1:06:29) the left doesn't really seem to give a [ __ ] about anything except creating a voting block coalition that

(1:06:35) will get them elected that's why okay see where i am

(1:06:46) why does andrew want women barefoot and pregnant that's my mom what is she talking about

(1:06:54) why why why is that argument always used that pregnant women have to be barefoot i've never heard that in my life is that

(1:07:00) it they always have to be barefoot i mean i get it you're saying you know you're a misogynist and you just want women to be baby pumping factories i

(1:07:06) understand that but i just never understood why they have to throw in the barefoot i think that the insult is that they never leave the

(1:07:12) insult is they never leave the house oh okay gotcha um okay i've never heard

(1:07:18) that before they're allowed to leave the house now okay so do you think andrew do you think

(1:07:24) america culture needs to be protected absolutely do you want to elaborate i mean

(1:07:32) not really that would open up a whole new can of worms all right so um from airborne destiny

(1:07:38) how does ubi play into your economics um i don't have strong opinions on ubi um i

(1:07:46) they keep trying to do small-scale experiments of it and i never they like either don't finish or they just come to political pressure whatever if it works and it works um

(1:07:52) i don't know how it would end up working in practice but i mean if it ends up being an effective strategy i mean my favorite things like uh tax um

(1:07:58) like credits like refundable tax credits or negative income tax so i think you'll be uh maybe an okay idea to try yeah okay

(1:08:06) andrew keeps citing japan is he familiar with the lost decade of japan's economy

(1:08:11) which is highly attributed to a shrinking labor market no not really i only cited it in one

(1:08:18) specific instance uh regarding immigration and what their current policy is with immigration

(1:08:25) okay um where are we uh for andrew what is your definition of

(1:08:32) american culture oh man that's a loaded question it's all designed to say what's the dish what's

(1:08:38) the american dish there is an american culture it is deep seeded and it is different from everywhere else in the world

(1:08:45) and uh we can get into that topic another time but uh that's that's like i said it's in

(1:08:51) its own can of worms okay um andrew do you agree with economic

(1:08:56) economist um roderick holden in that you don't actually need multiple

(1:09:01) years to see if mussolini's program regarding birth was successful i'm not familiar with it okay

(1:09:09) got a lot of you know we got a lot of questions for andrea any uh for destiny would be great too um

(1:09:16) uh uh andrew how can you uh how can you be a capitalist and not

(1:09:22) support immigration it says i'm a capitalist it's an ethnic pop of fascist

(1:09:27) i'm i'm kidding that's it's an economic model um so i don't like capitalism

(1:09:35) i like free enterprise and capitalism seems to inevitably lead to crony

(1:09:40) capitalism almost every single time it's tried i'm not not the biggest fan of capitalism

(1:09:46) and i'd like to see a lot of restraints put on capitalism to be honest with you

(1:09:51) okay um what brand of cigarettes anderson the cowboy spellers cowboy

(1:09:56) killers they really um okay destiny can you

(1:10:02) describe american culture and do you think it is under attack

(1:10:07) i don't know if i would say there's like some coherent definition of american culture i think that american culture is incredibly fluid

(1:10:12) from place to place even within a certain state it could be incredibly um like it can be really different from

(1:10:17) from one area to another okay uh andrew what are your thoughts

(1:10:24) on the current labor situation of tomato town is that a thing i have no idea i think

(1:10:30) that that's a video game reference okay well i would not know then um

(1:10:39) destiny did tomato town not do well i don't know is that a video game reference i don't i'm i'm in the dark it's a video game it's a meme right now

(1:10:46) i think all right question to both of the bears what is the cause of the

(1:10:51) disproportionate african-american violent crime rate

(1:10:58) destiny if you want to go um it's probably a combination of a lot of different things um i think that the status of the

(1:11:06) black family right now is probably in a really bad state um we have a lot of single-parent households i think the criminal justice system

(1:11:12) plays into that pretty heavily it doesn't do them any favors i think that the dea scheduling of drugs

(1:11:18) is really bad um in terms of disproportionately causing a lot of harm to black communities i

(1:11:24) think that the lack of public funding in important institutions is bad in a lot of black communities so for instance money available for things like schools

(1:11:30) um and then i think the general socioeconomic status of black people in the united states is pretty bad

(1:11:37) so um he he says it's a it's a combination of things so the the

(1:11:43) uh disproportionate african-american violent crime rate has actually always been fairly high in

(1:11:49) the united states i don't think it has anything to do uh with racism at all there's a cultural

(1:11:56) thing that goes on with that also and uh he neglected to mention that part

(1:12:01) of it but where does the culture come from what's that where does the culture come from uh

(1:12:07) generally it comes from a lack of father in the home why do they have a lack of father in the home uh because

(1:12:13) for some reason there's a massive glorification of the black community of uh uh you know big pimpin and that

(1:12:20) kind of [ __ ] and uh yeah their dads don't stick around man yeah so where did this general idea um

(1:12:27) this rejection of the modern american life or this bucking against the system where did this come from for the black communities why do they

(1:12:33) exhibit this behavior more so than other communities in the united states well there's um i mean i don't

(1:12:40) i don't know it's hard to it's hard to say specifically a lot of people have tried to answer that question

(1:12:46) um i know i've heard fuentes talk about this uh in depth and he thinks that there's a

(1:12:52) portion of it that's genetic um maybe maybe there's some merit to that i i don't know i do know for sure

(1:13:00) that uh that it is disproportionately high and that it's not all socioeconomic

(1:13:06) gotcha okay okay um just got lost in this question

(1:13:13) uh um can angie provide an example of

(1:13:19) when a country successfully raise it its fertility rate with economic incentives

(1:13:25) i can't okay um andrew what is your opinion

(1:13:32) on interracial relationships i don't give a [ __ ]

(1:13:38) um okay there was one from okay destiny how does the blue collar

(1:13:44) workforce benefit from an increase in the money supply good question

(1:13:51) how does a blue collar work for us benefit from an increase in the money supply

(1:13:58) is this related to the federal reserve is that what this person is specifically asking about i have no idea

(1:14:06) i saw one from rachel that i lost my understanding is that federal reserve monetary policy is supposed to target

(1:14:12) two things one is unemployment and the other is inflation as long as inflation is low then they're

(1:14:18) free to practice either quantitative easing or the setting of a low federal funds rate

(1:14:23) in order to ensure that there is ample liquidity in the markets in order to ensure that

(1:14:28) um people have money flowing through the economy which in very complicated ways basically

(1:14:34) ensures that unemployment is kept at certain levels uh that's the goal that's what the goal of monetary policy for the federal reserve was supposed to be

(1:14:40) um yeah my money supply goes up interest drops the money supply goes down interest increases stuff stuff like that

(1:14:46) all right so from rachie moment to destiny if we can automate low-wage jobs why do we need immigrants

(1:14:54) great point um if we can automate low-wage jobs um

(1:15:00) ideally um there's like a negotiation that goes on with a firm where a firm wants to pay the least amount of

(1:15:06) cost for the greatest amount of like labor if we're forcing them to pay higher labor costs then inevitably that's going to

(1:15:12) end up with the consumer ultimately paying higher costs for goods and services so generally if you can get labor for cheaper that's usually preferred to

(1:15:18) automating things or having to pay more for labor um it's just it's an equation it's got like benefits and and

(1:15:24) drawbacks on both sides of it okay to destiny do you think a person living in new york has the same

(1:15:31) american culture than a person living in texas that's to me i guess so i don't know

(1:15:38) i would obviously say no to that let's see um why is there not focus on

(1:15:45) humanitarianism reasons for the biden admin opening are southern border

(1:15:51) borders um forget about the labor benefits that's not the reason

(1:15:58) why why is there humanitarian wait say that again why is there not more focus on

(1:16:03) humanitarianism reasons for the biden admin opening our southern borders

(1:16:09) forget about the labor benefits that's not the reason i have no idea what they're talking about i don't think they're saying that it's

(1:16:16) not a humanitarian effort to uh bring these people in it's designed to bolster the voting

(1:16:22) block of one single party that's probably what he's saying my understanding is i don't think biden is open to the border i don't think

(1:16:28) that's happened to the south um he didn't say they opened the border he said

(1:16:33) that the humanitarian efforts that are going on there is a thinly disguised veil and has nothing to

(1:16:39) do with humanitarianism at all but rather to push in

(1:16:45) migrants to become a voting bloc for this party so they're pushing in

(1:16:50) they're pushing in migrants gotcha okay they're pushing in migrants who are illegal that aren't able to vote

(1:16:56) in the hopes that they can pass legislation in the future that seven years after the naturalization process has begun they'll

(1:17:01) eventually become future democratic voters okay okay um a question for destiny would you

(1:17:08) support secession of the christian right i don't generally want secession of any part of

(1:17:14) the united states okay um did we already do this one uh

(1:17:21) for destiny what level should we set for high skill labor visas and why

(1:17:27) uh that's i am not going to answer the exact answer for that um i imagine it's probably going to have to do with the local employment levels of our own

(1:17:34) uh high school labor markets my understanding is that what should be happening i don't know what happens effectively but what should be happening

(1:17:40) is the federal government needs to have a process in place by which you're trying to get an american worker for the same

(1:17:45) wage for a particular job before you offer like a b1 visa for those jobs instead so if that as

(1:17:50) long as that process is being met then you can probably bring in people to fill the jobs otherwise if there isn't an american able to do that job

(1:17:57) to destiny why is it okay to just cross the border illegally when there's a long line of people

(1:18:03) who want to come here legally but have to wait um i think illegal immigration sucks but

(1:18:08) i think our normal uh immigration process is like super flawed and super broken right now so i don't really put much stock in it

(1:18:15) okay um essentially you don't care if they skip if they skip the line

(1:18:21) um i mean it's like do you support all right do you do you speed ever sure

(1:18:29) yeah sure i don't know i mean like i think that our immigration system was super broke i think that immigration to this country is a net positive fiscally

(1:18:35) and economically um so people are skipping to get in here like yeah [ __ ] it yeah it's cool

(1:18:40) it's fine all right so um echo based network says for both guests what if any comment do

(1:18:47) you guys share or see to eye eye on i think they're just i noticed that destiny plays rim world

(1:18:54) and that's a pretty awesome game i like it okay

(1:19:00) um i don't know if he likes it i have no idea i've got a lot of hours in real world huh

(1:19:05) can andrew name three policies implemented by the american right that helped

(1:19:11) veterans since he believes the left is the only political sect

(1:19:16) in the u.s doesn't care about them so

(1:19:22) you want me to name three policies that republicans have passed off the top of my head that benefited

(1:19:27) uh veterans i can pull some up i guess but no i can't name them off the top of

(1:19:33) my head i think i know it doesn't count as veterans but i don't know why i'm pretty sure it was two republican senators who

(1:19:40) were the ones involved i remember the names and blocking the getting help for the 911 firefighters i thought that was pretty ridiculous for a

(1:19:45) party that claims to like veterans i don't know if you count firefighters and police officers as veterans but

(1:19:51) okay so to destiny what is your opinion on biden's presidency so far um seems based but i've been following

(1:19:58) like way more local issues um right now rather than um like the national level stuff but

(1:20:04) i mean it's cool they got the 1.9 trillion a stimulus passed it seems like he's been making a lot of work on eos

(1:20:09) um yeah okay so question both um thoughts on the current situation of

(1:20:14) syria having 10 kills on so that's amazing that's the name that's something just go to the next one okay

(1:20:23) um andrew what are your thoughts on connor joyce and how does his

(1:20:30) social economics dance affect texas i have no idea who that is

(1:20:35) who's calling her joyce i don't know okay um i think okay let me just make

(1:20:43) sure we're all caught up and then we can probably shut this down um [Music]

(1:20:48) yeah i think wait what is this one uh andrew are you a fan of hearts of iron

(1:20:55) four never heard of it i don't think that was one that was oh wait that was to you

(1:21:00) okay um oh wait there's one more uh uh destiny are there any cultural sex that

(1:21:08) should be shown preference for immigration over others um i think like

(1:21:15) i think like basic criminal backgrounds should be investigated so obviously like if you've committed murders or like some big crimes in other countries you

(1:21:21) probably shouldn't be allowed in um culture checks get weird because as soon as we say like we can do a culture

(1:21:26) check you're basically begging whoever is currently the ruling party to only letting people that align with their culture

(1:21:31) so if republicans you know were in charge they'd probably only let people in that like had like higher religious

(1:21:36) or social conservative values if democrats were in charge they'd probably let people only and that are like way more progressive in values

(1:21:42) um so yeah i don't think i don't think you can mark it that way i think that would look really weird okay um to destiny do you think

(1:21:51) the adoption of automation is going to happen regardless of wages yeah at some point it will get there um

(1:21:58) and we have to deal with that when the time comes yeah okay so i mean i think we're all caught up so we can probably shut this down

(1:22:06) um thank you guys both for coming on thank you so much destiny for doing this i really appreciate it um and thank

(1:22:35) argument for the other side and i just can't come up with anything i always get so paranoid that i'm gonna just

(1:22:40) miss something that i'm like [ __ ] there's like there's like some killer bullet to my argument and i just can't think of it right now and i'm gonna get

(1:22:46) [ __ ] i'm gonna get so blindsided tomorrow every single time i worry about that it's actually always like just a horribly stupid conversation
