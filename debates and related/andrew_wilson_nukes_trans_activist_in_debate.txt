(0:00) six you can change Let me ask you that That's my claim about sex this entire time Okay Well let's see if that's true
(0:05) Let's see if that's true or not Let's assume for a second that somebody goes down the exact same pathway that you did
(0:11) I'm I'm just going to ask one slight personal question You don't have to answer it of course but just for the
(0:16) demonstration purposes have you taken HRT yes Okay good So assuming that
(0:22) somebody has the exact same story that you do however does not color their hair purple and does not grow it out right or
(0:30) let's just say that they do in fact do this Okay but they say that they're not a woman Would you classify them as one
(0:37) as a woman are we talking about woman or are we talking about female would you
(0:43) classify them as a woman so woman is a social category Okay I think we would have to examine their lived social
(0:49) experience to classify them as a woman So one more time I'm going to ask this right because it's very important Andrew
(0:56) Wilson completely dominates this nominal Naomi Nominal Naomi is a trans person
(1:01) and a trans activist who thinks who wants to try their hand at arguing the
(1:08) losing matter of if men can identify as woman and on transgenderism But of
(1:14) course Andrew Wilson with the common sense on his side just isn't having it
(1:19) and owns him with the facts and the logic Let's see how this debate between
(1:25) Andrew Wilson and nominal Naomi goes down Faceted things What is the definition of a woman in your perview
(1:32) would you would you like a definition i would like you to give me your definition or what you I can certainly I
(1:38) can certainly give you a definition of woman but I want to be clear that I don't believe that there is like one end all beall definition for any term let
(1:45) alone woman but because I recognize women more so under a sociological framework I would say that uh a woman is
(1:51) an individual who's assigned feminine roles and expectations by their society based on perceived femininity
(1:58) femaleeness andor stated identity So it's a just a perception There's nothing foundational
(2:04) I said it's based on a lived social experience Well it sounds like it's an empty label because you're not telling me what it actually is What is I told
(2:11) you it's based on a lived social experience Feminine roles and expectations assigned to you by society
(2:16) What is the actual definition according to Naomi if I if I just provided it to
(2:21) you If I declared that I was a woman would I be one i don't think so Why that
(2:27) is not your sincere identity But it assuming that also that's not your social experience
(2:34) I hate it when the um these trans people or trans activists how they always like
(2:39) go by like if I were to say well what if I uh identify as a woman they would say well no I don't think you're being
(2:45) sincere Like they always fall onto the I don't think you're being sincere However they tell us that we should treat all
(2:51) trans people like regardless if they're really trans or not uh as their preferred identity So here's the thing
(2:58) Like yes nominal Naomi here might know that Andrew Wilson is not actually a
(3:04) trans person because you know they probably watch his debates and stuff like that in videos But if Andrew Wilson
(3:11) was out on the street with a wig and a dress on and said he's a woman you know not Naomi wouldn't know if they were
(3:17) really trans or not They wouldn't know So I hate it when they just go "Well I know you're not being sincere about it."
(3:23) It's like "Yeah okay but what about the person random person on the street how do you know if they're sincere or not
(3:28) assuming that I took it as my lived identity do you need to have the social experience of being a woman in order to
(3:33) be one are you asking descriptively or prescriptively i'm asking you Well I think that descriptively if we're
(3:40) recognizing woman as a lived social experience then that would encompass somebody who lives that social role But
(3:45) if we're talking about how I think that people should be prescriptively treated then I would want to treat people based
(3:51) off of their sincere identity That is completely an answer to your question a woman If a man claims that they're a
(3:57) woman a biological male claims that they're a woman what makes them not one what do you mean i don't know how else I
(4:04) can possibly frame that better but I'll try If a person says Naomi I have all
(4:10) the same characteristics that you do but I'm not a woman Are they a woman are if
(4:15) we're talking descriptively if their lived social experience is that of a woman descriptively they would be a
(4:20) woman So would you misgender them pres No because I I interact with people based off of my prescriptive beliefs
(4:28) Okay So uh anybody who says they're a woman you're going to consider them to
(4:34) be one Is that if it's a sincere identity then prescriptively yeah Well how would you know if it's sincere or not you have to just have to take them
(4:40) at their word I think that you can typically do this based off of a vibe check For example when Steven Crowder
(4:45) when Steven Crowder dressed up as a woman and said that he was a woman I didn't believe him But I think that a
(4:52) trans woman who sinceriously said who sincerely believes that you know they are a woman they want to be a woman it's
(4:58) pretty easy to tell based on the vibe You just told me that based on the vibe if you feel like they aren't it's okay
(5:05) to misgender them If someone like Steven Crowder is pretending to be a trans woman I think it's okay to misgender him
(5:11) Okay But but what if you don't know what if what if they're claiming that they are you don't know for sure but the vibe
(5:17) you get is that they're not Is it okay to misgender him i mean I default to being pretty lenient with people but I think that based on the vibe check it's
(5:23) pretty easy to tell when someone is being you know very very dishonest Well how do you know they could be lying Like
(5:30) for instance if you tell me Naomi if you said to me Andrew I'm a woman And I said you're lying to me The vibe that I get
(5:37) is that you're not Why am I wrong because you claim because my lip
(5:42) social experience but you could be lying right sure people can lie about their
(5:48) lip social experience So then why ought I say something that I think is not true
(5:54) I mean you can say whatever you want to believe I'm simply arguing for what I believe and what I believe creates the
(5:59) most utility in these situations But Naomi I know what is I know that in the realm of what is I can do whatever I
(6:06) want I'm asking you why ought I do this thing why ought you do what why ought I go ahead and and do this thing where you
(6:13) claim that I need to go out of my way to call somebody based on the vibe whatever
(6:19) I want Even if I what if the vibe I'm getting is that they're lying I never said that you have to do this I'm
(6:24) explaining why I do this Well regardless it's still an ought Do you don't you
(6:29) think people ought not misgender other people yes I think that people ought to treat people based off of their the the
(6:35) gender role that they would like to live in What if your vibe is that they're lying is it okay to misgender them if
(6:41) it's somebody that it seems that they are very much being dishonest Yeah Well I don't know what that means though It's
(6:47) that's all subjective You don't you don't know what vibe checks are I think I think there's lots of things that we vibe check Freaking vibe checks You know
(6:54) it's it's so ridiculous cuz this person tries to sound smart tries to like rely on studies and science Uh but then they
(7:02) go "Oh but the my vibe checks." What does that even mean vibe checks Do you
(7:07) want a scanner over them and their vibes check out they're being sincere You
(7:13) can't always tell if a person's lying There are some people that are really good liars So spare me this whole vibe
(7:19) check nonsense It's ridiculous Well wait a second If any human being then based on the criteria of like conservative
(7:26) Christian thinks that a transgendered woman is lying about being a woman they
(7:32) should then misgender them because their vibe is that they're lying Oh me
(7:37) I I don't think that they they think the trans woman is lying I think they disagree with the trans woman which is not the same thing as thinking that the
(7:43) trans woman is lying Well they think they're lying about being women Wait wait Is it a lie if like the
(7:49) conservative person and the trans woman has a different perceptive of like what gender means and and the trans woman
(7:55) sincerely believes that she is a woman like is that a lie or is that just a different perspective it's a lie If from
(8:00) the conservatives perspective they believe that's not a lie at all If a Christian person believes that what
(8:06) you're doing well okay lies are based often on perspective They can't be malicious This is true but they're based
(8:13) often on perspective The conservative wouldn't be lying then by misgendering you would they wait what do you what do
(8:19) you think a lie is i think that a lie is a false statement I'm not going to endlessly define everything under the
(8:24) sun with you If you want me to pull up a definition of lie I will But it's acting in a way which is dishonest right yes
(8:32) person acting dishonest by claiming that she's a woman Just because she has a different definition of woman that
(8:38) doesn't mean she's acting dishonest How do we detect what's a lie how do you detect what's a lie i think
(8:45) there are lots of things that it's kind of hard to detect what's a lie and we kind of just take people on their word or based on a check I mean somebody for
(8:51) example somebody could li somebody could lie to you about what their name is but we kind of just take people at face
(8:57) value on that Yeah of course If someone tells you their name is like Rick but their name is actually Scott you know
(9:03) yeah Like you're not going to know that You're just going to take them at their word until there's evidence that comes
(9:08) out that his name's not actually Rick I mean obviously you're not going to you can't see what a person's real name is
(9:14) It's not tattooed on their face So yeah if someone comes up to you goes "Hey yeah my name's Rick." Yeah of course
(9:20) you're going to take them at face value because why not people first of all people don't usually lie about their name So it's really weird if someone
(9:26) does lie about their name And two the only way that you would know that this person isn't really named Rick is if you
(9:32) meet someone from their past that says their name is actually Scott or you run into some kind of documentation like
(9:39) their ID or something uh that says that their name's actually Scott Yeah But if
(9:44) somebody came up to you and they had a scar across their face and they said "I have no scar on my face." Is it okay to say that you're lying well if it's based
(9:52) on something that is physically observable then perhaps they are lying If it's based on something that's physically observable that you can see
(9:58) and from your perspective is not true you're not actually lying then by misgendering someone Gender is not
(10:04) something that's just like purely physical Really there's a metaphysical aspect to
(10:10) it What What would that be i would say that gender is more so sociological in nature
(10:16) So it's a social construction That's true But every manifestation that you can point to of it would be physical
(10:22) Correct Um I guess like are things like
(10:28) behaviors physical the way that they manifest are physical
(10:34) yeah I would certainly think that like gendered expression there would be physical manifestations of it Yes It's
(10:39) all physical We've established this So I don't know what you're talking about You essentially have just told me that if a
(10:45) person believes that the other person is lying in regards to gender that it's
(10:50) perfectly okay for you to misgender them This is your stance you just took Naomi
(10:56) I think that if it's like very clear that somebody is being dishonest you don't have to you know follow along with
(11:02) that But trans people aren't being you know dishonest by claiming to be a certain gender
(11:09) Okay Well you claim this but if my from my perspective they are What's wrong
(11:14) with me saying that you're lying and then misgendering you so a lie requires
(11:19) intent This is something that you've said yourself Yeah but I'm not lying about it Wait wait but you said that the
(11:25) trans person is lying The trans person had no intent of being dishonest No the intent was You yourself have said that lies require intent but there is no
(11:32) there is no intent of dishonesty when a trans woman claims to be a woman The conservative also isn't lying to you
(11:38) by misgendering you is he i never said that they were lying Right They're not lying So the thing is is
(11:45) that in order to be completely honest a conservative must
(11:51) misgender Boom Completely silenced this nominal Naomi Here's the thing They're
(11:57) saying well they're saying lying requires intent
(12:02) But how do you know which one's intentionally lying if you have two transgender people come into the room
(12:08) one is someone that actually believes that they're the opposite gender in their brain and then the other person
(12:13) doesn't really believe they're the opposite gender They just want to I don't know be a creep or something like
(12:18) that or fulfill their own uh fetishes or whatever they got going whenever they got going on How do you know which one's
(12:25) intentionally lying is that where your vibe check comes in if I mean like if that's what they
(12:32) believe like Yeah Yeah Because that's the point Like I'm not saying like they have to like gender a trans person as
(12:39) the trans person would right so because that would be a lie and that would be bad and that would be
(12:45) against the vibe So as we can see as we can see ladies and gentlemen just so you know out in the audience Naomi made a
(12:52) phenomenal case for why anybody who doesn't believe that a trans woman is a
(12:57) woman it's okay to misgender them because Naomi wouldn't want you to lie after all Right Naomi well hold up I I
(13:05) think that there is a loss of utility in doing so Now people can people can you
(13:10) know for for whatever their intentions are they can still do things that have bad outcomes So For example misgendering
(13:17) a trans person it has negative outcomes That's a bad thing Doesn't lying have
(13:23) negative outcomes Uh it certainly can Yeah So how do we
(13:28) determine if the lying has a worse negative outcome than the negative
(13:33) outcome on your utilitarian chart of how the person feels who is doing the lying
(13:38) wait what is the negative outcome for like a conservative to like gender transition correctly how is that a
(13:44) violate your religion i just told you You just expressed that if from the perspective of the Christian they
(13:51) believe that they're lying by uh giving you a gender that they don't believe is true that actually correlates with the
(13:58) sex in which you're trying to express they would be lying That's against their core value There's no utility in it for
(14:04) them whatsoever In fact it's counter utils Negative utility Wait wait Just
(14:09) because like a religious person believes something doesn't necessarily mean that like that is a moral action to do Just
(14:15) because a transgender person believes something doesn't necessarily mean it's a moral action either Right which is why we should look at objective outcomes
(14:21) such as the mental health and overall wellbeing of trans people Why should we look at objective outcomes wait wait
(14:26) stop And the affirmation people improves those outcomes You smuggled this in the
(14:32) objective outcome right how do we know that this is the objective outcome that it's more harm for you to tell the
(14:40) entire swath of the American public some 270 million who self-identify as
(14:46) Christian that it's better for them to lie from their perspective uh than it is for your for you to be
(14:53) lied to because you think the outcomes are more negative There is no harm in gendering a trans person correctly And
(14:59) we have research studies medical studies which show that trans people's mental health outcomes are better when they are
(15:05) socially affirmed in their gender like in the gender they wish to be Well that's nice for them but what about the person doing the gendering where's the
(15:11) study showing what it does to the person's psychology when they're forced into a situation of having to lie to
(15:17) make you feel better what about the psychology of a person that says "Okay yes uh I'm going to even though I know
(15:25) this person entering the women's bathroom is a man and I see that they're a man uh what does it do to a person's
(15:32) psy psyche if they know that it's a man and they're now have to allow them into
(15:38) the woman's restroom where they're potentially putting women and young girls in danger what do you think that
(15:43) does to their psyche that they have to therefore lie to themselves and convince themselves and gaslight themselves that
(15:50) no no no this is actually a woman and allow them into a woman's restroom where
(15:56) uh they're putting people in danger or when they allow a man in women's sports
(16:01) where again they are putting women in danger What do you think it does to their psyche where's the studies on that
(16:07) there are none because this person's going to say "Well there's no studies on this." Well yeah they're not doing studies on them but they should They
(16:14) probably should do studies don't you think i don't think that we have necessarily like studies I don't think
(16:20) we have any evidence which shows that like Christians are harmed by gendering a trans person correctly I think we
(16:25) should be I think we should default to analyzing that as neutral Unless you can present evidence that it's harmful You
(16:31) should default to analyzing that as you know why there's no evidence There's no evidence because nobody will fund what
(16:36) it does psychologically to a population to be forced to lie And are you really
(16:42) claiming to be victimized by like calling a trans woman she like that victimizes you you said earlier that
(16:49) based on the vibe that a woman's not just anybody who says they're a woman because if that were true then just
(16:57) based on the vibe you can say no that's not true Right you said that that's totally appropriate Meaning from the
(17:02) person's perspective the individual's perspective it's okay for you if you believe that you're lying to not lie
(17:09) Right so I'm talking about like trying to figure out people who are being
(17:15) disingenuous A trans person is not being disingenuous Now they are you are you are claiming that like you're claiming
(17:22) that there is a harm in having or or in like gendering a trans person correctly How are you the victim in gendering a
(17:28) trans person correctly because you're forcing me to lie I am not forcing you to lie Yeah And not only that it's
(17:34) emotional hostage taking because transgenders are saying either lie to us or we'll kill ourselves
(17:42) I never said that Well but when we talk about the data that you're about to get
(17:47) into for why it's objectively better to not misgender trans people the number one thing you're going to bring up is
(17:53) that they may consider self suicide if we don't gender them correctly Correct
(18:00) So just because like like If you are going to like is it correct that trans people commit suicide at like greater
(18:07) rates when they are not socially affirmed i'll just restate it really simply Is it not correct that you're
(18:12) about to tell me that the number one reason that we need to use the proper pronouns is because if we don't
(18:18) transgender people are going to kill themselves Isn't that true isn't that really what you're going to tell me next
(18:24) i don't think that's like necessarily like the the main or only reason I think that just like doing things that lead to
(18:29) you know better more accepting more welcoming more happy healthy societies
(18:34) in general is a good thing such as gendering trans people correctly Because if we don't gender trans people
(18:40) correctly what's the consequence Naomi worsened mental health and all the things that are associated with which
(18:46) leads to it can lead to mental health disorders It can lead to suicide There are lots of
(18:52) things that it can lead to Okay there are lots of negative outcomes it can lead to Don't you want Don't you want to
(18:57) prevent those negative outcomes well perhaps it depends on what we mean
(19:02) when we're saying negative outcomes When I'm asking specifically here do you want to like prevent transiting suicide i
(19:09) want to know why you think that a whole swath of the population that may not believe this should do it anyway other
(19:17) than the fact that you're holding us emotionally hostage literally at the barrel of a gun to your own heads to say
(19:25) if you do not do this we are going to collectively start killing ourselves I
(19:30) never said that I have never used any language I have never used any language
(19:35) as emotionally hostage taking I'm simply stating we can create better social outcomes by socially affirming trans
(19:42) people That is just a fact I'm just stating facts here What social outcomes do you want to see you want to see
(19:48) mental health I want to see improved well-being right why do you want to see those things because if trans suffer
(19:54) from a worse mental health stasis what ends up happening their suicidality rate
(19:59) goes through the roof Right this is the number one critique is it not that is certainly one thing that happens but
(20:05) also socially affirming trans These people like Naomi here they believe that if you don't affirm someone's uh chosen
(20:12) gender that they will unalive themselves They know that that's that is a big
(20:17) reason why they they push this stuff because they don't want uh trans people unaliviving themselves I don't know why
(20:23) they just don't be honest and be like "Yes that is the number one reason." But when when they're confronted and have
(20:30) their feet held to the fire they they try to deny it and say "No that's one reason but but and it's like just be
(20:37) honest and just say yes it's because we don't want trans people to unal alive themselves." You which by the way if you
(20:43) were to misgender me and call me a woman like it would be annoying but I wouldn't want to unalive myself So I mean haven't
(20:51) these people ever thought that there might be something deeper going on i mean obviously at on the face of it if
(20:57) you believe you're the opposite gender obviously you can already tell there's something deeper going on But if the
(21:03) only way is you have to affirm them or else they're going to do something bad to themselves that's already unhealthy
(21:11) And shouldn't we looking be looking to other solutions than just affirming everything that they want people leads
(21:17) to good social outcomes for everyone When trans people are more included in society when they're more able to
(21:23) self-actualize they can become happy healthy members of society that are more productive and that helps us all I think
(21:29) you should be interested in this too If you want a happy healthy productive society you know building a diverse and
(21:35) accepting society is going to help us all and that would include the social affirmation of trans people Well Naomi
(21:41) let's dive into that and see if that's true Right When you say that we should socially affirm trans people's identity
(21:47) because it's good for the trans people why do I a Christian conservative believes I'm lying by calling you
(21:54) something I know for sure at least from my perspective is a lie Why is that good for all of society considering that
(22:00) you're outnumbered thousands to one because there is no harm in you
(22:06) gendering a trans person as they wish Meanwhile we have demonstrable benefits of gendering a trans person as they wish
(22:12) Naomi is lying harmful uh it certainly can be Okay it can be
(22:17) And if you were a person who was a Christian and one of the foundations of your religion was that you were not allowed to lie would it be harmful for
(22:25) you then to do something that was contrary to your own religious values it can be Would it be i don't think that I
(22:33) can make a blanket statement there You don't think that a person who lived their life contrary to their own values
(22:39) that that wouldn't be harmful i think that it certainly can be but I think that people have justifications
(22:46) for things where they might have conflicting values such as you know I think that you in general would believe
(22:51) that reducing the amounts of people that kill themselves is a good thing You also believe that lying is a bad thing You
(22:57) have some conflicting beliefs there So I mean you know there's some there's some things to So you want me to lie so that
(23:03) trans people won't kill themselves right i don't think it's a lie But that's that's what you want Why not
(23:09) just admit that that's what So notice how they switch it up because he confronts he confronts Naomi and says
(23:15) "So you want us to lie so they don't do this?" And Naomi goes "Well I don't think it's a lie." So notice how they
(23:21) had to move the goalpost the goalpost now and now say "Well I don't think it's a lie to justify this action because
(23:28) they know it's wrong." So now they have to say "Well I don't think it's a lie." Well yeah If you're a regular person and
(23:36) you have to identify a trans person as something different that you know that they're not then it is a lie by default
(23:42) That's what you want It's a lie from my perspective I'm not saying that you're lying Listen Naomi I want to be
(23:48) ultimately charitable here I'm not claiming that you yourself are trying to lie to me I don't believe that that's
(23:55) true Okay from my perspective though regardless of what you believe I think
(24:01) you're lying Therefore it's contrary to my religious belief structure which is very harmful to me So why should I
(24:07) affirm the identity unless it's to somehow stop you from doing self harm you're asking me to
(24:15) do something against my moral values in order to stop you from self harming How
(24:20) is that a justification how is that good for society how is it good for society because it
(24:28) leads to better social outcomes How do you know because we have studies on this We have studies We don't have any
(24:33) studies on how we have studies on trans people Okay Well if we don't if we don't have any evidence for your claim I think
(24:39) we have to default default to it being utilitarian No we don't First of all that's not how science works Science
(24:45) doesn't only If you don't have evidence that it's actually like harmful to you I don't think you can claim that it's
(24:51) harmful to you Well first of all I wait a second I have no evidence harm I'm
(24:57) telling you that you're asking me personally to do something that conflicts with my own moral values That
(25:03) would be harmful to me Yeah Um I think that you have moral values
(25:08) that are at conflict there because you also have a moral value for social good Don't you
(25:15) uh it depends on what the social good is say like people in general having better mental health and um like like being
(25:22) more so able to self-actualize Not necessarily It depends You don't think that people should have better
(25:28) health you don't think on specific criteria give people better mental health on average like for instance if you were to say should a person take a
(25:34) magic pill that makes them live for 300 years i would tell you no I'm talking about mental health Okay But let's say
(25:40) you said that a person could take a pill Like I said it's the criteria that matters You have to be very specific
(25:45) here I'm giving you something that is now It is right this second I'm telling you that Christian conservatives don't
(25:52) want to gender trans people based on the pronouns of their preference because we think we're lying and so this causes
(25:59) actual harm to us on the scale you say but the only empirical evidence that I can demonstrate is the harm to ourselves
(26:06) that's nice right but there is public way to yourself if I were Andrew I would
(26:13) bring up the whole well yes lying can lead to harm because if I lie to myself
(26:18) and tell myself oh that man dressed like a woman is entering the woman's bathroom Uh and then it turns out later on some
(26:24) girl got hurt in that bathroom by that man dressed like a woman Uh well yeah because I lied to myself and I lie to
(26:32) other people that has led to harm So I would bring up that point that yes actual tangible harm does come out of
(26:39) this lying I just told you that I'm you're asking me to lie and that's harmfularmful to my psychological health
(26:47) What that's entire That's not empirical You don't have any numbers It's objective
(26:52) You're saying it hurts my feelings but that's just entirely That's all you're saying No no I'm saying I'm saying we
(26:58) have objective data which shows that trans people live better lives Oh you're so when they when they are socially
(27:04) affirmed No the objective data that you're going to say is that these amount of people were pulled and it hurt their
(27:10) feelings Isn't that true no We also have objective data on things like educational outcomes things like uh
(27:16) economic outcomes Trans people who are socially affirmed do better in like in
(27:21) society They get better jobs They they acquire higher education We can actually point to objective outcomes that have
(27:28) been studied here But you can't point to any objective outcomes Yes I can I can I've already done this multiple times
(27:33) I'm saying no you just pointed to your subjective logically You have logically stated this multiple times already that
(27:40) a person who has the religious values that I have that of saying something
(27:46) that's perceived as a lie from their perspective would probably be harmful to them I said it can be Yeah it can be And
(27:53) I don't I said it can be Do you Okay so let me ask you this Do you think that Christians conservative fundamentalist
(28:00) Christians why do you think that they don't want to label transgender people by their pronouns because it hurts their
(28:06) feelings So it hurts them I think I think I think their poor Fifi are in
(28:12) danger I think it's I think it's snowflake TV So it hurts So Naomi attacks us and says it's because it
(28:17) hurts our Fifi and that we're being snowflakes Again more manipulative
(28:22) behavior like oh no it's because we're getting our feelings hurt and that's why we don't do this Oh what are you a
(28:29) snowflake is that why you don't want to properly gender somebody uh even though
(28:35) literally their whole thing is if you don't gender them the way they want to be gendered they unal alive themselves
(28:42) So we're the snowflakes make it make sense So it hurts them
(28:49) I I I think I think it's just about their feelings So okay and what is it for trans people if it's not about
(28:54) feelings it's about objective outcomes which we have measured in like the based on based on how they feel It's all based
(29:00) on how they feel No not just based on feelings based on mental health based off of socioeconomic attainment Naomi
(29:06) you're so full of If a person does better socioeconomic attainment is different than feelings The affirmations
(29:11) that are happening for trans people are so that they feel better so that they can do all the education and blah blah blah Isn't that true what' you say i
(29:20) said specifically it's their feelings that lead to those outcomes right it's
(29:25) based 100% on how they feel and that's what's actually leading to those better
(29:30) outcomes based% on how they feel It's 100% based on how they feel Otherwise
(29:36) why would the affirmations matter to them um how I guess how can you say it's 100%
(29:44) based on how they feel it can't be based on anything else
(29:50) I think that it certainly can be based off of things like social cohesion That's not necessarily a feeling
(29:57) So of course it's a feeling What else is it no like like actually like having greater connections is not just a
(30:03) feeling Like if you if you have like if you're better able to network that's not necessarily just a feeling Like that's
(30:09) something where it's like something you've actually achieved What's the purpose of it the purpose of it is how you feel All of the affirmation is based
(30:16) around how you feel All affirmations are based around feeling You say that this
(30:23) does harm to Christians because it hurts their feelings I'm saying the same argument The only thing that it does
(30:28) harm to you on is that it hurts your feelings But there's far more of us whose feelings get hurt We know this
(30:34) because I can demonstrate to you how many Christians there are fundamentalists in this nation A lot more feelings get hurt on this side
(30:42) So what are what are like the negative outcomes of that like like what are the what are the objective negative outcomes
(30:47) you're about to tell me you're about to tell me Naomi that the negative outcomes if we don't do what you say is that
(30:54) trans people are going to kill themselves Just so you know that is perhaps trying to hold us
(30:59) emotionally hostage One negative outcome I'm not holding you hostage I'm just stating that that's something that happens when trans people are not
(31:06) socially affirmed for us is that we feel like we're strangers in our own nation and religion We feel like people are
(31:13) allowed to not only broadly lie I asked I asked for objective outcomes Do you have any the objective outcomes is that
(31:20) our mental health suffers from having to lie What is what's your like source on that what you're my source on it I asked
(31:27) for like objective outcomes You already told and you just pointed you just pointed to your feelings Like you don't have objective outcomes Naomi why again
(31:34) do fundamentalist Christians not want to use proper pronouns because they're snowflakes Because it hurts their
(31:41) feelings Yeah because it hurts their feelings Source Give me the source Naomi Give me
(31:47) the source Well that's talking about a subjective No give me the source Naomi Give me the source that it hurts their feelings right now Do it So this is
(31:53) brilliant by Andrew Completely turning it around on Naomi here using Naomi's
(31:59) own words against them What do you guys think about this so far sound off in the comments section below Smash that like
(32:04) button if you are enjoying this If you think Andrew Wilson is completely dominating here Let's continue So I
(32:11) asked you for something objective I didn't want to just talk about Do you want me to Do you want me to give you
(32:16) sources about how affirming trans people gives them objectively better outcomes
(32:21) because I can do that But you can't give me any I asked for I asked for I asked for sources on objective data not
(32:28) sources on subjective data as you one sec I never asked you for a source on
(32:33) subjective data I asked you for a source on objective data It is subjective data You claimed that it was objective but
(32:39) you didn't have any data It's not objective Your source is based 100%
(32:44) around polling of how people feel That's not true And then based on those feelings you get true I I also have
(32:50) studies that are based off of like economic outcomes educational attainment which I'll leave That's not done based
(32:57) off of a poll of people's feelings You can collect this from demographic data That's not based off of a poll You said
(33:03) it was based on You said it was based solely on a poll but that's just not true We can actually assess the
(33:09) objective outcomes of trans people and they improve when they're socially affirmed Well let's find out if this is
(33:14) true or if you're lying to me again Okay so here we'll do it this way How would we know if those objective things like
(33:23) the economic outcomes and the mental health outcomes were true if you hadn't done a poll asking the person if the
(33:30) affirmations were the things that helped them uh get those results can you explain that to me real quick so you
(33:37) don't need to ask them like what gave you the results You simply ask them like
(33:42) like like information about their their level of social affirmation and then independently you assess objective
(33:49) outcomes Done So what and you correlate you correlate the social affirmation
(33:55) with the objective outcomes which is something I can do that you can't So let
(34:01) me help you out here Here's what you just said to everybody listening Here's what Naomi just said Naomi just said you
(34:07) can call them and ask them if the affirmations which directly uh uh you
(34:14) know posited in their life a type of feeling contributed to this outcome That's not what they just said That's
(34:21) not what I said Then what's what they ask people is about the level of social social affirmation that they experience
(34:27) in their gender identity Things like are their parents supportive things like do they have friends and family that are supportive of their gender identity they
(34:33) ask them things like that and then independently they use demographic data about things like e like economic
(34:39) attainment educational attainment and you correlate their level of social attainment with their with their
(34:46) objective outcomes This is something that I can do that you can't You don't have any studies but I don't need to
(34:53) What like Christian's level of misgendering trans people and how how
(34:58) that you know ends up in educational attainment economic attainment Let's back up Any studies on that yeah I do
(35:04) Well I don't Well here's the thing One I do And we'll pull up studies in just a second when I move on to my next argument as this one you're getting just
(35:10) destroyed on But I'm going to finish this up because you need you need to explain this It makes no sense to me You
(35:17) claim that we can do an objective analysis after they already feel good to show that the outcomes were good Okay
(35:24) Nobody's disputing that When I ask you how do you know or why is it that you
(35:30) think that Christians don't want to use their pronouns you say because it hurts their feelings But when I ask you for a study on that you say there isn't one Of
(35:38) course there's not one Nobody's bothered to do any of the research on it But you yourself are my source because you
(35:44) believe that that's the truth and so do I And that what we're really talking about here is hurt feelings across the
(35:51) board Your feelings get hurt which leads to worse outcomes for you in life But
(35:56) you want to assume to the rest of the audience that hurting the feelings of hundreds of millions of people no
(36:03) bearing whatsoever Who cares you like like like how how hurt how
(36:08) victimized are you by like gendering a trans person as they as they wish You're forcing religious people to lie you know
(36:14) at literally at gunpoint It is not a lie at all Yeah You're doing it at the at the gunpoint of self harm too because
(36:21) trans people are saying collectively it is not a lie at all Yeah Well if we don't affirm what they're saying is
(36:27) suicidality going to raise if we don't affirm the gender identities of trans identity yeah that does have
(36:35) the outcome of increasing their rates of suicide That is true So it's emotional hostage taking You're saying I have
(36:41) never like held you It's so annoying when Naomi says "Well I never held you emotionally hostage." Well yeah you are
(36:46) You You You all are All you guys are that push this ideology You guys are all holding us emotionally hostage You guys
(36:53) could deny it all you want but that's exactly what's going on here If you're telling people hey if you don't do this
(36:59) these people are going to unal alive themselves What else is that do you think I have never said you I
(37:06) have never said you need to do this because otherwise we're going to kill ourselves What I said is you should you
(37:13) should do things that lead to better social outcomes such as improving the mental health of trans people That's my
(37:18) claim You should do things that lead to the better social outcomes social outcomes for
(37:27) Christians that we believe is not a lie I I like what is what is the better
(37:33) social outcome well the social outcome there is that we're not lying and so therefore our mental health is greatly
(37:39) increased Yeah I don't think it's a lie to gender a trans person the way they wish I think it's Well then why do
(37:45) Christians want to misgender i think they don't understand that No you said it's because they had hurt feelings
(37:51) Don't change the argument now I thought it was hurt feelings 5 seconds ago Naomi Now it's something different I think
(37:58) that it can be both I think that you know like ignorance can breed those feelings Okay So if I'm ignorant on this
(38:05) are you saying that I don't know the difference between gender and sex i think that for a lot of people that misgender trans people they don't
(38:12) So if they were to misgender you they're not lying are they if they don't know the difference uh if they like I I I I
(38:20) guess I would certainly agree that lies require intent but I don't think like I can come up with a blanket statement of
(38:26) like lying is harmful or like lying is good I think that lying is kind of like morally ambiguous and it depends on the
(38:32) situation but what matters the most here what matters the most here is objective social outcomes Why does that matter the
(38:39) most we don't know what the objective social outcome could possibly be on
(38:44) subjecting hundreds of millions of people to having to lie We've never It's never We've never studied it We can't
(38:50) study it But you yourself know that there's a negative outcome because you've stated it now emphatically I
(38:56) don't know how many times that the reason that Christians don't want to gender you correctly is based solely on
(39:02) the fact that it hurts their feelings That's a negative outcome for hundreds of millions on the util scale Naomi
(39:10) so I don't think that they're I don't think that it's a lie to gender a trans person correctly though Okay But from
(39:17) their perspective they're lying I think that's what matters I think that we can educate them on why that's not a lie And
(39:24) we can educate you We can create the best social outcome if we can we could educate you on why that's not a lie In
(39:31) other words we could brainwash you into thinking that it's not a lie And yeah Andrew is right Well why can't we just
(39:38) educate them into thinking that they're not the opposite gender h why is that bad convince them that it's not a lie
(39:45) Yeah but why can't they educate you on why it is a lie so we know that that leads to worse social outcomes right
(39:51) that's right And the the social negative Yeah Right The social outcome being and
(39:58) this all by the way is emotional hostage taking not just the suicidality All of it If you're saying it's going to lead
(40:04) to worse social outcomes the whole thing is hostage taking If it doesn't provide you with a better education doesn't help
(40:09) you do this doesn't help you achieve this goal doesn't help you achieve that goal it's all emotional hostage taking
(40:15) across the board You're literally saying we need to make sure that we lie to you
(40:20) so that you have better outcomes That's emotional hostage It's not a lie And I've never said you need to do this I'm
(40:26) saying it's a good thing to do this Now I I guess like how Okay let's kind of
(40:32) let's kind of compare like let's kind of compare like what the what the actual social outcomes are Okay good How many Christians How many Christians kill
(40:38) themselves because they have to because they like gender a trans person correctly no it's never been studied Ought we do this ought we use proper
(40:45) pronouns do you think that's an uh ought we do that yeah I think that's an ought Well then you are saying it So don't lie and say you're not I'm not saying need
(40:52) You're saying you're conflating ought with need So what so what should happen if all fundamentalist Christians
(40:59) collectively tomorrow across the board decided that they were not going to adhere to gender pronouns right should
(41:08) there be consequences for that Naomi should there be consequences I think that perhaps like trying to
(41:15) educate them better Yeah I think I think that that's what I asked I asked if there should be should there be
(41:20) consequences should they get fired for instance from their job even though they have a conflict
(41:26) Misgendering people can certainly constitute like workplace harassment right so there has to be consequences So
(41:31) this is an a claim You want actual consequences to happen to people if they don't follow along with the we must
(41:38) gender you a certain way So if that's true then this is an claim and you are
(41:44) saying we need to do it or else I mean like I think that I think that the in like the workplace harassment case like
(41:50) you can create a hostile work environment by like vehemently misgendering people and that just makes the office worse for everyone Yeah But
(41:57) should there be a law that says that a person must do this a law that a person like must do this i don't think so That
(42:03) a person must gender correctly inside the workplace no I think this is probably better handled by like HR boards Um because like dealing with
(42:11) hostile work environments So it's not discrimination Is it discrimination to do
(42:16) what if I don't want to hire discrimination to do what yeah What if I What if I don't want to hire you and I say I don't want to hire you based on
(42:21) the fact that you have these pronoun restrictions you don't want to hire someone because they're trans because
(42:26) they have pronoun restrictions and they conflict Everybody has pronouns and they conflict with my faith So you want to
(42:34) you want to like be able to not hire someone who has a certain gender identity because of like your religion
(42:40) no I want to make sure that I don't h the requirement isn't that I have to lie to them from my perspective
(42:46) Uh I think you might get in into the territory of violating the the Civil Rights Act if you were to do that And
(42:52) what's the civil right like the civil right for people to be free from discrimination well what's
(42:58) discriminatory about it if there's no lie at least from the person's perspective discrimination doesn't have
(43:04) to be like a lie Well I think that discrimination preferences are mostly based around the fact that they're
(43:10) preconceived notions which are often wrong and lies No no Discrimination is denying somebody access to an
(43:17) institution based off of like a protected attribute such as gender identity for example That's discrimination That has nothing to do
(43:22) with lying But those people discrimination nothing to do with a lie Oh no it does What do people mostly
(43:28) discriminate along along the lines of stereotypes right
(43:35) that's perhaps one thing that people discriminate along probably the primary thing right they they discriminate based
(43:41) along stereotypical lines Wouldn't you agree that is one one one way in which like discrimination happens So I mean
(43:47) the stereotypical lines are mostly lies and that's why they're bad They're bad
(43:52) because they're not true and that's why you shouldn't discriminate But what happens if you have a conflict with somebody who's discriminating based on I
(44:00) don't think that discrimination is bad just because something's like untrue I think that discrimination is bad because it denies people equal opportunity Yeah
(44:06) But what's the motivation to discriminate to begin with typically feelings Typical typically feelings
(44:13) usually preconceived notions that are untrue Correct snowflakery Like for instance if somebody said "I don't want
(44:20) to hire Mexicans because I think that they're lazy." That would be a stereotype that's not true Correct
(44:27) That would be a stereotype that's not true That is correct Right And that's most of the reason that we have
(44:32) discriminatory practices right because of what because of stereotypes
(44:40) stereotypes are what leads most often to discriminatory practices
(44:45) Uh in in I guess typically typically yes But I don't think that like just because
(44:51) something is true or untrue is like what's harmful inherently about discrimination I think that what's inherently harmful discrimination is the
(44:57) denying of equal opportunity Not asking you what's harmful I'm asking you the motivation
(45:02) Oh wait I care about the harms I'm I'm a con I care about the motiv That's nice I care about the harms too But the
(45:08) motivation is what leads to the harms So you're kind of putting the cart before the horse
(45:15) Uh I don't think that like lies are necessarily what leads to the harms really So you don't think that it's
(45:21) basically the reason that most people would discriminate is based along preconceived notions that likely aren't
(45:28) true Isn't that the primary reason for discrimination that's typically how discrim typically
(45:34) typ lies That's what I'm saying So if you're in a situation where you don't h
(45:40) where you know something is true know it's true and you're forced to lie right
(45:46) you're saying you shouldn't be able to discriminate This is your Let me let me give an example Just be like something
(45:51) can be a stereotype that can be true and it can still be harmful to discriminate along those lines For example it is true
(45:59) that black people commit crime more on average than white people There are there are you know systemic reasons why
(46:05) this happens But if you were to discriminate against like black people because you just think like they're they're more likely to be criminals
(46:11) that's based off of something that is true but it's still harmful to discriminate there The harm isn't in
(46:17) whether or not something's true or false The harm is in denying people equal opportunity Yeah The problem is is that
(46:22) there's a lot of nuance within the confines of that statement especially when it comes to higher criminality by
(46:30) other perceived races For instance you don't believe in race right Neil i think that race is real
(46:37) You think that race is real at least as real as any other political
(46:42) construct That's not what I asked you Is biological race real is like skin color
(46:48) real no that's not what I asked you I asked you if biological race is real What do you mean by biological race i
(46:54) mean can you taxonomically categorize people biologically along racial lines
(46:59) uh to some extent Well what does that mean that like I
(47:05) said the gift is in the nuance Naomi so I think I think that like the the
(47:10) political category of race that we've constructed is not like strictly based off of like biological features I think
(47:16) it has much more to do with lineage which is not like cleanly delineated biologically
(47:23) What do what do you mean what does that even mean that doesn't mean anything Like what is race as a political i'm
(47:30) asking about the biological taxonomical categorization of race Is it true or false can you categorize people along
(47:37) racial lines or not there are certain there are certainly categor there are certainly lots of
(47:43) different categorizations of race and not all of them are strictly biological
(47:48) That's again to you go out of your way These things are these things are more nuanced than just like blanket answering
(47:55) yes Well you don't need a blanket answer You're asking for a blanket answer When
(48:00) I try to provide a nuanced answer you reject it You want me to give you a blanket answer which I'm not going to do This has to be rejected because this is
(48:07) a yes or no Can you taxonomically identify races biologically are there My
(48:16) answer is to an extent because it's more nuanced than than a blanket yes or no Okay So it's it's nuance Can a can a
(48:23) person change their race i don't believe so Why not because race is a political
(48:28) category defined by lineage and you can't change your lineage Then why did you just say it's more nuanced than that Naomi
(48:36) what do you mean how else can I say it why did you just go out of your way to say it's more
(48:41) nuanced that you can't say that race is a biological uh um imperative whether
(48:47) it's a more nuanced appeal right Okay fair enough It's a more nuanced appeal
(48:52) But then when I ask you to elaborate on this you can't I'm like look can you change your race or can't you and you're
(48:58) like I did elaborate and I said you can't change your race I can't because it's a political thing but you said that
(49:03) there's a biological aspect to it Can you change the biological aspect of it uh what are what are specifically
(49:10) biological traits you're referring to when you're referring to like biological i'm asking you That's why I asked you what there are lots of ways that people
(49:17) Well there are lots of ways that people define race If you're talking about race as in like certain genes that like
(49:22) people have based off of say like ethnic lines which only like to an extent kind of classify as race I mean obviously
(49:28) like you can't change those genes for example but if you're talking about like if you're talking about like you know
(49:34) the amount of melanin in someone's skin well I think we have some procedures that like can like inject people with melanin and stuff Perfect This leads me
(49:42) right to my next portion of my argument which is that if you cannot change your race due to the biological factors you
(49:48) also cannot change your sex due to the biological Are we talking about sex or are we talking about gender sex I
(49:55) thought this was a conversation about gender They're both intertwined Wouldn't you agree i would say they're correlated
(50:02) Sure they're certainly related but they're not the exact same thing I didn't say that they were did I but one
(50:08) more time I'm going to go down this road because it's it's very important If you cannot change your race how can you
(50:15) change your sex knowing that the genetics determine both of those things Sex is not determined by genetics
(50:22) Wait what sex isn't determined by genetics no What do you think a chromosome is Naomi i think that a
(50:29) chromosome is something that has genes but it's not the sole determin that has genes or it's
(50:36) dependent completely upon genes Chromosomes have genes
(50:42) What is a chromosome matt Walsh's next documentary What is a chromosome
(50:49) like it's it's the it's the piece of like your genome that has that has genes
(50:55) Wait what it's the piece of your genome that that's what you think uh a chro What is
(51:01) a chromosome why can't you answer that answer what a chrom pull up what a chromosome is cuz you just said it's not
(51:08) genetic Wait which is insane Hold up I said that sex is not solely genetic
(51:13) Chromosomes are genetic but sex is not solely based on chromosomes What's sex determined on would you like to know
(51:20) what sex is determined on so sex is multifaceted We can break it down into lots of categories There is a genetic
(51:27) component to sex but there's also an anatomical component There's a hormonal component Uh you can even talk about
(51:33) there's a brain component Genetic expressions Those are those are not all genes Hormones are not the same thing as
(51:39) genes And anatomy is not the same thing as genes Let me take a second to go
(51:45) ahead and show you why you're wrong on this
(51:50) Can you see this okay Naomi I can go ahead and scroll in for you This is the typical XX
(51:58) uh you know you know XX generally right for male you can see X is generally
(52:04) female Yes but this is for an XX male Okay Okay As you see the 46 XXX you see
(52:14) that it kind of goes around here and goes to smaller testes and then it goes right in line with what we would
(52:20) generally see with a person who did not have these XX chromosomes Now I'm going to show
(52:28) you the typical progression of an XY male If you look at the XY male here
(52:37) right I'll scroll in again You can see that there's that loop doesn't exist to
(52:43) bypass the um by potential gonad but it leads to testes and goes along the exact
(52:51) same arc Why does it go along that exact same arc because genetics determine what
(52:58) your sex is going to be You only have two paths ever There's not ever more than two paths Regardless of XY or XX or
(53:06) whatever chromosomes that you want to throw in it always relies on two Period
(53:13) There's only two paths ever available And we can actually chart this out Naomi
(53:19) So what are what like what are you saying that's like goes against anything I'm saying that the genes themselves are
(53:25) exactly what uh constitutes whether or not you're going to be male or female
(53:30) because genetics are what constitutes the two only paths that are available for a person to go down and there's only
(53:37) two Do you think that gene expression also has an impact on your biological sex
(53:43) gene expression in what way like the actual expression of genes like how your DNA is like read and processed I just
(53:49) gave you a demonstration of gene expression Yeah So you difference in X Y
(53:55) sex and a male So you would agree that gene expression like impacts one's biological sex right
(54:01) no Well no The pathways are only binary and they're only ever going to be binary
(54:06) But you you think that like gene expression like is is what causes like these biological sex differences right
(54:12) gene expression can cause there to be varants within the actual um sex
(54:19) construction itself which are mutations but no there's only two paths available period but like those paths are caused
(54:25) by gene expression right well yeah I guess you could say that they're caused by gene expression but
(54:33) the chromosomes the chromosomes of which are only have two paths gene expression is something you can change so when a
(54:39) trans person takes HRT it alters the gene expression of their cells
(54:44) So let me let me explain gene expression 101 is basically computer code It reads
(54:50) in like inputs and it produces outputs These inputs are things like hormones So
(54:55) that's a mass oversimplification Well I'm trying to explain it to people When your when your endocrine system is
(55:02) testosterone dominant your cells read in the testosterone input They produce these male outputs When your endocrine
(55:08) system is estrogen dominant it reads in the estrogen inputs and it produces female outputs This is gene expression
(55:14) 101 If a trans person takes HRT they alter the gene expression of their cells and those cells begin to go down the
(55:21) female development pathway I'm not saying it changes their chromosomes It changes their gene expression This has
(55:26) impacts on lots of their biological sex characteristics I've never claimed I've never claimed that you can change
(55:32) everything about your biological sex You can't change your sex but there is lots of things you can change lots of biological sex characteristics You can't
(55:38) change Let me ask you That's my claim about sex this entire time Okay Well let's see if that's true Let's see if
(55:43) that's true or not Let's assume for a second that somebody goes down the exact same pathway that you did I'm I'm just
(55:50) going to ask one slight personal question You don't have to answer it of course but just for the demonstration
(55:55) purposes Have you taken HRT yes Okay good So assuming that somebody has the
(56:01) exact same story that you do however does not color their hair purple and does not grow it out right or let's just
(56:08) say that they do in fact do this Okay but they say that they're not a woman Would you classify them as one as a
(56:17) woman are we talking about woman or are we talking about female would you classify them as a woman so woman is a
(56:24) social category I think we would have to examine their lived social experience to classify them as a woman So one more
(56:30) time I'm going to ask this right because it's very important If a person who had the exact same experiences that you have
(56:37) had and looks exactly like you do right this second claims that they're not a
(56:44) woman but is a man would you say that they're a man or a woman i think that
(56:50) their lived social experience would be that of a woman yet their gender identity could perhaps be that of a man What would you call them
(56:57) if I if I believe that they are sincere on their gender identity I would I would refer to them based on their gender
(57:03) identity because that's how I think we ought to treat people So it doesn't matter if they look exactly like you
(57:09) have the same experiences that you do Everything can be ex all equal across
(57:15) the board and you still wouldn't consider them a woman if they didn't want to be considered a woman Which is
(57:21) why your definition of woman is regressive because it's just anybody who identifies as one There is no
(57:26) delineation point There is no delineation point Hold up Hold up That's
(57:31) not boom Completely owned Great point by Andrew right there Yes absolutely true
(57:37) That's an excellent point Uh that's an excellent point if they had the exact same experiences as Naomi went through
(57:44) the exact same treatment did everything but at the end of the day said "I'm a man and I'm just want to look like a
(57:51) woman and my my preferred pronouns are you know man or he
(57:57) him My preferred pronouns are he him This person Naomi can't even answer
(58:03) it They would just say well like what a mind screw." So yes to
(58:08) Andrew's point it is just all about your gender expression just all about the feelings just what they want to be
(58:15) identified as which proves that all of this is just absolute nonsense And by the way an argument that uh would have
(58:22) been great to use in here would have been if you know they say well you have to lie to these group You have to lie to
(58:28) transgenders or else they're going to unalign themselves I would say okay great How you should also lie to
(58:34) Christians because you know atheists and all these people they don't think God exists They don't think God is real So
(58:40) what if we were to just force people and say well no you better affirm my belief that there is a God or else maybe HR
(58:49) maybe HR could take this up with you because you're not affirming my beliefs But we have that all the time We
(58:55) have atheists and all these other religions and stuff saying that no but we have atheists out here and secular
(59:02) humanists and stuff saying that you know our God isn't real It doesn't exist Well by your logic we should just
(59:08) force them to lie to us and affirm us or else But they're just lucky that under
(59:14) the teachings of Jesus Christ but they're just lucky that under
(59:19) the teachings of Christianity uh it is a sin to unal alive oneself So I think
(59:25) that's where they looked out on But if it wasn't oh you better best believe But
(59:30) what did you guys think about this how did you guys think Andrew Wilson did here against this nominal Naomi you can
