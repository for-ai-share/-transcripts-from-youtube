(3:01) program that's right that's right all right go ahead dude we'll start we'll start over i'll I'll introduce you to my
(3:08) guys because um you've got your YouTube channel but you're you're right now
(3:14) you're you've gone big on like there's so many clips I'm seeing online right now of you on whatever podcast calling
(3:20) out feminists and only fools uh workers and then you go on Piers Morgan last
(3:25) week and blast the hell out of basically everybody and I did a video on it actually and you Yeah I watched it well
(3:33) I watched the video i appreciate that man um I I'm I'm a little flabbergasted
(3:40) at how quickly you've run into the mainstream and and this is awesome like the fact that Pierce invited you on and
(3:46) got you on instead of the usual talking mouths blabbing heads um tell me a
(3:51) little bit about how you got to where you are now how you joined whatever and I'm sure you guys have heard it so you
(3:57) don't have to go into too deep a detail but just for my viewers so they kind of know where how they may not they may not
(4:03) actually know maybe this would be a good recap so uh most of the time when people are doing content streaming they stick
(4:09) with a particular field or venue that they're very comfortable with and that's where they stay and they they kind of
(4:16) all their content all that their commentary revolves around that specific field i'm not that way uh I debate a
(4:23) multitude of issues across the entirety of the globe with people from everywhere
(4:28) from all walks of life uh it specifically in regards to politics so
(4:33) what that did was it put me in a unique position to debate i've debated with uh the anti-religious on massive venues and
(4:40) gone viral there right and interestingly enough that entire crowd mostly is completely unaware of the debates that I
(4:48) have inside of the manosphere the manosphere is completely unaware of the debates that I often uh have which go
(4:54) viral on other platforms mainream so the way uh I guess I've been able to getal
(5:01) and out there so quickly is because my content's not regulated to to one
(5:07) specific piece of interest but rather it's an entire sealed worldview which
(5:12) goes up against other worldviews consistently across the board and regardless of the worldview be it
(5:17) libertarian be it um you know anti-Christian be it um you know all
(5:23) sorts of different things I'm I'm usually right there to do battle with those people so uh because of that I've
(5:29) I've gotten a significant amount of reach from various platforms because I'm a I'm a ski well at least apparently I
(5:35) guess I'm a skilled debater so you're a master you're a master debater master debater yeah I've heard that one a few
(5:41) times well you you've you've uh grabbed a lot of attention at least in kind of the
(5:47) men's issues stuff um not only with the whatever podcast but what
(5:53) um where you went online with with Piers Morgan and all that stuff and and I specifically I'll tell you what this
(5:59) adolescence TV show the the UK government for their part our media are
(6:05) at least our government's getting a little bit of a reprieve and a pullback uh but what drove me nuts about that
(6:11) interview and I don't want to talk just exclusively about it I but it's kind of the the headline that kicks off this
(6:18) conversation that everything everything nowadays is framed from the feminist viewpoint or the feminine the feminine
(6:25) yeah and and that the the moment that that we try to push back and say yes but
(6:31) we're living in a world of your framing and men that doesn't work for men you
(6:36) know this is you're you're you're not seeing things from our eyes and you and
(6:41) Tommy went at it and I noticed they make this link constantly between men incel
(6:48) men misogyny men uh Andrew Tate men you know they try to tie all these terms
(6:54) together to where anytime you're having a conversation about one it's like all roads lead to you know what I mean all
(7:02) roads lead to the Austrian with a little mustache now all roads lead to Andrew Tate and anytime you try to talk about
(7:08) anything they use him as the as the boogeyman yeah the proverbial boogeyman
(7:14) yeah so yeah well the thing is is like uh I don't even always disagree with
(7:19) things that Tate says to be perfectly honest i think that there's a lot of valuable things that the guy has to say
(7:25) and I think that there's a lot of things that he says that uh that I have some kind of starch or stark disagreements
(7:32) with but you are correct that uh what has happened is there's an effigy but
(7:37) this happens inside of the what you would call red pill or manosphere
(7:42) constantly there's a a new effigy which is put up and this effigy is supposedly
(7:48) the representation of this entire sphere even though as you know what the the the entirety of the manosphere is a loose
(7:55) confederation of various streamers commentators and uh political men's
(8:00) activists not really sourced as a single leadership top-down organization as uh
(8:07) the media would have you believe that the there's some sort of incel leader who's giving marching orders from his
(8:13) basement telephone and cell phone to the rest of the incel terrorists globally so
(8:18) that they may make women's lives miserable so it's it's it's actually much easier to take a mainstream figure
(8:25) like Tate create that as an effigy attack the effigy and therefore anybody
(8:30) who has similar views this is the same thing the left does you brought up the mustache man right this is the same
(8:36) point I think you're making how many times have leftists called right-wingers uh right they call him that
(8:43) constantly well you have the same view that uh that Germans had therefore you are this thing it's the it's the same
(8:50) type of thing i think it's uh it's completely ludicrous but it is a tactic which tends to work on the mainstream
(8:56) media side or at least it did before alternative media well I think it's it's it's a very it's a very charged language
(9:03) and charged word and you know when you think about it if you look at fascism at
(9:08) its at its root kind of beliefs and you look at national socialism which is what
(9:14) that beautiful little word stands for uh both are leftist ideology and so they
(9:19) they had to wrangle the language in the ideology at least in my opinion to move it back around to the right because most
(9:26) of the right is saying you know family small government at least now they're saying you know family small government
(9:32) bring it back to the home bring it back to either a religion or a religious base bring it back to ground zero and now the
(9:39) left is the ones that are you know at some points pro big pro big business
(9:45) like pharma you know during the that portion of it and then they're anti- big business if it So it all roots down to
(9:52) power if it if it's dude tush sorry my dog decided to um that if it's business
(9:59) that promotes the left big business is good if it's business that promotes the right same thing with millionaires same
(10:06) Yeah same thing with the millionaires same thing with government policy same thing with how does this start i mean it's
(10:12) already starting to break down but where do we how how do we ever reconcile this
(10:18) at this point with NOS's the same way that they uh they essentially attack us
(10:23) we use non-government organizations in order to uh basically mount a counter offensive so you know if you if if you
(10:31) really want to know the truth like t take organizations like the Daily Wire right why aren't they an NGO aren't they
(10:39) kind of a non-government organization which has political influence over the government is pushing their kind of
(10:45) various ideologies right yeah in a way I would say that they're an NGO but I don't think they fit kind of the classic
(10:51) think tank of that but alternative media itself is going to become these non-government organizational groups
(10:57) with political influence they're going to begin the kind of counteroffensive and already have been for the last six
(11:03) years seven years something like this but now the mainstream media is just on its dying death rows like the the amount
(11:11) of money these people are losing because one the lack of entertainment and b the production value of guys like me who
(11:17) have a basement studio who can pull live audiences which are larger than their anchors right um they can there's no
(11:25) competing with that at this point right so the alternative media is uh is
(11:30) definitely going to be having the kind of this this mainstream appeal mainstream push back even Pierce Morgan
(11:36) himself has moved from uh you know like kind of the CNN style over to a more
(11:42) kind of uh palatable uncensored style where you can get to the heart of more of these issues because it's more palatable for people to view content
(11:50) that way right it's more uh it's it's easier it's more palatable doesn't have the sort of same anxiety sense that you
(11:58) might get from the mainstream news broadcast and there's way less liability right so uh these these things are all
(12:05) dying out and uh good riddens right good like good riddens yeah i mean you think about like well like you mentioned
(12:11) production cost you're in a nicely decorated dungeon i am in a very boring
(12:17) dungeon so far cuz I just finished building my house our production cost combined is $4 and that's you know
(12:24) whatever moment the internet this takes up and our our electric budget although you do have a producer which I'm very
(12:31) jealous of that you can blame your problems on them because I have to eat that myself um but with I only got one
(12:39) so I could blame my problems on him i mean that's what else are they good for that might
(12:44) be worth a paycheck maybe I need to get a a quote unquote producer for a couple uh for a couple grand a month yeah but
(12:51) now now that I think that's you know we we've got Elon going in and tearing out some of these NOS's now showing the the
(12:58) government fraud and waste things like that but I it almost feels a little bit even if we let's let's say we go to
(13:06) the colleges today and we it we can't rip it out like it's the administrators
(13:12) it's the teachers it's now most of the students for the last decade pouring out
(13:17) of these now they're they're taking over the newest jobs the newest government
(13:22) positions the newest media the newest teaching every we've gotten so even if we cut things off today we're looking at
(13:28) 20 30 years before you know this a fresh batch of human beings with with without the
(13:35) ideology comes into half a century really about a half a half a century if we're lucky it's uh it's got to be it's
(13:42) got to be crossgenerationally done and there's no there's no way around that now if you think about it even from the
(13:48) time you were in school till right now in your life think about everything which has changed from that cross
(13:55) generation from the generation of your parents to uh when your dad was your age to the age you are right now this is not
(14:02) the same world right this is not even the same it it almost feels like it's a different universe altogether right the
(14:10) um the sort of metaeththics and the the metacon convos which happened in the United States these were not
(14:15) conversations that we were having when we were younger they were unnecessary these were just givens right nobody was
(14:21) confused about their gender nobody was particularly sexually confused and uh
(14:27) you know people uh people didn't have these sorts of uh of kind of dynamic
(14:32) issues which we see right now the whole world is a different place is like stepping into a different universe do
(14:38) you ever feel like that like you just have stepped into a completely different universe and it's uh it's it's almost
(14:45) bizarre right you live in Bizarro land and so if you have any sanity whatsoever
(14:50) I think you tend to stand out and um and that is a thing which is desperately needed I think yeah i I with today's
(14:57) society you know when when I was in school I don't think we I could I I graduated a class of 200 we weren't a
(15:04) big school was upstate farm country in New York and so the number of seniors that graduated from my high school was
(15:11) probably maybe 150 200 i can't tell you one kid that was gay not like I can't
(15:17) legitimately think of one and it's not that oh well they weren't allowed to come out or they didn't I I just I don't
(15:24) there I just there weren't any and you look at the social contagion and everything happening today and even if
(15:30) we get the money out of it even if we get everything out of it this next generation or two and you know so you're
(15:37) looking at millennials and Z although even though Z is correcting itself half of them are fried out and now we've got
(15:44) a 50% of our our populace is just mindwarped and brainwashed into this
(15:51) feminine just the lens that they look at the world and from this point this does
(15:57) give you the moment of like even though we have this resurgence and this push back they're just two groups that are
(16:04) going to be larger divided and I don't see a gulf across these two at least for
(16:09) the next generation or two you know I'm pulling up these videos and at this point I could just put every thumbnail I
(16:15) upload because it's hard it's the video topic is not the hardest thing uh finding the content can be tricky how do
(16:22) I label this thumbnail different than the world is absolutely insane and here's a bunch of crazy people that hate
(16:28) you and that could really be every thumbnail from here on out and and they would all be accurate right and and I
(16:35) just don't see I don't see that bridge anymore not only between left and right
(16:40) but between masculine feminine between men women between uh you know from the
(16:46) Smash culture let's just hook up on Tinder and Smash to the let's get married i I just do not see a coming
(16:54) together in the next 10 20 years i don't know how we bridge this well let me ask you a question
(17:00) do you think that uh when I when I look at millennials right people in my age group there does seem like there was a
(17:07) sect of men who were kind of saved from a lot of this madness because they went to war they were sent off to war and a
(17:15) lot of them came back and uh they became very politically active and they became very mobilized once they understood that
(17:21) the world is really a confederation of large tribes who are constantly killing each other for resources and everything
(17:28) that they had been told was a complete lie including the justification for why they were sent off to these wars to begin with uh I think that you could
(17:36) have a similar saving grace again and God help us all i think that it's even likely that the thing which will save or
(17:44) create this bridge and that when people go stop worrying so much about ableism and town policing and is when there's a
(17:52) bunch of body bags that start coming from an overseas nation from a war which was actually justified i think that you
(17:57) see most of this stuff go away and if you if you wonder about the disconnect right what can reconnect it i think that
(18:04) that's a possibility but I also think that we I I have some faith that gen Gen Alpha as um as young men are moving more
(18:12) towards masculine religion rather than the feminine sort of religion that we've been dealing with for the last 90 years
(18:18) they're moving towards masculine traditional religion i think it's going to be very helpful for future generations as well it's like it's not
(18:24) that there's no hope it's just that there's not any hope for guys like you and I right we're going to be fighting
(18:29) this war until we're dead and there's not a damn thing we can do about it that's our lot in life i'm just kind of
(18:36) okay with that uh the flip side is though is that we can leave the kind of road map behind for people who are
(18:42) coming and they are coming and I don't think that the insanity can last forever i don't even think that it's possible
(18:48) because society will just break oh sure the insanity is definitely not going to last forever because men will hit the
(18:54) breaking point you know we're here because men let women put us here and what I mean by that is you know female
(19:00) uh there was a video I was watching today three female officers that had nails like long pretty nails and their
(19:07) hairs up in little barretes were trying to were trying to arrest a guy and he just grabbed the top of two fence posts
(19:14) that was trying to take him out of a backyard he just grabbed the top of two fence posts and he said "Well let's talk about this." He Three women were yanking
(19:21) on him and he said "I'm not going anywhere till you explain what goes on there's nothing they could do." I mean
(19:26) at that point yeah they can you know they can back up and hit him with tasers or you know uh use some hole punchers on
(19:32) him but we're only here because men But even that's by his consent isn't it like when you when you really think about it
(19:38) even that even allowing them to hit him with tasers is basically done by his
(19:43) consent that there might be other actual men that he may have to contend with that become a problem right right right
(19:50) but and and the reason why I I only push back against your you know your war
(19:55) statement is look what happened in Ukraine or what is happening in Ukraine you know you've got the young men many
(20:02) of them did flee you but the rest of them are being you know put into conscription and going off and ending
(20:08) for their country and the women are in Poland and they're showing pictures of nightife and dating and dancing and
(20:14) these women tur twerking on guys graves and the respect for what the men have
(20:19) done even in this country for Ukraine being even in that country the respect
(20:24) for what the men are going through is nil and I understand oh well you don't you know the world doesn't stop when men
(20:31) go off to to battle but shouldn't it you know if you look at World War I World War II yeah the women had to take a lot
(20:37) of the roles in the factories and things like that uh to to provide for the men that were overseas but now because they
(20:43) had to put screws in packs i know it was a rough life h terrible wasn't it but but it's the it's always this the same
(20:50) type of thing where you have these apologists again looking at the world from the feminine view saying "Well what do you expect him to do nothing all the
(20:56) time." And it's like well you could do something that would at least show some appreciation for the men that are out
(21:02) there you know doing what they're doing instead of hooking up with foreigners in a in a nightclub in another country or
(21:09) even in one of your major cities and so it were that to happen here I what stops
(21:15) the women from going to the clubs what stops the women from nothing there's no place there's no place to flee so I mean
(21:22) I agree with you in a sense and then in another sense I kind of disagree so the sense I agree with you is the Ukraine
(21:27) conflict between Russia um is isolated now we we kind of want to make it larger
(21:33) than life but Ukraine's a very you know it's a very tiny place ultimately and
(21:39) all of the neighboring nations are available to flee to right so in a way there's like an agreement which is which
(21:46) is Ukra this is between Ukraine and Russia and that's it all these other places are neutral friendly zones what
(21:52) happens when there's no place to flee that was World War II that was World War I when the entire continent is embroiled
(21:58) in the war you don't get to escape you don't get to go to neighboring Poland and enjoy the clubbing night right there
(22:04) is no night life because they're embroiled in a war too uh global conflict is part of the nature of the
(22:11) 21st century i guarantee it just like it's going to be part it was part of the nature of the 20th century um the
(22:17) entirety of the world going into conflict I think is inevitable so part that's going to be a like a necessary
(22:23) condition of globalism i think that eventually um there is going to be global conflict that will embroil the
(22:29) entirety of the world and when that happens uh when not if that happens I
(22:34) think that uh all of these kind of subsequent nonsensical problems go away but if it doesn't happen you still have
(22:41) a crossgenerational road map to assist with um with the idea that masculinity
(22:46) is not poisonous that Christianity is not about the feminine that it's a patriarchal religion that it always has
(22:54) been a patriarchal religion that we follow a patriarch named Jesus Christ who incarnated as a man and that our
(23:01) priests are men not women that the um the entire structure of it is designed
(23:08) around the masculine not that feminine virtues aren't valued they are and women who have them are highly valued wouldn't
(23:15) it be nice if we had some though it be nice we had some of them but we don't right we don't have them so uh I still
(23:22) see that um that men are moving in the same direction they always have because
(23:29) they necessarily have the role of being the protectors in society starting at the family level all the way up to the
(23:35) national level women are supposed to have a counter duty to this called reproduction they're supposed to be
(23:40) moving in society towards the idea of family and reproduction and they're not there's a failure of duty uh deer
(23:47) election you could call it on behalf of may perhaps a societ greater societal contract uh which occurs you get all the
(23:55) security we get the kids that's the way it's supposed to work right well it's not working that way but men are still
(24:01) in the position of providing the security so if that's the case and we have a failure in this that needs to be
(24:07) rooted and addressed extremely quickly or there's not going to be a society for us to really be arguing about in the
(24:12) future anyhow well I agree I I although I I see us less I I see less the you
(24:18) know we go off to war versus whoever or I I think I'm more of the mindset and it
(24:25) at least it seems to me that you know the next conflict um that or the next I
(24:30) guess real um societal portion of of this in its next steps would probably be
(24:37) more more likely um a a continued societal split where you know the top 10
(24:44) or 20 perhaps even 30% of guys continue to have great success the the women chase them down the women only want to
(24:51) have their children they're the
(25:03) succ you know resources and income and the bottom 70 to 80% of men you know
(25:09) you're talking about hypergamy well yes but the the fallout from it meaning that
(25:15) there is going to be a large you know throughout history if you look the vast majority of men didn't procreate you
(25:20) know it came from That's correct about 40% that's right right and so I don't think that portion of it is new but what
(25:26) I think is new the marriage the courtship the financial benefits to a a
(25:31) country and a society of men that want to earn to support families and with all that breaking down I see guys more
(25:39) making enough to make themselves comfortable andor whatever they want for their own lives and less going out and
(25:45) becoming the earners women are trying to take that position but that's a that that's a that's a burnout statistic i
(25:52) mean most of these women by the time they get to 30s 35 40 they realize h this is a trap and I think we're just
(26:00) starting to see the first women that were raised in the I don't need a man i
(26:05) can have anybody's kid I want i can be the single mom i can handle it all those first women are now starting to hit not
(26:12) retirement age but the window where they realize okay much further than this I'm
(26:17) probably going to be on my own forever these are the women yelling on X about all the handsome good-looking successful
(26:23) 35 year olds hooking up with the 22 year olds and not looking at the other 35 those that's those women are just
(26:30) hitting that 35 to 40 window i believe we're going to start seeing the cascade
(26:35) failure of this whole movement by women no despite media movies people like
(26:43) Tommy Lauren and other quote unquote conservative women saying "Well men must do this and men I think men have seen
(26:49) the road map of this and they just have completely tapped out." Yeah I've heard uh something similar to
(26:55) this from proponents uh MGTTOW proponents for instance been going their own way um they kind of often cite this
(27:02) but I don't see it i don't see the evidence for this so um the millennials are past the that age you know they're
(27:08) moving into their 40s they're and the screeching harpy feminist women are still sitting there with their cats
(27:14) talking about how great life is right they're still scre screeching about how great life is when clearly it's not so
(27:20) great uh at least for these women i'm not sure that that will be the uh the
(27:25) motivating deal breaker the motivating deal breaker right now I see from if I take a bird's eye view and I'm trying to
(27:32) look at the political sphere for the next hundred years first of all that's really difficult to do but I'm just going to try just for like the sake of
(27:39) trying to sure the the first is that feminism has failed to fulfill its
(27:45) promise to women period anyway right it has not actually liberated them from anything it's just created debt slaves
(27:51) out of them they didn't used to hold any debt they used the husband carried all of the debt and the husband had a legal
(27:57) obligation to take care of their family or they went to jail right right and and the uh subsequent idea of the vote or
(28:05) the idea of women becoming um political actors took away all of their moral high
(28:10) ground you have to remember women were able to pass the 18th amendment before they had the right to vote with the 19th
(28:16) amendment uh which was the prohibition of alcohol and uh this so I mean they
(28:22) had plenty of political moxy they've just become a voting block now to be pandered to but if you look at the
(28:28) degrees that they're getting and the um they it's true that they out compete men
(28:33) uh when it comes to getting degrees it's like 69% I think it'll be 73% soon um
(28:39) that was the last stat that I took a look at that was more modern but they're not getting degrees in STEM in fact it's
(28:44) regressing right so over the last 10 years it's been completely stagnant in STEM fields and it's regressing further
(28:50) and in trades forget it they just don't even exist in trades uh there's there a statistical anomaly it's not to say that
(28:56) there's not some woman out there who's a skilled auto mechanic i'm sure that there is but who gives a [ __ ] there's so
(29:01) I mean it's such a statistical anomaly that it's just not even worth discussing right um they're not going to be able to
(29:07) take those jobs they're not going to be able to uh move into those fields so the
(29:12) the reliance on men is always going to be there there's not really anything that they can do about it but what
(29:19) happens then when there's a security collapse if there's a security collapse they don't have the necessary requisite
(29:25) skills to go do anything with infrastructure nor do they have the requisite skills to even defend themselves they just those are not skill
(29:32) sets that women have so the overt reliance on men is what happens when men
(29:37) say uh you know [ __ ] this uh how about no rights for you what do they what what
(29:43) is actual what is actually the possible outcome that they could do well let's look at the rest of the world nothing
(29:49) that's the outcome they can't do anything about it so you look at the rest of the world when they go you don't
(29:54) have any rights anymore right you don't you don't have them but what what type
(30:00) of collapse do you have to have to get there and it is going to be catastrophic
(30:06) population it's going to be a population collapse well the well so this is prong two so the population collapse we're
(30:12) under reproduction rate so we have to rely on immigrants coming in there how do you have 150 million people in the
(30:18) United States what 60 years ago and now you have 300 million and you look at the
(30:24) 30 years of mass migration progressions about a million people a year well they're not bringing in the values of
(30:30) feminism right the immigrants aren't coming in with the value of my woman's rights they're coming in with the value
(30:36) of uh screw this [ __ ] we come from a patriarchal society we're going to continue to have a patriarchal society
(30:42) here and you you're moving them into a democracy so they're able to crossgenerationally vote and it's like
(30:49) what happens if they just seize the system they just vote in the system it's like that's a really viable future i
(30:55) think England is going to be the test bed for that you know right now you've got this a matter of fact there was a
(31:01) new law st uh not a new law but uh stmer just came out today and in the UK the
(31:07) judicial system has come out and said they will uh have longer harsher
(31:12) sentences for everybody but people with skin color women and under the age of 25
(31:19) and when you go down through all the demographics really what they're saying is lighter sentence for these people or
(31:25) they could have just as easily said stronger punishment for white men specifically and and this is uh it's
(31:32) going to be several months till they can get around and review it but this is this is the irony and I think this is
(31:37) why England's going to be the test bed for this particular idea they they bring
(31:43) in Muslim they bring in many different cultures muslim seems to be the predominant they're definitely the most
(31:49) uh anti- all the things these feminists want whether it's the LGHD TV community you know why they have to bring in
(31:55) Muslims do you know why specifically no specifically yeah it's because the
(32:00) religious are the ones who reproduce so if you're going to if you're going to be pulling from nations you have to pull
(32:05) from nations which reproduce you can't The UK can't pull from France they don't reproduce they can't pull from Western
(32:11) Europe they don't reproduce they can't pull from the United States we don't reproduce you have to pull from reproducing nations so the Muslims say
(32:16) the womb is our weapon true and they're right true yeah they will uh I think in
(32:22) a certain townships already they're at 70 or 80% of the counties or townships in the counties in in the UK and I think
(32:29) there's going to be a tipping point where they're going to keep playing this game right up until they have enough for
(32:35) the majority and then in an instant it's going to be Sharia law feminism's out
(32:40) the window LGHDTV rights out the window and the UK is going to become
(32:46) a a Muslim territory i mean at that point and and there were and ironically the women will they'll flee they'll
(32:53) complain they'll whine there won't ever be the moment of well you guys did this to yourself like your policies did this
(33:01) there will be no reflection on that you were the deciding vote so fe this is uh
(33:06) so all futures that I see for feminism are feminism basically brings in the
(33:11) bleakest future for women I could ever imagine so it is true that perhaps under uh patriarchal Christianity they would
(33:18) not want you involved in political processes right as not as though that's a bad thing right there's a lot of men I
(33:24) don't want involved in political processes either because they're dumb as a box of rocks and they nullify my very informed vote right perhaps a one vote
(33:31) household something like this would be a great compromise but all roads of feminism lead to destruction of feminism
(33:38) itself so we start with the rule of empathy which is the uh the rule of vote
(33:43) by women right all morality comes from empathy first reason logic comes second
(33:48) in fact reason logic is only used to reinforce whatever the empathetic view is so uh I feel bad now I'll logically
(33:56) reconcile it i feel bad for you now i'll logically come up with the the reasoning behind why that's actually okay right
(34:03) instead of starting with the reason first we start with the empathy first uh so that model leads to generally mass
(34:10) migration things like this um be because that's that's how they vote well the
(34:16) type of immigrants you have coming in they don't like feminism so they destroy feminism it's like okay well that road
(34:21) leads to destruction what about a transhumanist future in the next hundred years well that road leads to destruction too what happens if we do
(34:28) have artificial wombs well traditionally what we can see in nations where there was a scarcity of children they selected
(34:34) for men yep why because let's say you have two different types of hum human beings that you are available to you and
(34:40) you can only pick one the first type of human being has trouble regulating their emotional clarity has trouble regulating
(34:48) their hormones and is significantly up to 60% weaker than the other type of
(34:53) human being right the other one right has no trouble with hormone regulation no trouble uh with uh with you know task
(35:01) of strength things like this well which one would you select for right right you you generally select for the male we can
(35:07) see this in China we can see this in tons of other uh societies where there's a scarcity of children if the option for
(35:12) selection was there they selected the male almost every single time so even if we had an artificial womb future right i
(35:19) don't see how that's good for women that's like that takes the negotiating power away from women now uh and puts
(35:25) the selection power in the hands of men so the very transhumanist future they wanted were the reliance on female
(35:32) murder bots to enforce their rights uh if we did have such a future it's not uh
(35:37) unlikely that we would have the artificial womb technology along with the technology of the quote murderbot which we're way far away from right uh
(35:44) that puts the selection hand in the hands of men and it's like that doesn't do anything good for you either so like
(35:50) all roads of feminism lead to women losing their rights absent them submitting to the patriarchy absent them
(35:56) actually giving a submission to the patriarch because they always have to appeal to the patriarchy in order to get
(36:01) the patriarchy to give them rights right no matter what so it's it's always circular right i have to appeal to men
(36:07) for rights uh so that I can have rights from men it's it's the wildest thing ever i I think you're missing the one
(36:13) though that I think will actually happen first which is more than likely if we keep going down this road whether it's
(36:19) in Europe whether it's here in the United States or whatever uh the the feminization of men and the uh you know
(36:27) no masculine role models and that toxic masculinity and men fighting and arguing
(36:32) and hazing and bullying and all these other things is going to make such a a generation of feminized weak emotional
(36:40) men that conquer would also be you know if if China I don't know what China's
(36:46) count is up to a billion what but there there could become a point where just the
(36:52) uh you know once you get past the drone wars as we'd likely have on the next one whichever one can't produce the way to
(37:00) defend themselves is ultimately yeah and it's ultimately at the mercy of its enemy well you look at the sheer number
(37:06) of people that you've got in in some place and I use China just because you know They're they're they're an easy
(37:12) target but they have the three or four times the number we have and on top of
(37:18) that I don't know what the percentage of our items come from there but if they turn off you know if they just quickly
(37:24) take over Taiwan turn off the chips turn off the steel production turn off all yes you can talk about their economy
(37:30) collapsing but if they just then wait for us to deteriorate enough that they can you know out produce us during the
(37:37) war which is one of the reasons why World War II uh we were able to turn factories around so quickly and we had
(37:43) this unlimited supply of of ammos and weapons and etc etc if they can shut
(37:48) that down uh they'll just walt in and there won't be a masculine man to fight them and they will impose their
(37:55) masculinity in in in a different way but nonetheless it'll it'll still Well Elon
(38:02) Musk rightly points this out that the uh crisis in reproduction of humanity is a
(38:09) global phenomenon it is true that right now China has you know over a billion people but they're actually slated by
(38:16) this the middle of the century to have only 500 million right their one child policy completely devastated their
(38:23) ability to uh repopulate their own nation they see that error and corrected
(38:28) it as quickly as possible but they're going to be feeling the effects of it south Korea is below one per woman uh
(38:35) and that's not going to change that's going to continue to dip in the United States will dip under on the average of
(38:40) one child per woman as well contracting its population as well uh Japan same thing massive reproduction crisis can't
(38:47) sustain its own population very xenophobic uh people in Japan rightly or
(38:52) wrongly whichever way you want to you want to call i don't think there's anything wrong with [ __ ] Japan wanting keeping their nation Japanese i don't
(38:59) think there's any problem with that but for the first time ever they need to perhaps rely on immigrant labor they're
(39:05) talking about bringing in hundreds of thousands of immigrants in order to assist with the thing that they
(39:10) desperately need the most which is elder care right and this is a big problem when you have uh you know less
(39:16) grandchildren than you have grandfathers or you know whatever the case may be um you you now have a significant problem
(39:24) when it comes to elder care so they're looking at that other nations are are beginning to look at that and where are they drafting them from well they can't
(39:30) draft these people out of the western nations or even the eastern block nations because they have a below
(39:36) reproduction rate so where are they getting them they get them from Muslim nations they get them from India right what are we talking about here h1b visas
(39:43) for who indians right still still a large reproduction rate there and the
(39:48) propaganda is all around like hey these are great people they're high IQ blah blah blah bring them in bring them in bring them in bring them in but I don't
(39:55) know if uh people are aware that uh in the Indian culture the uh the men there
(40:00) really misogynistic like really misogynistic not a big not big fans of
(40:07) this whole women's rights stuff you know they're not they're not very happy about it it's like so all of these roads lead
(40:14) to population collapse and population collapse then being kind of have you
(40:19) have to subsidize for your GDP and everything else on immigrant labor what choice do you have and uh women uh and
(40:26) their voting patterns basically will lead you to the very destruction of the very society that they wanted to be
(40:32) liberated in and bring in a group core group of people who then subjugate them it's this is like the wildest craziest
(40:39) thing ever if you want to know like how do you fix that well I think Trumpism is
(40:44) making some type of broad attempt to to fix this so Trumpism is like look um no
(40:50) more immigration right but he's failed on the promise of stopping mass migration and moved over to the Musk
(40:56) idea of H-1B visas that's really bad for us um the promises of the uh tariffs
(41:04) were supposed to be the same thing put us in a more isolated format he was supposed to do some type of structure
(41:09) from the top down on family dynamics he did a good job saying there's only two genders but he also needed to say things
(41:15) like we need a mass propaganda campaign for the family and for respect of men and that they have the rightful head of
(41:22) families because they're the protector class of society right these are all things that we need from the government level that we're not getting so until
(41:29) some of those things start happening there's not there's no end of in sight for any of this there's no end and if
(41:34) you notice all the countries that are struggling with repopulation and every single one of them is westernized and
(41:42) and uh it's it's almost feminism because if you look at uh I I occasionally do
(41:48) videos on marriage and um the the dating um events that they have in China
(41:55) feminism is leaked into China in itself that they're requiring men to have more
(42:00) property more money be better um to to be more financially uh giving but also
(42:07) be taller more attractive and and even that's leeched into socialist China that
(42:13) we're in a place where every westernized country uh and to the point where you
(42:18) know South America now you get down into Mexico some of the protests in Brazil that you see much on a much much smaller
(42:25) scale maybe they're behind where we are by 10 or 15 years but all of these countries have adopted feminism and
(42:32) putting women to the work world and making them not dependent on men and not see the the benefits and uh appreciate
(42:40) family and in every case women's their selfishness for lack of a better word um
(42:47) has allowed them to go rogue well not it's not just there uh North
(42:52) Korea so North Korea of all places well done done out of necessity uh there
(42:59) was a great famine there but yeah even in North Korea because there was a great famine which happened there men were
(43:05) giving their food to their you know their wives children things like this um the population of men decreased
(43:11) drastically and uh the Kim dynasty was forced to make a choice do we have a
(43:17) standing military or don't we because it's contracted in a major way and so they made they made the service
(43:23) compulsory and fe so feminism in in a way even there is leeching in the
(43:29) population dynamic and collapse of these various nations feminism is not helpful at all but is most often touted as some
(43:36) kind of solution and it's never it's never a good solution and it's never been a good solution and ultimately it
(43:42) must be resisted at all levels and there's no country who's unaffected by it and there's no nation have the well
(43:50) poisoned by it before the end of feminism itself which is going to be a requirement of finally um society
(43:58) shrugging it off and saying well you know these uh these ideas of egalitarianism and these ideas of
(44:04) equality between men and women that's exactly what they always were untrue ideas and ultimately when put into
(44:11) practice they don't work and they lead to the utter ruination and destruction of the nation so I think uh I think as
(44:19) the the road map becomes a little more clear here there's a lot to be concerned about but there's also some things in
(44:24) which uh maybe to take some joy in the fact that it is true that the religious are the ones who are the most likely to
(44:31) reproduce and it is true that the religious are moving towards more traditional forms of religiosity that
(44:36) gives me great hope for the future in the numbers game for shrugging off and destroying feminism on behalf of the
(44:43) patriarchy and uh you know that's a a long road map but uh but still one
(44:49) that's very viable for humanity well I think the the natural course is going to
(44:54) be that the um the the more right-wing the more
(45:00) religious the more people that are into family and teaching their children good
(45:06) um good moral lessons and and the religious factor of it versus the other side that wants to wipe out their own
(45:14) children before they're even born and um that will cause a rightward swing
(45:20) over time i guess the question is going to be will we will the I don't want to
(45:26) call myself necessarily conservative but will the will the logic-minded will the
(45:32) rational-minded have enough control and be able to uh will and will be able to
(45:38) control the narrative long enough to make this actually happen or will the
(45:43) the totalitarian or author authoritarian or feminism or whatever else because
(45:49) they're all almost tied together today will that grab enough power at a a
(45:55) various point to do enough damage that you know it's I mean just look at like we were talking about earlier the
(46:01) demographics are destiny demographics are destiny the thing is is like the
(46:06) demographics don't look good for women it doesn't look good it looks like the the sex in which you are the religious
(46:13) sects which are reproducing which you need to rely on uh are the ones who have a patriarchal infrastructure and and and
(46:21) a patriarchal ecclesiastical authority that they adhere to and it does not look
(46:26) good for uh for these women the the future looks very bleak it looks very
(46:32) bleak for uh for the numbers game for them well while I I initially might in
(46:37) the long term yes you know but within our lifetimes at least you I and everybody that's probably listening to
(46:44) this you know you take something as as simple as um Canada's upcoming elections
(46:50) you know you've got conservatives ahead by a decent margin and because Trump
(46:55) does some tariff things and they get into it a little bit now the left is ahead by 10 to 12 points then you look
(47:01) what's going on in Germany and you look what's going on in uh the UK and in France and in these other countries
(47:07) there is a real possibility they destroy themselves with bad with emotional
(47:13) response to what they hear in the news or what they see on Twitter or X or whatever there's a good chance that they
(47:20) they destroy at least what we've got going on now before we get to the
(47:25) correction and the turnaround wouldn't you agree i'm not sure it's a like it's on the
(47:30) edge of a knife i I want to in in many ways agree with the assessment and say look uh you know it's like it's a race
(47:38) to who gets there first what we're talking about what you're talking about is the ability of demographics to seize
(47:43) power right so which demographic seizes it first is it going to be the kind of
(47:49) conservative traditional-minded people who sees power inside of these various democracies or is it going to be the
(47:54) more theocratic types who get there first i'm not sure and nobody knows the answer to this very important question
(48:01) but what is true is that authoritarians are going to seize power through democracy and there's not enough numbers
(48:08) to stop them because the people who want are I don't know if you would call them uh liberty-minded or rightsminded they
(48:16) don't reproduce and if you don't reproduce you don't have the destiny demographics that you need to keep your
(48:23) nation intact and that's that so the authoritarianism is coming whether you
(48:28) like it or not there's not much that can be done to stop that at this point because um it's just a people's game
(48:34) it's a numbers game you know what I mean and they got them we don't it's that simple and we're not And until we do
(48:41) something about that until we look at this as a a top- down problem and eventually the government will
(48:47) eventually the military is going to say "Wait a second we're going to have to start doing something here because we
(48:52) don't have the bare necessity for the defenders required in the nation they're never hitting their goals they're never
(48:57) hitting their recruiting numbers they're always short people are washing out constantly and eventually they're going
(49:03) to have to do some kind of top- down birth rate program like Hungary has done and various other nations are attempting
(49:09) now to do in order to incentivize the people to even reproduce in the nation they exist in that's I mean that's
(49:15) something which not only has to happen it is likely it will happen but it to
(49:21) your question I don't know nobody knows the answer to that question just yet i guess
(49:26) I I try to I try to break things down into um I try to figure out time frames i
(49:34) mean that to me is usually the most important if X happens what are the next four 10 20 30 years look like and and as
(49:42) far as I can tell right now this next generation while they are this is the first generation I think gosh maybe
(49:49) since boomers that have now hopped back and started to become more conservative than the previous ones um somewhere
(49:56) along the line I think men and men and conservative and logic and
(50:04) resilience and intelligence needs to have a resurgence to the point where
(50:10) they actually show up they actually vote they actually talk about the issues the leave me alone i just want to go into
(50:15) the woods and escape forever you you can't do that because the activists that
(50:21) are that want to control this system are coming out and so you know me personally
(50:26) we you know we often joke around about oh we just go John Golt or move into a cabin in the middle of the woods but I
(50:32) think that's disservicing the next generations to come because there is we
(50:38) are in a battle this is a war whether you want to call it the war of culture the war of feminine versus masculinity
(50:45) the war of authoritarian versus whatever they want to call it you know freedom uh
(50:52) uh democracy which has been a pirated word you know there's a point where you
(50:57) say well we got to fight and I don't think I don't think anybody that's the
(51:03) freedom well not anybody but I don't think enough freedom loving freedom-minded people have a battle plan
(51:10) have a game plan i I just think they they're reactive to what the other side does but by then you're you're a step or
(51:17) two behind and I I don't know how we we motivate andor amass to make some
(51:24) changes in both socially and politically well you do it through political part
(51:30) not just political participation but by meeting the enemy on every single battleground you can possibly find them
(51:36) on and eviscerating them every single talk show where their stupid little safe spaces are where they feel like they get
(51:43) the words and then you talk and then you talk go get right in their stupid faces go get right in their faces call them
(51:49) what they are a bunch of dirty feminist scumbags who are responsible for the damnation of the West and tell them that
(51:56) they need to get off the program they need to get out of here they're worthless they're useless they're mouth breathers and they're idiots on top of
(52:03) all of that right and not just me not just you not just you know a few men men
(52:09) in mass need to do this the crucible I think has has in some ways uh been
(52:14) pivotal in training the next generation of great sophisticated patriarchy-minded
(52:20) debaters who can make really great arguments designed to destroy the opposition's worldview logically and
(52:27) also appeal rhetorically to their emotion yeah right and you need to have a combination of both you have to reach
(52:32) both sex right those who are emotionally minded and logically minded so the thing is is like you need to attack on all
(52:39) fronts all the time non-stop with participation the men going their own way going their own way to do what you
(52:46) know what I mean how about instead of going your own way you get in the way that's what I want to see get in the way
(52:53) of these people who are obvious lunatics leftist lunatics feminists i mean
(52:58) there's monsters everywhere and it's like why aren't we fighting with them like and boy and but by the way that's
(53:04) also fun right it's also fun to fight with these bastards well sure sure especially on social media when you show
(53:09) them into the dirt but I think I think I think that's one of the the
(53:15) misconceptions of men going their own way it it doesn't necessarily mean they go John G it just means I've decided I'm
(53:22) going to live my way the way I want to live and it doesn't mean you don't and again it's not necessarily a movement
(53:28) but a philosophy where it's I'm I'm going to live my life the way I want to live now if I want to live and have a
(53:35) wife I'm gonna have a wife but she's gonna follow my masculine lead if I'm gonna have a girlfriend you know now
(53:42) many men say "I'm not going to get married and put myself at the at the mercy of the courts by doing anything legally but I will take a woman into my
(53:48) life and if she screws around and she messes up and she's not following what I
(53:54) feel is best interest for me and a family unit out you go." And so yeah my
(53:59) I guess my attempt wasn't to uh try to straw man the position of mtau uh like I
(54:04) understand that many of these kind of proprietary definitions get used and abused and beaten up on and
(54:10) mischaracterized and this kind of thing and that's not what I'm trying to do obviously you're much you're much more
(54:15) familiar with what the kind of core meanings of that is i guess I was just making like a tongue and cheek reference
(54:23) like you know in in in don't let them even hijack the language right if you're
(54:29) a man get Yeah not only get involved but the men's rights activists and and advocacy groups they actually have a
(54:36) good push and a good leg to stand on now we have tons of data now for how children actually need dad in a big way
(54:44) we have the data now that supports the fact that women are abusers and that
(54:49) when the the father's not at home the results for the kid is terrible and that the results for kids who were raised in
(54:55) single father households generally they're better we have a big leg to stand on now to make these arguments
(55:02) from both my view the Christian view or perhaps the migtau view the manosphere view there's a lot of of things which we
(55:08) can kind of come together on here for the purpose of a more kind of patriarchal masculine type of society
(55:14) and sure these ideas uh need to be thought about incessantly and everywhere that these stupid feminists have their
(55:21) little spaces you know their little cluck talk shows and this get in there invade them you know what I mean don't
(55:26) let them have a moment's rest don't let them have a moment's peace you know and do the same thing that these bastards
(55:31) have been doing to us for 60 years don't give them a breath don't let them even take a breath i I think the way the men
(55:38) are doing it young men are doing it today and and I I know you weren't being disparaging towards guys going their own
(55:43) way um because in many ways you're right but I think the younger generation uh at
(55:48) least when you look at Gen X we were definitely checked out of politics we were checked out of social issues cuz
(55:54) everything was good you know everything made sense everything was sane and I think the deeper we go into this the
(56:00) more that you're finding whether it's men's content whether it's religious content whether it's conservative content whether it's freedom uh you know
(56:08) uh libertarian whatever it is you're seeing more and more of this push back and but this is the the and I want
(56:16) people to understand the the type of fight that is coming up because whether you watch um Charlie Kirk debating
(56:24) leftists whether you watch uh uh um Michael Nolles going on and arguing with
(56:29) these you know college feminists or whatever or Ben Shapiro or whoever or you watch my content or
(56:35) yours this is a perfect example we have proven now and I I'll just use this
(56:40) because it's a universal one that's very easy to understand we have proven why the the wage gap exists hours worked
(56:47) extra shifts overtime men having second jobs men having a stronger drive you
(56:52) know we can put into actual studies and numbers here's why there is a disparagement in pay and it has nothing
(57:00) to do with with equal job this that we put it all out on paper and then you hear Barack Obama come out 15 hot
(57:07) minutes later and you know uh mainstream news and feminists and everybody else
(57:13) just perpetuating the lie even though we have the studies i think we're in a place now where we can definitively
(57:19) prove that men need to be in kids' lives and that uh you know fathers and
(57:24) masculinity we can prove all of this and then not only do you have the dummies up on the mainstream news but people like
(57:31) Tommy Lauren and other conservatives coming out and fighting back against us as well and there's a certain point you
(57:37) have to say we're arguing with idiots we're arguing with people that do not use any logic they refuse to step back
(57:44) and see the nature of the world and they will continue until everything falls
(57:49) apart yeah that's true but the you know the nature of here's the nature now in the
(57:57) 21st century is that we're in an information war massive information war
(58:03) and really when you take a step back and you think about what it is that you do what are you doing all day you're correcting information right you're
(58:09) correcting bad information you're correcting bad talking points you're you're correcting information that's
(58:15) that is what you are doing but the way in which uh we can engage in combat now
(58:22) in the verbal age in the data age in the information age is debate debate in ver
(58:28) is the new form of verbal combat and in the information age it is the tool and the weapon of the man and the more
(58:35) logical the man the more likely it is that he can change the hearts and minds of the lunatics who exist but even if
(58:42) you can't change theirs you can reach their hundreds of thousands that they reach on their own platforms and you can
(58:49) siphon away from the madness and I get thousands upon thousands of messages from various people have done exactly
(58:55) that you've done exactly that how many Let me ask you this how many emails or DMs have you gotten from people who
(59:02) literally just said this i never [ __ ] knew any of that [ __ ] right right they literally just say those words like I
(59:08) didn't know any of that how did I not know any of that how and then they feel
(59:13) lied to right and then what happens right they are they also become part of that um characterization of correcting
(59:21) information so that's the effect that you have so it's like the more reach on these shows that you can get to in order
(59:28) to correct that information the better off we're going to be right that's that's the way you fight the fight you
(59:34) you basically are speaking of the war of attrition you just you just keep swallowing up 0.01 or 0.2 or whatever
(59:42) percentage and and bring them in and then hopefully they keep disseminating the information and then they become one
(59:50) that will or uh that will then speak that information isn't that what the
(59:55) communists did to us pretty much i mean pretty much yeah pretty much they pretty much did the exact same thing i'm just
(1:00:00) talking about doing it in reverse yeah yes attrition absolutely attrition as I often say in the middle of a before I go
(1:00:07) on TikTok to do an invasion right many of you may not make it in this conflict but that's a risk I'm willing to take
(1:00:13) okay that's a risk that I am willing to take right um the thing is is it is it
(1:00:19) is an actual war the uh kind of dynamics for the social war have changed it's no
(1:00:25) longer as physical as uh combat like this may have been in the past but it doesn't matter the tools and weapons at
(1:00:32) our disposal now are logic reason data correction the ideas of also the
(1:00:38) humiliation that you can put and produce on lunatics like Tommy Lauren who you
(1:00:43) ask them what is the equivalent duty for women uh that men have when it comes to protection and they say nothing it's
(1:00:50) just innate in you you like doing that [ __ ] you love it it's your favorite you wake up in the morning and the first
(1:00:56) thing you think of is "Well I got to go protect me some women." And like "No we don't lady." Not not only do we not
(1:01:01) think that lady right but also nobody wants to do a bunch of uh objectionable
(1:01:08) self-sacrifice for a bunch of ungrateful bratty you know uh uh I I hesitate to
(1:01:14) say the word i don't know where you're streaming to but [ __ ] right catty [ __ ] who are like "Well yeah I you
(1:01:20) love the protection role it's your it's innate you were born with it you know and it's like well what are you born
(1:01:27) with nothing i just look I just look hot look at me i look hot and and that that
(1:01:32) is the that is the crutch that these women eventually have is that you know men require um and and I think this is
(1:01:40) actually the battle for the soul of the country if if I had to use a word it would be for the soul and because what
(1:01:47) feminism has done is confused women to the point where they not only want to be men look like men act like men but they
(1:01:53) want to take the roles of men up to a point and then they'll go no further and
(1:01:58) what they're running into now is that they're going to they're going to ostracize themselves
(1:02:06) to such a degree that young men today and well and even older men at this
(1:02:11) point really are are are they've women have changed society to the point where men are now accepting
(1:02:19) to some degree that they're equal now do the do we really think they're equal uh
(1:02:24) different and equal and blah blah blah well sure but no because again that there's the physical portion men will do
(1:02:30) the jobs women women won't do men men are basically the ground level of everything the society is built on the
(1:02:36) backs of men and were those men to go away everything would fall apart in an instant but the women refuse to see that
(1:02:43) and so I think society at the bedrock level will be fine because guys will continue to do what we need to do
(1:02:48) because we have to we have to survive we have to get along no one gives us bailouts and the rest of it but what I
(1:02:54) think is happening now is is men are seeing the nature of of women and men
(1:03:00) are saying you don't bring and this is what we were dis you were discussing on the Piers Morgan you're not offering
(1:03:06) virtue you're not offering virginity you're not offering femininity you're not offering a stay-at-home mother
(1:03:13) you're not offering being a wife and a good mother to the kids and being a a teacher and educator in the home that's
(1:03:18) what a lot of men a a massive amount of men actually want and instead they're
(1:03:25) getting argumentative angry women that say "Well I bring money." Well that that does me
(1:03:31) no good because money doesn't come from the women to the masculine men it only goes outwards so it goes Yeah it goes
(1:03:38) down from them to the women right women women tend not to share their wealth and men tend to share their wealth isn't it
(1:03:44) interesting how that works and when they do share it they [ __ ] 100% you owe them you know it's
(1:03:50) like a loan it's like a loan with interest on it but the thing is so funny is um like what you're saying is
(1:03:56) descriptively true but one of the things in the the red pill space is I try I've
(1:04:01) always tried to engage very good in very good faith with people who advocate for red pill positions or mikttow positions
(1:04:07) because I think that I need to really understand the arguments of what it is people are saying why they're saying it
(1:04:13) so I can even reason if what they're saying is true not true this and that so the way I view the red pill is I view it
(1:04:19) as a set of social descriptors not prescriptors there's no prescriptions really it's a data packet it's kind of
(1:04:25) up to you what you do with this information how it's straw man is they say now the red pill is Andrew Tate or
(1:04:32) the red pill is Rolo Tomasi the red pill is this guy the red pill is that guy they are the red pill the red pill is my
(1:04:38) gains it's not a sequence of individuals but a sequence of descriptors for descriptive reality so that people can
(1:04:44) uh can take that information and do what needs to be done with that information but what do we do prescriptively right
(1:04:50) that's that's really the questions like the manospheres existed a long time but what prescriptively do we move to well
(1:04:56) we move to a social crusade The social crusade is where we need to be moving collectively and the social
(1:05:03) crusade needs to entail like if there's a line that you can call that one of these feminists has for the little talk
(1:05:09) shows or the little like call them to give a piece of your mind tell these broads what's up you don't have to take
(1:05:14) a single step back ever and by the way part of the social crusade you can do it you know you get off of work you're on
(1:05:21) your way home give the show a call tell them what you think you know what I mean you don't have to take any [ __ ] from any
(1:05:27) of these people there's reasons why you shouldn't in fact one they're reallying stupid two their prescriptions are
(1:05:34) terrible for society and three you ain't going to have a society unless you start moving towards a prescriptive social
(1:05:40) crusade to change this stuff and the way you're going to do that right now is by blitzing the media and we can do it and
(1:05:48) they can't straw man the positions of everybody and some of us are very articulate and can easily with ease
(1:05:54) slice and dice these people into nothing and we're not and but we need to be we
(1:05:59) need to be and we need it in the worst way well I think uh and I agree with you and I think that you know the red pill
(1:06:06) started out red pill manosphere etc started out i I I can't even put on a
(1:06:12) date on exactly when it started out but even Tom Lus back on the AM radio was was talking about a lot of these issues
(1:06:18) and so many times it it gets um it it gets it it gets tossed out as a a
(1:06:24) porative or a negative and in reality when you start breaking down kind of what men are asking for and the men that
(1:06:32) are in men's spheres manosphere red pill etc what they're really talking about is
(1:06:38) traditional and conservative even more so than people that call themselves
(1:06:44) traditional conservatives i'll give you a good example uh you take someone like Michael Nolles speaks quite openly about
(1:06:50) religion speaks quite openly about um family units and health and all this
(1:06:55) other stuff and then he goes out and interviews this Nalof fitness who's an only fools worker twice who said she's
(1:07:03) converted to religion and and he platforms her and then you've got people like myself and others on kind of this
(1:07:10) side of men's issues that says "Why are you talking to her why are you platforming somebody that is absolutely
(1:07:16) awful instead of somebody that has some real values that has always been a role model and because you're trying to treat
(1:07:24) this woman as a as a win because she somehow converted yet is still doing thirst stuff on on TikTok when you
(1:07:30) revenge well sure you realize it's revenge so the idea So one of the things I've called the Daily Wire out from
(1:07:37) massive platforms and told Nolles and these guys I'm happy to do a 1 v one debate my live viewer count's way bigger
(1:07:43) than your guys' anyway it's like you're not losing anything by doing this right um so why not why not let's have a
(1:07:50) tangle let's have a live debate on these issues they refuse they absolutely refuse to do it but because of that kind
(1:07:56) of innate cowardice which comes out of that organization where they just won't refuse to engage unless they can just
(1:08:01) straw man the position right they would rather take the effigy hang the effigy up yell at the effigy that's a really
(1:08:07) safe thing to do really difficult when the effiges yelling back right when he's like "No that's wrong that's a
(1:08:13) mischaracterization of the position here's what's actually going on." Can you respond to the actual argument then it becomes something altogether
(1:08:20) different doesn't it so the thing that's so interesting about this is that um I
(1:08:25) think that there's forms of social revenge which various organizations do against like the quote manosisphere
(1:08:31) things like this i can give you uh stories on this in fact um Brian Atlas of the Whatever podcast who has good
(1:08:38) relations with the Daily Wire has tried a multitude of times to set up a massive red pill versus the tad conservative um
(1:08:46) you know kind of viewpoints like let's let's just hash this out let's do a six-hour debate like we used to do in
(1:08:52) the old times right let's really get these issues on the table total refusal right right right the Charlie Kirks and
(1:08:57) TPUSA of the world unless they can have a resistance-free policy I've destroyed so many TPUSA feminists at this point on
(1:09:04) the various programs I've lost count right if they can't have a resistancefree no push back environment
(1:09:10) they're just not very interested and the thing is is like so keep pushing like keep pushing till they can't ignore you
(1:09:16) keep pushing until they must have the confrontation then necessarily they'll have to start changing their views they
(1:09:22) don't have a choice because you can't argue with what's true right you got you can't and you you being a debater as
(1:09:28) you've stated like that's kind of your you're you're famously a debater the the
(1:09:34) men's communities that kind of whether you're doing what I'm doing or many of the hundreds of thousands of others at
(1:09:39) this point we were born in adversity like we're born what not literally but
(1:09:45) you know you merely adopted it but uh but when you think about it like
(1:09:51) when I started my channel and many others started their channels to start to grow in uh we were we're labeled everything in
(1:09:58) the world were called all these names and we had to argue every single point that we have in the face of adversity
(1:10:05) and we have to prove data that shows why our points that we say what we are and
(1:10:10) even they get misconstrued that oh well they're just incelss they can't they're not where many of them are married many
(1:10:17) of them are conservative many of them have many other views they're just not adopting what's being spoonfed them and
(1:10:23) I think because of this aver adversity and because of this struggle
(1:10:28) to to speak out the points i think that's where we want the debates we want the discussions we want the arguments
(1:10:35) and whether it's conservative whether it's um uh liberal or leftist or socialist or
(1:10:43) religious or whatever so many of them just refuse to be uh to have that
(1:10:50) conversation because they're going up against someone that was forged in fire you know that that has had those battles
(1:10:56) had those arguments has the data has the knowledge and at any point if you start
(1:11:01) calling them out on any of it bringing the the math the maths and the data and
(1:11:07) the logic behind it I think most of them fall apart at this point yeah and and they do well you're right you're listen
(1:11:13) not only are you absolutely right but I don't even think you know how right you are here so the the truth is is that the
(1:11:20) these these tradons the trader side right and the representation have been so resistant to
(1:11:29) engagement inside of these spheres whereas I had complete ease of access
(1:11:35) when it came to engaging with the manosphere in debate in uh in
(1:11:41) argumentation in things like this in fact they couldn't wait yeah bring it on right bring it on and now there's plenty
(1:11:48) of pickup artists scumbags and things like this who I've decimated and there's plenty of actual feminists inside of the
(1:11:53) manosphere too male feminists um who basically you know they're they're part of the promiscuity crowd and left-wing
(1:12:01) men benefit from feminism in a big way right because they like to have sex with lots of chicks that's that's like their
(1:12:07) stickick and sexual liberation's been great for them so of course they mobilize behind it and want to continue
(1:12:13) to push it up that form of of societal degeneracy but they have been willing to
(1:12:18) like let's do this and by the way if if you're uninformed on something or this isn't what a thing means like let me
(1:12:25) give you some clarity here's what we're actually saying right and if you're un if you don't straw man their position
(1:12:31) and allow them to lay it out right you find wait a second there's there's a lot
(1:12:36) more here than perhaps once we thought you know what I mean now it's not to say all the descriptors are correct it's not
(1:12:42) to say that everything that's coming out of these fears is right because it's not but it is to say that it needs to be
(1:12:48) contended with in a big way and they're they're just they just refuse to do it and it's because you hit the nail on the
(1:12:54) head if that happens the worldview shatters it falls apart and most of the
(1:13:00) base of this is based around egalitarianism the ideas of egalitarianism and this begins to
(1:13:06) shatter the picture the perfect picture that you have of the egalitarian society
(1:13:11) that never really was right right and and ironically you know so many whether
(1:13:17) you want to talk about communities or news or media or whatever comes out and attacks and I don't like the term red
(1:13:24) pill to be quite frank with you um nor do I I like the term manosphere but because it's been so poisoned now by it
(1:13:32) gives you a but it gives you a reference for what we're talking about right and and it's it's hard because now you know
(1:13:37) and and this is this is something when you did your your video there and I I keep referencing this one because it
(1:13:44) just went so viral is because when you when you have people arguing with you
(1:13:49) and they say that they tie the words of incel and and um andrew Tade and uh
(1:13:56) manosphere and feminist and or misogynist and all these words together so tightly they do that as a as a
(1:14:02) protection mechanism because once you really disseminate what we're discussing
(1:14:07) without you know doing the straw man without propping up false idols like
(1:14:13) Andrew Tate you realize that it's not it's not a solid thing it's just like
(1:14:18) saying well religion is X well there's a whole lot of different religions out there and here you know kind of red
(1:14:25) pillow manosphere whatever has been thrown into all these different whether it's uh uh and like you were mentioning
(1:14:32) the the the dating coaches versus pickup artists versus men going their own way
(1:14:39) versus tradons versus really it's it's a a a multitude of different flavors of
(1:14:46) ideas and when you really start boiling all them all down really most of it
(1:14:52) comes to the lack of respect for men the lack of uh accountability and ability
(1:14:58) for for men to do what they need to do and the feminization of everything and and that really cuz if you look at the
(1:15:04) pickup artist it was men used to ask out women and men used to desire women men
(1:15:10) used to want to date women and now they've changed it into a game because the women changed the game if a woman
(1:15:16) required an engagement ring if a woman required a man to have a good job if a woman required a promise for forever
(1:15:23) before she slept with a guy boom dating pickup artist gone instantly that it's
(1:15:28) it's just obliterated and guys would be doing videos on here's how you get the best job and here's how you find the
(1:15:34) best flowers for a girl like you know that would all change and so really at
(1:15:39) the heart of it it's just a massive amount of men that are saying "I don't
(1:15:45) like society i don't like what you've done with it i I don't think we're headed in a good direction and here's
(1:15:51) all my problems with it and here's how to game it and here's how to use it against them." And and that's really all it boils down to is a bunch of
(1:15:58) disenfranchised guys that say "You've broken absolutely everything." And we're
(1:16:03) trying to figure out either how to game the system or how to fix it or how to change it or how to escape from it
(1:16:08) that's really what it all boils down to yeah how do I win or how do I escape it's and the escape is the win right and
(1:16:16) so look there's a lot of what you're saying here that I agree with and ultimately I think though again these
(1:16:22) are descriptors like you're giving great descriptors this descriptively is what's is what's happening i agree with that
(1:16:29) what I'm looking at I'm trying to look past that into the prescriptor right one guy I talked to about this Myron Gaines
(1:16:36) interestingly enough um he you know that's he he looks towards prescriptors
(1:16:42) now you may not agree with any of his prescriptors right but he's still looking towards the prescriptor what do
(1:16:47) we do about it right and I just don't see any other way than a social crusade
(1:16:52) and the thing is is like and here's the thing Joker [ __ ] these people like you
(1:16:57) don't Why do we need to escape why do we need to escape like like you know like beat the hell out of them every chance
(1:17:04) you get verbally you know I'm talking about verbally and in the arena of ideas but like just kick the holy holy tar out
(1:17:10) of these people on on all these TV shows everywhere but we but we are and here's how we do it here's how a lot of the
(1:17:16) guys are doing it how's Disney doing how's Hollywood doing right how's Well I think Yeah disney Disney didn't do very
(1:17:22) well this last game up did they right but but when you look at Disney Hollywood um HBO Onstream Paramount
(1:17:31) these these TV networks um sports shows sports shows that started talking about DEI and feminism the the a lot of the
(1:17:39) ways to fight back is and and this is where I think a lot of guys have gone and and I agree with
(1:17:46) you there there are people out there that say this is what we need to do and that's that's one prescriptive but
(1:17:51) there's another prescriptive and and it's really in in essence the easiest one okay um Marvel's went woke i'm not
(1:17:59) going to watch they need my money i'm not going to give it to them uh same thing with this car company same thing
(1:18:04) with this same thing with this so what a lot of guys are doing they're not necessarily leaving society i think the
(1:18:11) guys going their own way or whatever they've been "Wow I'm just not going to interact with this stuff anymore." We're
(1:18:16) very present uh you know I'm I'm one of the first one that says I boycott just about everything including Coke for
(1:18:23) their anti-whiteness campaign four years ago haven't sipped a Coke since right
(1:18:29) pepsi is better anyway but but I'm not sitting here having a podcast although I I have done you know I've I talk about
(1:18:37) these topics but there's a lot of guys today that say "Well there's many ways I can win this i don't think I need to go
(1:18:44) out and have a I don't think I need to go out and have a protest i don't need to go out and put a video of my own but
(1:18:50) I'm I'm going to save my money and not waste it on first dates with women that just want to use me for and I'm I'm not
(1:18:55) going to buy these products from companies that hate me and instead I'm going to buy some land i'm going to buy
(1:19:01) a house i'm going to maybe learn how to farm and that's just one extreme example but others are just I'm not going to go
(1:19:07) to the Hollywood movies anymore i'm going to use my money as my vote and they still vote but even if it's just
(1:19:15) quietly uh if it's quietly what seems to be passively not participating that is done
(1:19:22) more in many cases than people screaming and to give a good example is um whether
(1:19:29) you look at uh well Bud Light had a lot of screaming but very you know very quiet things where people just say h I'm
(1:19:36) not going to say anything about this but I'm not going to go watch this movie uh I'm I'm not gonna say anything about this but I'm not going to spend my money
(1:19:41) with this company anymore look I totally agree with this point that the boycott the ideas for the boycotts and the
(1:19:48) various things which are going on when people make garbage you don't go see garbage right that makes complete sense
(1:19:54) to me the idea of the v kind of voting with your wallet has always been a great
(1:20:00) power that society has right in order to shut down social things that we don't like we don't appreciate this and that
(1:20:07) but we're also dealing on the flip side of this with massive NOS's which will
(1:20:12) fund $3 billion movies you know or whatever uh with the message even
(1:20:19) knowing that they're going to flop because they don't care right because they these people are ideologues they
(1:20:25) don't care disney took the Star Wars franchise and completely destroyed it right and they're going to continue to
(1:20:32) completely destroy it and the thing is is they're always going to have enough of this kind of external sourced money
(1:20:39) sometimes even foreign money who is interested in the weakness of the United States uh to continue to produce this
(1:20:45) garbage now maybe you don't go watch it you know what I mean but there's enough people who do and so I'm I'm not saying
(1:20:50) that that uh methodology doesn't work it's great i'm like more power to you i'm glad that you're doing it i'm saying
(1:20:56) that we can have a multi-pronged approach here where some of us are great at at some aspects and some aren't but
(1:21:04) either way it's all fighting the same fight on a social crusade for the advocacy of change on behalf of men and
(1:21:11) on behalf even of women who need to begin to adhere to their social duties
(1:21:17) right like this needs to happen the irony the irony is that you take someone
(1:21:22) like myself and many others that are in again this type of arena whether you want to call it guys going their own way
(1:21:28) red pill manosphere whatever most of us that are most vocal about this absolutely love women that that's what
(1:21:35) they never understand is that it's not that we hate women it's what we we hate
(1:21:40) what women are doing and we hate what they've become and they we don't want them to be what they are now because now
(1:21:48) They're undesirable and they're broken and so many Yeah sure you can picture
(1:21:53) yourself at the edge of a cliff and there's an endless line of women who are jumping off of it and the next one comes
(1:21:59) up and you you go over and you're like "Look look at all the bodies down there oh my god they're all dead look for your own eyes it's terrible this is Don't
(1:22:06) Please don't jump off this cliff at the bottom of it you're going to be smashed into oblivion and they go and then the next one comes up and you say that you
(1:22:12) try to make the same arguments you're trying to stop and then they go right and it it's this kind of like ongoing revolving door but here's the thing it's
(1:22:19) nice occasionally you get to steal them out of that line right you get to grab one and go "Let's get you out of here." True true and and most of the time they
(1:22:25) don't just jump off they look at you call you misogynist first then they jump but well they jump well halfway down
(1:22:31) they go "You did this." You did this
(1:22:36) well the the you know not all men um not all men are going out and getting in the
(1:22:41) faces of women and and there is an argument to be had that uh yes going out
(1:22:47) and screaming in their faces but did Tommy did Tommy change her and this is the way I think maybe is the correct
(1:22:53) framing of this did Tommy Lauren change her mind because of you yelling at her no but did many of the people watching
(1:23:01) Right exactly is did many of the people watching and maybe that's the key to it
(1:23:06) uh you know as many of these weirdos as many times as Hollywood fails with the NGO money and all the rest of us no
(1:23:13) matter how much we yell at them we may not change their minds but maybe the sane people listening and the people
(1:23:19) that are on the fence or the as you call it the knife's edge maybe we can pull them off and that's one way to look at
(1:23:24) this the other way and this is something that is my contention that I think works very well is that we've many men today
(1:23:33) are taking the boycott like we and this was the kind of what I was bringing up before but they're taking the boycott
(1:23:39) and they're extending it to romance they're extending it to marriage they're extending it to dating they're extending
(1:23:44) it to working for companies who they don't align with and there's I think going to be a renaissance of bluecollar
(1:23:52) guys that can make 100 grand being the electrician the welder the the technical guy because so many people are going off
(1:23:58) to college and wasting their money thinking that's that we actually have a shortage of bluecollar men i think
(1:24:04) there's going to be a resurgence of maybe not this generation but the next
(1:24:09) generation of women that see these crazy women out there doing all the crazy stuff in their 30s and 40s talking about
(1:24:16) the guys they're hooking up with and talking about hookup culture is they're 45 and overweight realizing well they're
(1:24:22) not happy i think there's going to be a a large boycott by men in general of
(1:24:28) just a lot of things they don't agree with and while that in and of itself may not be a get inyour-face moment and it
(1:24:35) may take a heck of a lot longer it's at least the minimum people can do that want to push back against this you don't
(1:24:42) like Only Fools don't subscribe to it shame everybody you know that subscribes to it call them a loser call them out
(1:24:48) make fun of it are you going to save everybody no because Bonnie Blues still does a video and 100 guys in Bak
(1:24:55) Balaclavas show up to masked sleep with her you know you're not going to save them all but the more we can talk about
(1:25:01) the absurdity the more we can show it out the more we can make women hate the market they've made by boycotting or not
(1:25:09) participating i think all of it is battling the fight on every front we have i think that's the big the big
(1:25:16) thing sounds a lot like a social crusade my friend it it is it is not maybe not
(1:25:22) so many words but it is it sounds an awful lot like a So and here's the thing right hasn't it been a long time coming
(1:25:27) anyway like it's been a long time coming anyway and if these people are going to be fruitc cake lunatic um you know
(1:25:34) crazies we might as well have some fun with them while we're at it you know what I mean there's no reason to let
(1:25:39) them run rough shod and like you remember that gay dude who was on right this this gay dude's on and he's he's
(1:25:46) telling me about what masculinity is and what the dynamics are between men and
(1:25:51) women right it's like dude you've never Women don't owe you anything and it's like well here's the thing right then I
(1:25:57) don't owe them anything right and ultimately right the the the thing is so
(1:26:02) ironically hilarious about this is how is it that the other two social conservatives are here backing up the
(1:26:08) gay dude's opinion right who's a complete leftist and among among other
(1:26:14) things and it's like look get real screw this and the optics for you people is terrible anyway it's awful you might be
(1:26:20) able to point at me and say hey look maybe that guy swears a little bit too much he smokes on stream sometimes i like to have a few drakes on stream too
(1:26:27) and it's awful but you're dealing with societal destroyers here right and so
(1:26:32) it's like you know maybe I'm not the uh kind of perfect messenger and neither are you but uh but that's what we got
(1:26:40) right that's what we got and and the poisoning against masculinity is so strong and so ingrained into everybody
(1:26:48) that you've got conservatives now yelling at men that are in some ways
(1:26:54) more conservative than those men are and you've got them lining up with the the
(1:26:59) feminists on the left to attack to attack us and and I think that's why we don't get the debate feminists on the
(1:27:05) right the feminists on the right who who pretentiously pretend that well uh what
(1:27:11) what I I I heart the patriarchy you know why I heart the patriarchy because you
(1:27:16) can do all sorts of [ __ ] for me and I'm going to let you and that's what a real man does you do a bunch of stuff and I
(1:27:24) am going you get to watch me benefit from it like a real man and it's like what the clip and and I I don't have the
(1:27:32) clip pulled up um but the the part that Tommy said that really like blew my mind
(1:27:38) i was yelling at the I the funny thing is if you watch my YouTube video it was like 30 minutes my actual live stream
(1:27:44) was about two hours it was about two hours on on Rumble thank you sir and and I edited so much out of it because I
(1:27:50) just I just was raging and and and not nonsense it's not like I was going in gibberish but the what where my anger
(1:27:58) stems from is the the passive way that so many people just assume you need to
(1:28:05) do this because this is the way it's always done wait a minute for men but when we say "Yeah but what about women
(1:28:13) this is what we want from women you owe us something." It used to be you gave us
(1:28:19) something being a mom being a stay-at-home mom being the mother to my children and we stayed together taking
(1:28:25) care of a home whatever it was you at least gave something and now today no
(1:28:30) matter how conservative or feminist or whatever a woman is you listen to some of these women on on uh pod whatever
(1:28:37) podcast they say "Well I want a man that's that makes good money and he's tall and he's he's handsome." Well why
(1:28:43) do you want tall and handsome well he's masculine he's protective okay so he's protective he provides for you are you
(1:28:51) coming with What are you coming with well I'm funny don't care my dog's funny uh uh I'm good company so's my dog um I
(1:28:59) bring money not my money uh I bring I'm I'm fun to hang out i got f Like everything they bring is nothing to men
(1:29:07) they they've lost so much uh they've lost touch with what men want so much
(1:29:15) they don't even understand us anymore and the more you have you have you ever seen a creator named Homath yeah oh yeah
(1:29:22) yeah yeah yeah so Homath he had a he had I talked with him quite a bit he's a nice guy and he had this great video
(1:29:29) where he was he was talking about this specific phenomenon right what do you bring to the table and he's like "Women
(1:29:35) say I'm the table." Yeah yeah they say "I'm the table." Right well but here's here's the counter right it makes no
(1:29:42) sense if if you have a friendship with another man and you do everything on one
(1:29:48) side of that friendship and they don't do anything wouldn't you consider that a really toxic bad friendship like a
(1:29:54) terrible friendship would you stay friends with that person of course not of course not how would it be or you say
(1:30:00) "Well we going to have a marital relationship right?" Right but but I
(1:30:05) wouldn't even treat my friends this way you know like my friends should have higher expectations of me than my own
(1:30:13) husband has for me it's like what well the irony is where these young women get it twisted and not even necessarily
(1:30:19) young youngish even those in the 30s and now 40s where they get it twisted is they they they say "Yeah but um when men
(1:30:27) say because men have always put up with women and and what I mean is there are things about a woman that we know it it
(1:30:35) just is women are going to cry women are going to be emotional women are going to complain women are going to look to you to be the entertainment director women
(1:30:42) are going to you know you have to do a lot for a woman and in even in the modern era at least we looked at women
(1:30:48) and said "You know what but you're still pretty and I get to sleep with you a lot i'll I'll I'll call it a draw if I want
(1:30:55) someone to hang out with or understand me or know what my deal is I'll go talk to the guys." But now women are even at
(1:31:01) this point saying I I'm gonna sleep with everybody uh or I already have slept
(1:31:07) with everybody or I'm not going to sleep with you because I don't owe you anything and I'm not going to take care
(1:31:12) of myself anymore and on top of that uh just about everything else you you expected or wanted from a woman is going
(1:31:18) away but you you still need to put up with us and then when men hear not only all of this happens but she can also
(1:31:25) leave and take half that's where so many guys are just like I am this is just not for me anymore something is broken in
(1:31:31) the system well as we wrap this stream up before I let you shout your channel out and all that good stuff right i hope
(1:31:37) everybody goes and subscribes over um I just want to say a couple things first thing is is that I was listening to
(1:31:42) Joker's content long before I ever became a content creator which I had no intention of doing it was pure happen
(1:31:49) stance that I got into this arena at all um but I was I I used to when I would drive between different jobs um I used
(1:31:57) to I'd throw the the YouTube videos up i always thought that you have a pretty even killed analysis and then you know
(1:32:04) another content creator is a kind of an older one in the um I guess manosphere
(1:32:09) um Sandman you know who he is oh yeah can I give can I give you my Sandman impression hey guys
(1:32:17) hey everybody Sandman here today we're going to talk about why the woman always
(1:32:22) can't get out of bed before 8:00 sandman but this video comes from in part from a
(1:32:28) viewer and the viewer said "Hey Sandman can you talk about why it is that women can't get out of bed before 8?" That's a
(1:32:35) great idea viewer and thank you very much for sending that in i just I that guy um I always listened to him i I
(1:32:42) didn't agree with all that many of his takes but I just thought he was hilarious like just objectively hilarious so um I guess I guess kind of
(1:32:50) a shout out to that guy i always thought it was pretty funny well I I'm I'm glad that maybe I had a small influence into
(1:32:55) you actually yelling at the crazies out there um yeah Sandman i've done some
(1:33:01) I've done some actual interviews and live streams with him he doesn't talk like that at all on a live stream it's
(1:33:07) just whenever he gets into a video he gets this very unique cadence and and
(1:33:12) but he was one of the ones that actually he's been doing it him a guy named Turd Flinging Monkey that has now escaped to
(1:33:19) the far corners of the web because uh he like you just yelled at everybody and he had some very interesting takes uh shall
(1:33:27) we say he got chased off of YouTube and Rumble didn't exist at the time um there's so many guys out there that if
(1:33:34) you want to go deep into the rabbit hole and just be angry about this situation and yell there's guys for you and then
(1:33:40) if you want to come all the way up to the surface level where you're like "Well I like women i I I actually
(1:33:46) appreciate them and I just want them to be different and I'm gonna instead of yelling at the world I'm just gonna make
(1:33:52) fun of them because we're in such a then you've got other content creators so there's all all of this you do both well
(1:33:58) yeah i I Well and you shouldn't and you know like um I know you don't mean the characteration just this way but not
(1:34:04) really yelling as much as I'm just having an argument like a logical trying to have a logical argument with people
(1:34:09) and often times they actually start yelling which is hilarious um and I I just got to point out like this doesn't
(1:34:16) what you're saying doesn't make any sense and it's silly and how can we possibly have this as a tenable position in society like what are you thinking um
(1:34:23) but let me break in real quick before you go because I do have one thing that I I I you probably heard it since you
(1:34:28) watched my video on this that I was yelling about it but I do want to re-emphasize it anytime they bring up a
(1:34:34) Mottton Bally or a a straw man argument and they try to bring up all these
(1:34:39) buzzwords and they throw in Andrew Tate next time tell them okay Andrew Tate
(1:34:44) is he is a figurehead only he's not what a lot of guys you know a lot lot of guys
(1:34:52) have a lot of different issues leaving Andrew because it's almost like well what's wrong with with uh uh Republicans
(1:34:58) they say Trump okay don't argue for Camala you know or argue for Camala not
(1:35:03) against Trump next time they try this when they start saying Andrew Tate massage okay take the bad guys out now
(1:35:10) what about the good men the good young men the people that want to fix this what What about them that's who we want
(1:35:17) to talk about today you know that's I I did I did hear the commentary uh I don't know if you've been on like um like
(1:35:23) shows like this where there's narrow narrow time windows but the one the only problem that comes up when you do that
(1:35:29) when you say "Okay we're not talking about Andrew Tate he's he's only a figurehead or he's this or it actually
(1:35:34) shifts the conversation over to now we're having a meta argument about Andrew Tate now I have to listen to
(1:35:39) their response about no actually he's in charge of the and then we end up in a debate over Tate and I can't get to any of the damn points I want to get to all
(1:35:46) it ended up being is everything referenced to Tate anyway everything Well that's that's true but I was able
(1:35:52) to use my time wisely to dive into the points I wanted to get to as quickly as possible and just ignored the nonsense
(1:35:58) let's get to the point as quick as possible so I think I while I agree with you totally agree with you i'm just
(1:36:04) saying that inside of these kind of opportunistic windows where you only have so much time and you got to make it
(1:36:09) really count I have to be very choosy about what things I address or don't address and what things I ignore or
(1:36:15) don't ignore because otherwise it'll actually bog the points down i can't get to the things I want to talk about three words and this is always a great thing
(1:36:22) to throw into your repertoire is blah blah blah aside okay Andrew Tate aside
(1:36:28) bang and go right to your point and then if they keep referencing him you said "No no I'm not talking about him andrew
(1:36:34) Tate aside uh you know Camala Harris aside Democrats aside whatever just throw in those three words and then move
(1:36:41) past it and you'll what it does is if they keep referencing that person you said I'm not talking about that person."
(1:36:47) It makes them look like idiots not that they need help not that they need help but true but then they keep trying to
(1:36:53) reference what you've already said i'm not talking about it everything just gets everything gets exposed and they
(1:36:59) just collapse yeah yeah i I understand what you're saying um you know it's uh there's never there's never even if you
(1:37:06) have the perfect viral clip it was never actually the perfect conversation and you always have to make sure that you
(1:37:12) you pick and choose what it is that you're saying for the purposes of the constraint of time to try to make it as
(1:37:18) effective as possible not every decision you make with your words is going to be the perfect one uh but all I can do is
(1:37:23) kind of assess the situation as quickly as possible based on the opponent
(1:37:31) damn you internet i had no I have no idea they don't ever tell me and I don't care i'm just like bring them on um but
(1:37:38) I have to make the assessments very quickly and um so that's you know that's kind of what I'll say there and no no
(1:37:44) arguments no arguments i I just you're such a a master debater uh master
(1:37:49) debater that you can by the way for your audience who's watching um and for mine um I only had this up on YouTube it'll
(1:37:56) be off of YouTube as soon as I'm out of here you can only get this exclusively this interview then from Joker on his
(1:38:02) channel you're not going to be able to watch it over here so why don't you tell them where they can find that well I I will put it on YouTube highly edited and
(1:38:08) redacted because [ __ ] YouTube uh you can go to Oddman Out on Rumble um and you
