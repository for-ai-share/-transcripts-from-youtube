(0:52) vote for i'm 40 i voted for Trump good afternoon by the way good afternoon um Trumpless MAGA equals
(0:59) white supremacy do you agree or disagree i disagree why well first I haven't I
(1:04) haven't seen you bring any compelling evidence of uh YT supremacy plus no one
(1:11) can actually make the argument as to why they believe that this is inaccurate
(1:16) like explain to me why that's just an argument from incredility that doesn't give you legitimize your position hey
(1:22) hey Andrew hey Andrew pay attention i'm paying attention so you would have you
(1:27) would have to make the argument as to why you disagree with your claim why do I need to make an argument against your
(1:33) claim this is how a debate works if you disagree with it you would have to give evidence or any information as to why
(1:40) you disagree with the fact that I did because there's no compelling evidence of it that's my that's my argument so if
(1:46) you got if you have compelling evidence then tell me what the compelling evidence is andrew that's going to be
(1:51) your argument right that you just haven't seen anything there's no compelling evidence yeah okay uh so
(1:57) let's talk about the fact well I'm going to ask you what does the slogan MAGA mean make America great again okay so
(2:05) what are we talking about make America great again when was America great for everyone and not just rich white te
(2:11) white people yeah so the problem with this is that you're strawmaning the position of what MA said that's not a
(2:17) straw man can you answer the question i don't know how I'm supposed to answer it when you mute me when I'm in the middle of answering it so you you're
(2:24) complaining yeah so So I'm going I'm trying to answer your question let me You're complaining and not answering yeah okay so the answer is he's talking
(2:31) about the economic systems which were an occurrence where you could have a single family income and support an entire
(2:37) family this type of thing he's not alluding to race in any capacity and never has by the way okay okay so then
(2:46) are you trying to refer that the economic system was great under Trump
(2:52) uh no no i I told you what MAGA was what that's referring to you understand
(2:57) that's a reference to the thing you asked me has nothing why I I have no idea why you're going down this path now
(3:02) I am asking you are you trying are you saying in any way that ma that the
(3:09) economic system was greater no I didn't make any of those claims i told you that there's no compelling evidence that
(3:14) Trump is a YT supremist do you have any evidence do you believe in that though
(3:20) that the economy was great under Trump why does it matter what I believe for you to prove your claim because we would
(3:25) have to go into depth about Yeah let's go into depth for the evidence for your claim so So do you think that they come

(5:28) caveman i need I need you to support your claim you brought up the economy
(5:33) which is why I'm asking you that i didn't bring up the economy you asked me what MAGA was was a reference to the
(5:40) economy no I you asked me what MAGA was you asked me what MAGA was a reference to okay fine i'll just be muted was the
(5:47) economy good under Trump yes or no not evidence for your claim i want to change the topic very slightly
(5:54) what well yeah i want her to give me the evidence of her claim of YT supremacy the topic of the debate that's what I
(6:00) want yeah so how about we do this how about we You can't just say you don't have evidence hey listen listen how
(6:07) about we do this i'll give you evidence as to why my claim is my claim if you
(6:12) could answer me do you think that the economy was good under Trump uh well
(6:18) that's a loaded question one but two uh it's not a loaded Well I need to know what you mean by good what do you mean
(6:23) by good what do you mean by good i just gave you the a proposal do you
(6:29) think that the economy Let's say That's not a proposal that's a question that's not a Okay yeah that's a question it is
(6:36) a proposal it is a proposal no it's not a proposal yes it is no it's a question i'm telling you it's a question your
(6:42) question if you answer mine that's not a Okay so wait a second what does anything
(6:48) that I think no okay the economy under Trump was bad now can you provide evidence for the YT supremacy thank you
(6:55) can you provide evidence for it now sure so when we talk about YT supremacy we could talk about the fact that Trump
(7:01) refused to rent to people of color market their applications with C which indicated color the fact that he pulled
(7:07) out a full page ad calling for the death of the Central Park Five kids the fact that he said about Kamla Harris that she
(7:15) must have changed to being Indian to black um these and also let's not forget
(7:20) the fact that he said this is America where we speak English and not Spanish a very xenophobic remark so yes we could
(7:27) say white supremacy right there because white supremacy also ties with racism
(7:33) yeah do you see the do you see in your proposition there it says plus MAGA so this would be Trump plus MAGA equals YT
(7:39) supremacy so how are how hang on hang on can I ask the question i can't even ask the question okay i I already know where
(7:46) you're going yeah you already know the question that I haven't answer asked yet okay we could talk about how MAGA as a
(7:51) group defends that they didn't see racism as a problem when they voted for him and the fact that they think that
(7:56) make America great um is going with Trump the fact that Trump took MAGA from
(8:02) um from previous people and then took it for his own slogan
(8:08) yeah okay so I'll address each one of these claims one at a time if you don't mute me oh oh you you don't want me to
(8:14) address the claims okay go ahead yeah you have to stop muting me you understand that right you can't you
(8:20) can't mute me while I'm trying to answer are you Are you crying no it sounds like you're the one crying keep muting me
(8:27) you're crying cuz you're crying about the fact that I'm that you're muting me when you ask me a question i'll take
(8:32) I'll take each claim one at a time i know you have to mute opposition cuz you're a woman that's your fault though
(8:38) so anyway so very quickly on the on the Trump thing each one of these claims down on the apartment uh nonsense right
(8:45) this is highly contested hey Lily let's address his not absolutely not allowed to answer right you're going to cry you
(8:52) need to address that oh you're crying you're crying you're going to cry about misogyny now because you already
(9:03) Yeah like but guys I I love you i love you guys i don't know why you keep muting me i love you why you Why do you
(9:10) got to keep bringing up the fact that I'm a woman though well why do you keep going want to keep up bringing up the fact that you meet with people and then
(9:15) say they're crying and then when I say when I say anything about you being a woman you cry you said "Hey hey hey hey
(9:21) Cro." The fact that you brought up the fact you said "Well you're a woman that's why you're muting me it has to be
(9:27) that's the only logical explanation for why you're muting that's not because you can't because you can't provide evidence
(9:32) for your claims there's men who also mute people in Tik Tok so why why I
(9:38) believe Yeah do you have evidence what's your evidence for that claim he's
(9:43) not a woman what's your evidence for that claim he's not He's not a woman who
(9:49) uh Tomage well did you just assume his gender thomas are you a woman no oh I
(9:55) just So I disagree i think he is oh okay let's address that okay let's address it
(10:03) you're weird okay where do you get that from just your voice you sound like a female to me oh yeah i mean don't cry
(10:11) though who's crying i don't know he sounds like he's crying us or the person
(10:16) who's complaining that he gets muted because he has absolutely no idea what he's talking about
(10:22) and you know what you know what you know what still crying still crying you're still crying i'll do No one caresry

(12:47) I want to go with you know yeah why why you think Trump sexualizes his daughter
(12:52) [ __ ] up a year of stock market gains oh now you guys care about the stock
(12:57) market you care about the rich now suddenly the rich i'm not talking about the rich i'm talking about the fact that my
(13:04) parents [ __ ] lost a year yeah 90 So so 90 90% of the stocks owned
(13:11) by what by how many Americans would you say do you not know what a [ __ ] 401k is yeah I know exactly what a 401k is
(13:18) it's part of market volatility but the thing is is answer my question who holds the most amount of wealth in stocks 90%
(13:25) of it who other businesses and the wealthy yeah the wealthy now suddenly you care about the wealthy huh what the
(13:32) [ __ ] now suddenly what now suddenly the left cares about the wealthy i thought you wanted to put massive taxes on the
(13:38) wealthy yeah i thought you were tired of them playing the market and screwing over the little guy now suddenly you
(13:43) care what hold on Andrew where where where the hell did you came you came from left field right now
(13:51) what are you even talking about i'm having an engagement with this gentleman's position what's wrong with that well no i I want to know what your
(13:59) position is to be honest yeah I think that Yeah my position Well well first of
(14:05) all I'll give you my position but I was engaging with his my position is that tariffs are absolutely fine in fact
(14:12) they're necessary and here I can just I can just Hang on hang on i can make a demonstration for this that's That's
(14:18) really simple you ready Andrew i I want to know what your expectation level is
(14:24) uh me wait wait I don't want to talk i don't
(14:30) want I want to just stay on politics and stuff like that i really don't I have aational appeal to you why you believe
(14:39) Well yeah why you believe that the way the stock market is aiming towards right now isn't a wasn't detrimental to the
(14:46) poor or anything like that wasn't what it's not like basically basically not
(14:52) harmful to the poor or let's say the average American yeah but who it's the mo It's the most harmful to the top 1%
(14:59) not to the poor no it isn't yes it is that's not true okay well then tell me how many stock How many stocks and bonds
(15:05) do you think poor people hold in comparison to the wealthy it isn't necessarily just a fact yeah but I
(15:11) understand that at least 90% of the I understand that 93 or like 90 some percent of the wealth is held by the
(15:18) rich but that doesn't matter percent of Americans that has lo No it doesn't because if you do because if
(15:24) you're an average working person who's just put money in stock and you lost majority of it that is a signific that
(15:29) is a problem yeah but here's the thing the rich the rich will always get their money back the rich will always get that
(15:35) money back if you're under that 90% you don't get you will not get that money back so Okay so So hang on so I'm not
(15:42) allowed to respond okay no I don't I don't mind you responding i don't Yeah I know i'm not allowed to respond i get it

(18:50) evening sir how much have you had to drink tonight how much is Where wait where did she go where' the nice lady go
(18:57) she probably she probably got disappointed she gonna have a really bad hangover in the morning scared of the
(19:02) patriarchy i invited Patricia all right you guys um All right Andrew continue to I forgot
(19:09) where we was oh we were talking about how suddenly the left is really concerned about the rich losing money in
(19:15) the stock market for some reason go ahead yeah yeah yeah so so anyway uh so
(19:21) I think the idea of trade deficits and uh the idea that um that we have to
(19:28) compete with China who who will be or will out compete us the next 20 years if we don't start having a trade war with
(19:34) them actually to offset the deficits that we have with them now uh that's going to disproportionately affect the
(19:40) poor in the future in a way that um that this kind of market dip could never even
(19:46) hope to achieve yeah but isn't a trade deficit though can that also be uh
(19:52) considered like a strong economy also though sometimes in in a typical way yeah sure it can but that's not the case
(19:58) now even though we are in a trade deficit well it kind of is i mean America has always been in a trade
(20:04) deficit but we but No no no no no the deficit is No no no this is reverse like
(20:09) look our deficit is that the Chinese hold a massive deficit against us
(20:16) meaning that we are importing way more from them than they're importing from us
(20:21) that's the deficit that's what we're trying to correct here but that's partially our fault as well
(20:27) yes I agree you know we sent our businesses over there totally agree with that too so and I I get it we do need
(20:35) tariffs and everybody needs tariffs that's where that's the way the world makes their economy i don't really like
(20:40) the way he doing it but I do understand the concept and um just like they were
(20:45) saying you know it hurts the poor people it does it hurts rich people more now but it would like think about it in a
(20:53) year or two these poor people can go and they can get more stock cuz it's going to be at a bottom and it's going to go
(20:59) back up it's always go it it it it has to go back up i ain't going to say like it can't get worse it can always get
(21:06) worse well and you're right too because the market the market's driven by speculation and so they're just
(21:12) speculating against tariffs that haven't even gone into effect right they're just speculating so if you want to blame
(21:18) people for the the huge market dip you can blame these talks top stockholders
(21:23) to begin with because they're basically running pump and dump schemes they're using the hysteria around this to
(21:29) convince people to come off of their stocks so that they can buy them up for cheap that's exactly what's happening
(21:36) that that's exactly what's going on the the rich people are are waiting to the stock drop and they're going to buy as
(21:42) much of it as possible because they know it's going to go back up yeah and it's it's the left-wing media speculation
(21:48) which is causing this artificial panic so it's like you know I don't know why suddenly the left cares about poor
(21:55) people they're the ones driving this panic and I'm I'm gonna say to somebody I
(22:00) don't think it's the poor people driving the panic and the problem with the ter runs off of a global Yeah but the
(22:06) global No but the stock market also runs off global fear also consumer you know consumer spending all that stuff like
(22:13) when the market fears a certain thing that is going on let's say the trade deficit that is going around or give to
(22:19) multiple countries and stuff like that that can cause fear within a global market that also will tank our market
(22:25) also it will tank um China's um Vietnam everybody's going to fall that's not a
(22:32) good thing that's not a good thing y'all look here's here's what's going on
(22:37) that's Andrew the moment he put a pause on it it skyrocketed yeah going back to the market tariffs on China
(22:45) le stagnant but it started falling yeah listen speculators speculators use NGO
(22:52) groups who hire economists to go on mainstream media channels and predict
(22:58) doom and gloom and then what happens when they predict the doom and gloom is that average Joe comes off of stock
(23:04) because they're terrified of the doom and gloom rich people swoop right in and buy that [ __ ] right up it's calculated
(23:11) and orchestrated and the left are a bunch of fools they the Bernie Sanders crowd pointed out that these people do
(23:18) this non-stop but suddenly when they're doing it under Trump it's like oh no this is all Trump's fault it's like not
(23:24) really it's a speculators market based on panic so I think that uh when women
(23:30) are referencing a pickme it's not that it's a woman who is seeking validation from men but rather a woman who gets
(23:36) validation from men whether she's seeking it or not and this in turn makes women extremely upset because they don't
(23:42) generally get validation from men well the term pick me itself is like pick me
(23:48) so yeah I know and then they get but what makes the other women mad is that they get picked that's what makes them mad right that's the point is a shaming
(23:56) term it's like doesn't make them a pickme though because they have the validation cuz I
(24:01) do know that women get triggered by Pikmis so does a simp make you mad like
(24:07) what do you think about simps uh well I don't understand what you mean by mad like if you point to any societal ill
(24:14) does that mean you're mad or is it just something you like to say so you can be like "Are you mad bro?" Like what is No
(24:20) I was I was just referring to like men cuz they like typically call out other men and say that they're simps and stuff
(24:28) so So here I I'll I'll tell you the difference when a man's calling another man a s he's saying that this woman is
(24:34) not deserving of validation and you're giving it to her when women are calling another woman a pickme they're saying
(24:40) this woman is getting validation which she deserves from men and it makes me mad that's the difference but who are
(24:45) you to say if anyone needs validation well who are you to say anything i mean who are any of us to say anything we're
(24:51) both We're both giving opinions and our assessments on the situation neither of us are mind readers but we can definitely assess what we see right
(24:57) right but I just assessed what you said and you said that No no no you're not assessing what I said i'm saying what I
(25:04) Hang on that makes no sense hang on hang on this makes no sense though if saying I'm trying to assess what you
(25:11) say then steal man position validation to a woman she does not deserve that validation
(25:17) question is to you that's why other women call her a pick me who does not deserve validation yeah but see what you're doing yeah but see what you're
(25:24) doing is a bait and switch you're like who are you to say that well who are you to say it you're we're both giving We're
(25:29) both Hang on hang on hang on we're both giving a speculative opinion on a thing like who are you to say anything about
(25:35) anything it's just your opinion on it based on what you observe right or do you have like a magic book where you can
(25:41) read people's hearts and know what they mean by things okay so let's let's assess the word pick me then um can
(25:47) someone define by whose definition by whose definition though do I get to pick a definition too google well
(25:55) Google's not defining things google's pulling definitions okay so this says
(26:00) that a pick me woman is a woman who actively seeks validation from men often
(26:06) by presenting herself as not like other girls and downplaying typically feminine
(26:12) traits essentially trying to be the woman that men would pick over others
(26:17) usually at the expense of other women yeah do you understand what That's not right that's first First of all do you
(26:24) understand what a proprietary definition is so the thing is is like I disagree
(26:29) with this definition i'm giving you a proprietary definition i'm telling you that my observation is that perhaps that
(26:36) is what the word uh means definitionally from what from what your perspective is or whatever authority you're appealing
(26:41) to what I'm saying is my observation is that when this word is used by women it's being used by women in order to say
(26:47) there's validation which you've earned coming from men and it makes me mad yeah it's a shaming tactic it's it's it's to
(26:53) make women feel bad it's not to make women feel bad but you seek validation whether you have
(27:02) it or not if she has that validation good for her i know it's you guys are saying it's to make women feel bad but
(27:08) how do you feel when the man says that you're a s so is that not the same no
(27:14) it's not the same do would you like me to explain i'll explain it again so that you understand there's a distinction here when a man is calling another man a
(27:21) s he's saying this woman has not earned anything for which to validate her and
(27:26) you're doing it anyway generally because you just want to have sex with her like that's generally what's going on when women are doing this they're not saying
(27:32) this to other women because they think women want to have sex with that man they're saying it because she's getting male validation and it upsets them that
(27:39) they're not getting male validation oh sorry okay there are women who get male validation who aren't seeking it and
(27:45) those aren't pickmies so you're making you would be validation you would be
(27:50) either way you'd be making my point so because the woman's perspective here is this is unearned validation it makes
(27:57) them upset and so then they call this woman a pickme that just because they think she doesn't deserve the attention
(28:04) then they say she's seeking the attention like let me give you some key examples of this let's say a woman puts
(28:10) out an article that is promale okay this doesn't happen very often but occasionally there are academic women
(28:16) who do she'll often get called a pickme even though all she's doing is getting validation from men who think it's
(28:22) earned because they agree with what she's saying not because she's seeking specifically the validation of men do
(28:28) you see the distinction i see the distinction but there is also a difference between a woman who's seeking it and a woman who's not we're typically
(28:35) not calling women who are pickmies the ones that are not seeking the validation of men women who could care less about
(28:41) what a man thinks but still get that how do you determine that like how do you how do you know if they're actively seeking it or not yeah if I saw women
(28:47) like I would agree with your point if I saw seek validation from if I saw women
(28:52) who were like half clothed all over X getting called Pikmis by other women then I would agree with you but that's
(28:58) not ever what I see instead I hang on hang on hang on instead hang on hang on instead what I see is you go girl you're
(29:05) a girl boss live your best life girl blah blah blah blah blah when I see a woman instead give like an academic
(29:11) assertation or a dissertation or an opinion that is pro man in any way shape or form that's when they seem to call
(29:18) her a pickme not when she takes off half of her clothes and says "Look over here look at me look at me." Then they go
(29:24) "You live your best life." So it doesn't seem to add up that your uh definition of pick me actually applies in reality
(29:31) yeah so a pickme again would be someone who is seeking the validation so again
(29:37) if that woman is on X or wherever she's on versus a woman who is fully clothed
(29:42) either way it goes neither one of those women care about that man's opinion and earlier when it was stated that a woman
(29:50) who not humiliates other women but puts other women down for the validation of that man that is considered a pickme i
(29:57) applaud any woman who is doing what's best for her but if you're putting women
(30:02) down in the process of it then yes that makes you a pikman yeah but do you understand application like application
(30:09) so let's say we had of a grouping of definitions but then when we applied them in the real world that's not what
(30:14) we saw that's what's happening here hang on hang on hang on i just let you I didn't interrupt you once when this
(30:19) happens here's here's what I see happening i see when women go online and
(30:24) go "Here look at my busty bra and me pushing my boobies up and everything else there's tons of women underneath
(30:31) their uh account saying "You're a queen you go girl you rock you're epic etc
(30:37) etc." The only time I see them get called even though clearly that's male seeking they're seeking male validation
(30:43) clearly the only time I see them attack and call them a pickme is when they receive male validation because it's
(30:49) earned through like academia or something like this and they're actually saying things people agree with then it seems like when women actually attack
(30:56) them as Pikmis so women who are doing X or whatever they're doing I do not feel
(31:01) like they're seeking the validation of men i feel like they're doing what's best for them uh-huh yeah they're wearing a b They're wearing almost no
(31:07) clothes to impress women huh okay yeah and it pays their bills cuz they want male valid who's paying
(31:14) their bills women or men men they want male validation like what are you talking about validation has nothing to
(31:20) do with your money though like you can pay yes it does what are you talking about yes it does it does not it does
(31:27) not so if these w if all these men invalidated this woman would they be sending her money no that makes no sense
(31:33) i mean y'all don't validate her because she's not considered wife material is that correct that's not what we're First
(31:38) of all first of all validation if they're sending her money if they're sending her money they're validating her
(31:44) how how like there's no way around that i mean you cannot consider that validation she's profiting though so
(31:50) she's profiting the from men with wearing It's not their validation that pays her bills it's their money so
(31:58) okay can you explain can you just help me with this explain to me how it would be that a man would send you money and
(32:05) that wouldn't be him validating you or in some way affirming what it is that you're trying to do can you even ex
(32:11) begin to explain that concept to me yeah because you all don't validate those type of women you validate that doesn't
(32:17) give me who are not on X who are not only fans y'all validate those type of women those
(32:23) are the women who y'all respect of respect does not need your Why would
(32:31) a man send you a money to invalidate you that's the dumbest thing I've heard all
(32:36) day that's not dumb love so you're looking at validation differently validation we're picking what does
(32:41) validation mean what do you think it means can you pull up Can you pull up the definition of validation so everyone
(32:47) can see yeah pull up validation so everyone can see on the screen i already knew this was going to be a part of a
(32:54) conversation eli just back down please the act of confirming something is acceptable true or worthy accuracy the
(33:03) act listen it's the it's the act of confiring or proving the validity no
(33:08) that's that's only first definition there's multiple definitions validation is the acting or declaring something
(33:14) legally or officially acceptable no or the act of confirming that something is acceptable true or worthy so how would I
(33:21) not be saying your behavior is acceptable if I'm sending you money for your behavior that would make no sense that would be a contradiction but
(33:27) they're still not the same women he's right no no those are the same women by your by your metric they're the same
(33:32) women validating women though y'all don't Okay just just help me out here if I
(33:40) sent you money cuz I wanted you to take off your clothes how would that not be an act of confirming that that was
(33:47) acceptable how you all are viewing these different women differently so if you're
(33:52) viewing a woman on X who is doing what she does versus a woman who is more
(33:57) conservative you know you're not going to view them the same way and answer you're you're answering a question I
(34:03) didn't ask if a man sends a woman money to take off her clothes how would he not
(34:10) be engaged in an act of confirming that that is acceptable how what you're not
(34:16) understanding that man answer the question lady stop evading and just answer that woman is not seeking your
(34:22) validation that woman on X is not seeking your validation i'm going to try this again i'm going to try this again a
(34:29) man pays a woman to take her clothes off how is he not confirming that that's
(34:35) acceptable how okay so you can say it's acceptable because Okay thank you so
(34:40) that would be validation then okay so now that you've gotten the answer you wanted we're going to go back to the
(34:45) pick me woman and the woman who's on Xband who doesn't care about your opinion okay so if we're talking about
(34:51) these two women a pickme is someone who needs that validation from men that acceptance from men you won't accept
(34:58) that woman who's on X or Only Fans you'll Yeah except that they do if they're sending them money by your own
(35:03) metric and she is more conservative yes so so some men will validate women
(35:10) actually it's not having to do with you all it's having to do with that woman that's ins Okay this is crazy listen if
(35:16) even if it were the case that there's some women who receive validation from men cuz they keep their clothes on it's
(35:23) it's insane to say that women aren't receiving tons and tons of validation from men for taking their clothes off
(35:28) you saying that some men have a preference for this behavior over the preference for this behavior has no
(35:33) merit for why it is that we see women mostly attacking other women who are
(35:38) telling women to keep their clothes on as pickmies cuz that's what's actually happening and that's not for male
(35:45) validation that could be for all sorts of other reasons including the society that they live in so I I don't even
(35:50) understand the argument pick me cares about what a man thinks about her a woman on X does not that's the point I'm
(35:56) trying to make so does is any does any woman does any woman then any woman who
(36:01) cares what men think a pick me absolutely so So if if you're if you care any woman who care So if you care
(36:08) what your father thinks you're picking another woman down that's not what you just That's not what my question was my
(36:15) question was No and I'm elaborating on my answer so any woman that seeks
(36:20) validation or acceptance from a man and in the process puts down the next woman
(36:25) that's a qualifier i didn't That's not what I asked you i asked you if any woman wants validation from a man does
(36:32) that make her a pick me i'm not asking for qualifiers answer that question so any woman that wants wants validation
(36:38) from a man does that make her a pick me yes well then then if that's the case then every girl who wants validation
(36:45) from her father is a pickme an average man love your father's totally different
(36:50) oh now Oh wait i thought you just said that any woman who wants any validation from any man's a pick me a woman's
(36:56) father never needs his validation he had she had that from day one the average woman I would hope i'm speaking about
(37:02) the general man and the general almost every almost every human being on planet Earth wants their parents to be proud of
(37:09) them what are you talking about a man you need that acceptance and you need that validation from him and you're
(37:14) willing to put other women down to get that validation from that man then yes that makes her a pigment yeah all you're
(37:20) all you're doing is adding additional qualifiers to the insanity want to refer back to her father if you're having to
(37:27) step on your mother's toes and downplay your mother and get in your mother's way of your father because you want his
(37:33) validation so bad so damn right it makes you a pikmi i see so if a woman wants uh
(37:39) flowers from her man and that makes her feel really good right meaning he's
(37:45) engaged in the act of confirming something is acceptable in this case bringing her a flower she is a pickme by this definition you You understand that
(37:51) your man to do nice things for you you don't need his Yeah because you're a pickme by your definition because you want validation you want your man to do
(37:57) nice things for you you're a man now we're not talking about just an average man no just a guy you're dating just a
(38:03) guy you're dating just a guy you're dating no you want him to do nice things for you but that's not validation okay
(38:09) validation the act if and if validation the act of confirming something is acceptable a man that can't do something
(38:15) is give you flowers and why you with them like that's how is that not validation that's validation that's all
(38:21) validation okay that's what I'm saying the act of confirming something is acceptable true or worthy so if it is
(38:27) the case that the act of confirming something is acceptable it is acceptable to give a woman flowers therefore if you
(38:32) give a woman flowers you are acceptable that's acceptable so if that's the case it's validation yeah i don't think she
(38:38) knows what validation it still it still isn't still isn't validation definition on the screen love i know what it means
(38:43) and I'm highly educated i see you're you're so highly educated that a second ago you said any man who at any time you
(38:49) get validation from you're a Pikmin and I and I including your father that would be any man if you are stepping on
(38:55) another woman's toes to get that validation from a man then yes that makes you a pikmi that makes you a pikmi
(39:01) so so now the now the qualifier is if you're stepping on any other any other woman's toes yes because Pikmis are
(39:08) often classified as put other women down so if a woman wants to have if a woman
(39:13) wants to sleep with your man and you step in and stop that you by this definition now would now be a pickme
(39:18) because you're stepping on her toes to get validation from your man i would sure not be a pik me because she can have them but well so so so by your
(39:26) definition if a woman wanted to sleep with your man you wouldn't do anything to deter that because that would make
(39:32) you a pickme are you [ __ ] serious are you asking if I would stop a woman to sleep with my man that what you're
(39:37) asking sleeping with my man ma'am he's testing your logic and you're failing epically badly badly no no i
(39:44) really want to understand this question you're asking me if I would stop a woman from sleeping with my man no if I If you
(39:49) would if you if you had a woman who you knew wanted to sleep with your man We nisha would you encourage or discourage
(39:55) it that was a chick question cuz I just realized what pick me was today so because I seek a male's approval for
(40:02) whatever it is under the sun i'm a pick me and put down other women in the process
(40:08) i didn't say that yeah but she keeps on adding that qualifier just a qualifier
(40:13) yeah that's fine it's fine but I'm testing the qualifier is what I'm doing what I'm saying to you is that the qualifier here makes no sense i'll show
(40:19) you you guys are debating on the whole um the whole um word on what you you
(40:25) throw thank you how how completely useful for you to give us a recap of the debate we're currently in so anyway real quick real quick we were what we were
(40:33) doing hang on hang on you don't need clarity just listen for a second we're almost done we're literally almost done we're almost done all right so So here's
(40:40) the thing i just want to make sure that I got this correct if a woman you knew a woman wanted to sleep with your man i'm
(40:47) not asking you whether you would let it happen or not you just knew that she wanted to okay this is now a fulfillment
(40:53) of her desire to do so you barring that in any way shape or form or trying to
(40:58) prevent her from going around your man anything like this that would in fact make her a pickme by this logic correct
(41:04) no because my man already picked me we're talking about general have a man what so wait what so
(41:13) wait a second so so are you in a relationship so you can hang on hang on hang on hang on just real quick i'll tie
(41:20) it up with this i'll tie it up with this i'll tie it up i'll tie it up in a relationship with who you are not with
(41:25) if you are trying to get their validation and they don't owe you anything and you are putting down another woman to seek the validation
(41:31) from them then yes that is a pickme so let me get this right then so you can step on the toes of another woman if it
(41:39) is the case that you were picked wouldn't that make all women pickmies then no well then I don't understand why
(41:46) why would it be okay to do as long as you were already picked pick me understanding the logic of a pick i don't understand the logic you're right
(41:52) about that you're not i could never be a pick me when it comes to my man so when you first started dating your your man I
(42:00) don't know if you're married or not to him so I'll just say your man so you're telling me that when you first started dating him you weren't dressing a
(42:06) certain way or looking a certain way when you were around him to seek his validation in order for him to uh become
(42:13) attracted to you or like you or pursue you further i never changed how I dress to get that
(42:22) man she's a liar so in order for him to pick me differently than other women it's
(42:29) cool you're pick me by your own logic i don't care i mean I don't care what you think I am love i mean no I'm just
(42:34) saying by your logic you are i'm not calling you that i'm just saying by your logic you would be that if it is the
(42:39) case if it is the case no if it is the case understanding the definition I'm using your definition your definition is
(42:46) as follows i'll give you the definition hang on hang on let me say the definition you could tell me yes or no
(42:53) applied for gender and not yours if I have a boyfriend or let me restate just
(42:59) for clarity with me when it comes to him calm down for one second i'm calm let me
(43:05) state your definition you can tell me if it's wrong or correct then we won't be speaking past each other your definition
(43:10) of a pickme is a woman who wants validation from a man even if it's at the if it's at the expense of a woman
(43:18) yes okay so I'm not wrong about your def Hang on stop stop stop stop real quick and I don't We don't need a 100,000 more
(43:26) words i just want to get clarification you've given a million you've given a million i just want clarification just
(43:31) want clarification if you are a pick me that means you are seeking the validation for general men not your man
(43:39) why would you need to be a pick me for your man you've already Yeah I I understand what I'm saying is that
(43:44) here's your logic then i'm going to give you your logical entailment if it is the case that you're a pickme if you're willing to step on the feet of a of a
(43:52) woman in order to uh get validation from a man and then you say "But that's perfectly acceptable." Yeah I understand
(43:59) but if you say it's perfectly acceptable to do that when you have a man because you've already been picked then that
(44:06) stop lady stop just let me finish let me finish i am finished please i'm almost done if it is the case then that it's
(44:13) perfectly acceptable for you to be a pickme for your man then all women are
(44:19) [ __ ] pickmies by this definition all of them would have to be no that's not the case man have already picked her to
(44:26) be his lady yeah so she's a pick me if you're in a relationship yeah so she's a pick me cuz she got picked in a
(44:32) relationship being a pick me means you're seeking the validation i have everything I need from my man yeah I know but you're still seeking validation
(44:38) from your man you just think that's fine smash my man would not be pick me behavior because he's my man if it was a
(44:44) random man if it was a man that was not my man and I'm stepping on that woman's toes then yes that would be What did you
(44:50) do what did you do prior to him being your man or what did women do prior to their man get validation from him thank
(44:57) you i He picked me i didn't pick him so you still Bro you didn't want any
(45:02) validation let me just say something wait wait wait wait let me just real quick yo but I wasn't seeking his validation i was not seeking his Sure
(45:09) you weren't yeah you wanted everybody to have validation from him but you okay baby i am the
(45:16) I've never needed to change anything I did to get him in i want to say something let me say something you guys
(45:22) I appreciate you letting me on the panel you have a wonderful night hold on hold on i I do want to hear you some more but hold on the thing is this this is this
(45:29) is what's worthless stupid troll uh good evening thanks for having me up i appreciate it
(45:35) good evening for the uh for the Tik Tok purposes my uh I'm 41 years old
(45:43) much appreciated yeah no problem so I wanted to very quickly piggyback off what that guy was saying um so this is
(45:50) going to be inside the executive order you can find it yourself or I can link
(45:56) it to you perhaps it's in um section two under B uh B subsection A um of this
(46:04) section shall apply only to persons who are born within the United States after 30 days from the date of this order so
(46:09) he was actually right it will not so it does not retroactively apply the executive order only applies forward by
(46:16) the executive order again B subsection A of the se section shall apply only to persons who are born within the United
(46:22) States after 30 days from the date of the order he was correct okay and
(46:27) and what would him stop what would stop him from changing it later well I mean
(46:35) what's to stop anybody from doing anything i'm just pointing out that the executive order itself is as he stated
(46:41) would not apply retroactively it can't actually apply retroactively via the executive Hang on that was what was in
(46:47) dispute he was correct i just want to see if he'll acknowledge he was correct no what the the original conversation
(46:53) was about him attacking people with birthright citizenship yeah but I mean but initial conversation yeah but what
(47:00) you did do was you said "No this is a claim you haven't made the claim." And you said it's not factual that he can't
(47:06) revoke citizenship and it it is in factual via the executive order which is exactly what he said and and and what
(47:13) has kept him from revoking citizenship from people who already had United States citizens the executive order
(47:20) itself in the section B subsection A proven false no I literally I'm going to
(47:25) prove it to you right now he's already deported people with United States citizenship
(47:30) who is he report deported with United States citizenship unless it's an accident like you do realize accidents
(47:36) will happen like even under Joe Biden I'm sure there was people who were deported it's pretty ridiculous when
(47:41) when you say that oh he's only going to attack people with uh birthright citizenship after 30 days um but not
(47:49) actually like take into consequence that he's already deporting people with birthright wait wait wait wait no no no
(47:56) that's not the claim that's and that this wasn't the claim that was being made you really are throwing out a red herring here the claim you made was that
(48:02) this does retroactively apply it does not retroactively apply to revoke
(48:08) citizenship which is exactly what that gentleman told you and I have it right here you can find this from the White
(48:14) House .gov itself this is protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship executive order and you can
(48:21) find this heading and and no a red herring is what he did the original
(48:26) conversation was he's attacking people with birthright citizenship okay if you can cons if you can make a single
(48:32) concession here I'll move the conversation there where you and it doesn't even hurt your position to just say "Hey look I was incorrect." So So so
(48:39) it says it here no I I read it here but again he's attacking people with US
(48:46) citizenship okay but can can we just make a simple concession to move the conversation forward that he indeed is
(48:51) not does not have the executive order did I not just do that okay well then fair enough right so we agree the
(48:57) executive order does not retroactively go after people now when it comes to the amendment itself you would agree the constitution is a living document which
(49:04) is up to interpretation correct uh not by the president well uh I think
(49:12) yes by by all branch of government and unless challenged right you can challenge these things in the courts not
(49:18) not by the president well never been that the president's not an interpreter
(49:24) not not ever okay well then how does the president know what laws he can do or not do he can't make laws no no no which
(49:33) law well he can enforce all laws he's the chief law enforcement agent no no that that's that's also false no that's
(49:39) definitely not false look it up yourself if you think I'm wrong he's in charge of enforcing the laws of the United States
(49:45) sir the three branches of government uh the executive the judicial so can you tell me who who
(49:53) which one of Hang on hang on real quick which one of those which one of those out of the ones I just Hang on out of
(49:58) the the executive branch enforces the laws of the United States which branch does the president fall under he's the
(50:05) executive right and the executive enforces the
(50:10) laws of the United States okay so again do you agree that the
(50:17) executive enforces the laws of the United States does the president have executive action in actually holding
(50:24) upholding the law yes no yes he does he can he has an attorney
(50:31) general he puts in place he literally can enforce the law yes it's Yes so so
(50:37) so not the president the president himself can sign executive orders enforcing law yes you just conceded that
(50:44) it's the attorney general no the president himself is the commander-in-chief of the United States armed forces what are you talking about
(50:51) the president So if the president decides to write an unconstitutional executive order that gives him the right
(50:57) to do so yeah you could so so here because he can enforce the law okay listen by the way there is precedent for
(51:04) this but yeah but hang I'm trying to answer your question dude you can't shotgun him otherwise it's not fair for either of us so let me answer the
(51:10) question the executives or job is actually yes to enforce the laws of the
(51:16) United States it's a primary job in fact primary so the thing is is like yes he
(51:21) is in charge of the FBI he's in charge of the intelligencia agencies he's in charge of all of this and he's also in
(51:27) charge of the United States military hang on hang on hang on hang on hang on wait a second the Supreme Court their
(51:34) job is to interpret the Constitution and and see if laws fit the Constitution to
(51:40) determine if they're constitutional or not constitutional so so okay so but per the Constitution
(51:46) Article 2 Section 3 the Constitution provides that the president shall take care that laws are being faithfully
(51:53) faithfully executed that does not mean he himself is I'll just give you an easy
(52:00) summary just you can just ask this question into Google yourself yes the executive branch of the United States government enforces laws the executive
(52:07) branch includes the president vice president cabinet other agencies the president signs legislation into law
(52:14) vetos bills arguing against the constitution bro bro not this is not this is not me okay well then what what
(52:20) what is the president's job then dude what do you think his job is to faithfully take care that the laws are
(52:26) being executed oh so his job is to execute the laws like I just said shall
(52:32) take shall No that's not what you said yes it is president No it's not the president shall take care that the laws
(52:39) uh be faithfully executed yes so they're enforced correctly the
(52:44) laws are enforced correctly the duty potentially at least five categories of executive power powers of the
(52:51) constitution confers directly on the president by opening and and uh succeeding clauses article two yes
(52:57) powers of Congress those are those are all the powers that allow him to enforce the laws of the land sir
(53:03) you're you're not listening you know tell me how I'm wrong you're You're not listening so which branch do you think
(53:09) is is in charge of executing the laws of the United States and and is in charge of the ultimate enforcement arm since
(53:15) they're in charge of the United States military sir you're not listening i'm listen dude I'm listening not only
(53:22) am I I'm giving you a counterargument you've you've pivoted to what from the beginning to what i told you that the
(53:28) president's job is to enforce law i told you that the original argument was that the that Trump's executive order is
(53:35) attacking people yeah but then you said that the president doesn't enforce and is not the executor of law and then you
(53:41) were completely wrong about that can you just concede on that no I wasn't okay well then who then whose job is it in
(53:47) the government so who who actually enforces the law is it the president or is it judges
(53:53) uh as far as enforcement goes is is that why we have three branches of government
(53:58) or not yeah well okay the the judicial branch what they're doing is they're the executive branch hang on yes is to
(54:06) enforce the law yes it's to enforce the law yes but the judicial branch is also
(54:11) is also a check yes i agree i totally agree with that so So now we're making some progress i totally agree that
(54:16) they're a check to that but the president's also a check to the judicial branch the the judiciary does not have
(54:23) universal unilateral control over the laws of the United States the president definitely can be an inter they don't
(54:30) they don't no then what then who checks them if it's checks and balances then
(54:35) who checks the judiciary who's checking them you just said that the Supreme Court interprets the laws so if you're
(54:41) telling me that the president executes an a unconstitutional law that the Supreme Court has no right to overturn
(54:48) that no I'm not saying that at all i'm explaining No no I'm not i'm explaining to you that there's a Listen I'm telling
(54:55) you right now there's a check for the Supreme Court right who's that
(55:01) no one no one's a check so the sup No one's a check for the Supreme Court so the Supreme Court is the unilateral uh
(55:08) governing body of the United States then is that right in interpreting the law no that's not what you said who checks the
(55:15) Supreme Court who checks them if a law if a law is challenged by this and it
(55:20) goes to the Supreme Court and the Supreme Court deems it unconstitutional who who's above the Supreme Court so if
(55:26) the Supreme Court says that we can sacrifice human children that's the law so So So when when was that said no
(55:33) that's my question no can somebody challenge that to somebody else other than the Supreme Court so again answer
(55:40) the question what if the Supreme Court deems a law unconstitutional who's above
(55:46) the Supreme Court yeah so there could be checks and balances to this that's that you didn't answer yeah yes so the Yes
(55:52) the executive can disagree listen the executive I'm I'm answering it you have to stop talking though bro you didn't
(55:58) i'm Do you want me to or not you if you actually can yeah yes the president can
(56:05) definitely disagree with the Supreme Court's decisions and has would you like me to give you multiple examples in
(56:10) history where this has happened i I I would want I want Okay so the Supreme
(56:16) Court they there Let me pull I'll pull up the exact case actually if you just give me two seconds so that I can pull
(56:22) it
(56:29) up just hang tight i'll pull it up
(56:38) okay so Andrew Jackson was one such who ignored the Supreme Court and uh he
(56:45) ignored the court hang on would you would you stop bro so that I can at least cite it for you did he do that
(56:50) lawfully yes he did it lawfully yes answer that he ignored the courts he
(56:57) ignored the court's rulings he did what he want dude how can I answer you if you keep muting me or you interrupt me when
(57:03) I'm answering the question because you're bringing up [ __ ] arguments what's the [ __ ] of the argument he
(57:10) broke the law didn't he no no i In fact he did not break the law says who yes he
(57:16) did says who you ignoring Uhhuh ruling by the Supreme
(57:22) Court uh-huh what if they make an unjust law dude
(57:27) how do you challenge an unjust law by the Supreme Court dude how you have to challenge it again from the same court
(57:34) who made it to begin with that's the way our [ __ ] What the [ __ ] are you talking about what you don't honestly believe
(57:41) that do you you don't really believe that do you why why aren't you answering the
(57:48) question okay so So what yes yeah hang on yes yes the Supreme Court can be
(57:53) checked by the other branches of government yes so which which so which which order did uh Andrew Jackson the
(58:00) the genocider uh refuse to listen to yeah I just I just started to read it to
(58:06) you would you like for me to tell you again well continue yeah so there was an order which was handed down about what he could do with the Cherokee and he
(58:12) completely ignored it and did what he wanted unlawfully
(58:18) okay what made it unlawful the genocide
(58:24) no wait what what are you talking about so then if the Supreme Court So then
(58:30) answer me this if that's the case if the Supreme Court Hang on hang on bro listen if the Supreme Court rule dude what was
(58:38) the actual Supreme Court why won't you [ __ ] Why Why can't I ask you a single question if it is the case that the
(58:44) Supreme Court rules Dude Dude hang on real quick if the Supreme Court I just
(58:49) read it to you dude no no you didn't supreme Court decision okay hang on and
(58:54) I'll pull it back up even though I literally just read it to you and you just didn't listen no no you you No you
(59:00) you you blathered on about what the decision was yes you mean I was reading
(59:06) you the decision no no you didn't actually read the case what was the case
(59:12) uh the case was um Warchester vers Georgia 1832
(59:21) it established that the Cherokee Nation was independent and then Jackson went ahead and did the whole Trail of Cheers thing
(59:27) so it was unlawful no what made it unlawful
(59:33) supreme Court said that the Cherokee Nation was an independent nation and he
(59:39) violated it that was unlawful yeah what makes that unlawful
(59:45) the violation of the Supreme Court order what made it lawful so if the Supreme Court then had decided that it was okay
(59:53) to use the G-word against all of the natives you would consider that to be lawful and the president to not be
(59:59) lawful if Stop just let me answer ask the question please i just answered your question please answer my question if
(1:00:07) the Supreme Court if this had gone in reverse and the president ignored the Supreme Court if they told him not to do
(1:00:12) a Jside would you then say or if they told him to do the Jside would you then say the Supreme Court was acting
(1:00:18) lawfully is that what happened now can you answer my question is that what happened can you answer my question no I
(1:00:25) don't do hypotheticals so how do I test your logic
(1:00:31) with actual case law what are you t dude okay if if you can't argue in reality
(1:00:38) then what are you doing here i'm telling you over and over again that yes the
(1:00:44) Supreme Court's rulings change because you have interpreters of law and also
(1:00:50) that they are not the final word or final arbiter they have checks against them as well which includes ignoring
(1:00:57) their laws and ignoring their interpretations that would be a check yeah which is unlawful
(1:01:04) so they can't make So the Supreme Court can make no unlawful law they can interpret no law unlawfully
(1:01:10) what did I when when did I say that
(1:01:15) so I don't understand well I don't understand so the Supreme Court is the ultimate ruling of the land
(1:01:21) that's literally their position so is that your position so Andrew Jackson's refusal to enforce the Supreme Court
(1:01:28) decision Warchester versus was unlawful because the United States Constitution
(1:01:33) the executive branch is required to uphold the rulings of the judicial branch the Constitution is the princip
(1:01:40) yeah you ready to get destroyed you ready to get destroyed now two if two
(1:01:45) the uh if twothirds of Congress says no it's over right yeah yeah so you're not
(1:01:51) listening if twothirds of Congress over Dude listen to what I'm saying you two of Congress oh my god this guy dude
(1:01:58) listen to what I'm saying so So twothirds of Congress didn't override that Supreme Court ruling yeah but you
(1:02:04) said they couldn't so you're wrong uh yeah the executive branch is required to uphold the rulings of the judicial
(1:02:09) branch the Constitution establishes the principle of separation executive legislative and judicial
(1:02:16) branches are supposed to operate independently and each branch respecting the authority of the other [ __ ] cases
(1:02:23) of Andrew Jackson committing a [ __ ] G-side against the Supreme Court's
(1:02:28) decision that is unlawful this [ __ ] guy I like holy
(1:02:37) [ __ ] i love I love the unbelievable
(1:02:42) [ __ ] Nazi supporters and that hate the fact that they can't
(1:02:49) violate the Constitution like the fact that you think you can't
(1:02:54) violate that you can violate the Constitution because it hurts your feelings is laughable your tears give me
(1:03:03) power uh uh what's going on man hey what's going
(1:03:09) on so just real quick we can clarify i'm going to let you speak you're going to let me speak but no [ __ ] mute button
(1:03:16) that's fair right yep okay yep yep yep and um happy Good Friday by the way i heard you're a man of God as well so
(1:03:22) happy Good Friday are you yeah yeah i'm a Christian well can I say happy Easter
(1:03:29) to you man i'm um I I sure hope you have a great one absolutely all right so
(1:03:34) rules are I'm going to try and defend the position that Trump is bad at foreign policy no mute button um you
(1:03:40) know let you speak the whole time and yeah we can um I'm actually excited cuz I was only debating for a month when you
(1:03:46) uh mopped the floors with me with Russian Ukraine so we're going to we can do a little bit better this time so yeah with that being said right um so I'll
(1:03:52) just go ahead and give my position and then I'll hear how we go back forth and things like this um I think Donald Trump
(1:03:58) is bad at is is just has terrible foreign policy for a plethora of reasons
(1:04:03) number one the unnecess the threat or the actioning of unnecessary um
(1:04:09) invasions and things to put us bad on the world stage like Panama Canal uh Greenland um Canada um dealing with Iran
(1:04:17) when he backed us out of the nuclear deal and this whole weird idea to go turn Palestine into the river of the
(1:04:24) Middle East because that quite literally one is a bad capital investment on us and it gives China a reason to try and
(1:04:30) take up our our global trade in the Middle and not much going on with Russia and
(1:04:36) Ukraine and uh with that being said um yeah that's my position and yeah you can
(1:04:41) feel free well let me make a couple of concessions at the outset of this of course concession one is that you are
(1:04:47) correct on the Palestinian rhetoric the idea that he's going to move American bases into Palestine in order for them
(1:04:53) to displace every Palestinian and move them into refugee camps is insane however is that a bargaining chip that's
(1:05:01) um you know that I I don't know i don't know i think it could just be a bargaining chip but his relationship
(1:05:06) with Israel is very tight-knit there's no doubt that that's true i do think that Greenland has uh significant
(1:05:13) strategic importance and if we can buy if we can buy out Greenland I don't see that as being a problem i think it would
(1:05:19) be good for Greenland i don't see why that's bad foreign policy uh or the Panama Canal i'll also say his foreign
(1:05:25) policy I think on tariffs is very good though it does appear that it's a bit topsyturvy at the moment i don't have
(1:05:30) any problem with his foreign policy on tariffs either so I think that that there are is maybe some ground we can
(1:05:37) meet in here where I can say some of the Trump foreign policy doesn't seem to be
(1:05:42) great but other portions of his foreign policy does seem to be quite good let me so let's just meet in the middle where
(1:05:48) we so do you agree so I take a stance that Greenland is unnecessary and is a
(1:05:53) net negative do you do you share the opposite um viewpoint on Greenland a net negative how for the purpose of
(1:06:00) strategic for for the purpose of strategy no for the purpose of like maybe GDP or something like that maybe
(1:06:07) at least at first but from from a strategic standpoint absolutely not greenland is uh strategically very
(1:06:14) important to the United States absolutely so so what I meant by that is like the act of going through and the
(1:06:21) evidence that I would like to um use for at least Greenland's opinion is the actual president saying that you know
(1:06:27) speaking on behalf of his people that we all want to remain Greenlanders and the population of Greenland which isn't
(1:06:32) really that high there's been a few surveys saying that even all the people there actually want to remain you know sovereign because I believe they do
(1:06:38) still belong to I believe Denmark yeah belong to Denmark number one number two um the US um so buying it might be off
(1:06:46) the table based on that evidence and I haven't seen any traction on it i know there's been some prior deals in the past but if we try and take military
(1:06:52) action quoting from Trump's exact quotes right trump said that when it came to
(1:06:58) Panama and Greenland using military force may be now keep in mind this isn't a concession from him right but I'm just
(1:07:04) quoting him may be something that we have to do so using the fact that we've had you know some failed things on the
(1:07:11) monetary side of the house if the only way to take it militarily I do believe that alienates us from places like NATO
(1:07:17) and creates enemies in the EU because they have NATO bases there and and they do do trade with EU and I do think that
(1:07:23) getting into conflicts um with Europe when a lot of them are our allies is a
(1:07:28) net negative to foreign policy pos I I disagree and agree so I agree
(1:07:35) with you that an invasion of Greenland like a a mainland invasion from United
(1:07:40) States forces would be highly problematic but I think that a president has a responsibility to also uh say
(1:07:48) essentially for most cases that uh the military is not off the table i think
(1:07:54) that presidents historically have always stated no of course the military is not off the table and the reason they do
(1:08:00) that and it actually makes sense it would actually you would have way more egg on your face down the road if there
(1:08:06) was military intervention for some justifiable reason now I don't know what the justifiable reason here would be
(1:08:12) like I don't know maybe there's a cell of al-Qaeda inside of Greenland or something and we had to send in American
(1:08:18) forces and then they're like "Well you said that that was off the table." You know what I mean so I I think that it's
(1:08:24) fine for him to say military force is never off the table basically for basically any country i mean uh for
(1:08:30) Mexico it's not off the table for Canada it's not off the table or defense department has plans for invasion for
(1:08:35) both of those nations not kidding so the thing is is like uh no I don't I don't think that there's anything problematic
(1:08:42) with with saying that i just think it would be problematic if he actually did invade absolutely but I'm just saying
(1:08:47) though if Trump actually wants this done right using deductive reasoning right we've seen at least two times in the
(1:08:53) past where they've tried to at least make an attempt to lodge out saying "Hey can we buy Greenland?" So so I'm just
(1:09:00) want to hear like I believe on the facts using deductive reasoning tried already to buy it if Trump actually wants his
(1:09:06) vision to be done then I would have to use deductive reasoning to say that the only other option is to take it through
(1:09:11) military force they don't want any mod well your deduction is incorrect i mean you can do tariffs you could do economic
(1:09:17) sanctions you could do blockades you could you could hurt Greenland any number of ways to bring them to the
(1:09:23) negotiating table absent military force which would be even more useful so
(1:09:28) you're kind of in a false dichotomy here the dichotomy is it's either military or they have to agree but not only is that
(1:09:35) a false dichotomy it doesn't even make sense you can use a hundred different types of ways in order to uh force
(1:09:41) Greenland's hand where they think it would be better to become a part you know the 51st state or something like
(1:09:46) this so with that being said with Greenland is there any evidence that Trump is exercising cuz the cuz the only
(1:09:53) things that I'm seeing is one you know we do see the track record of the attempted monetary buy and two at least
(1:09:58) the rhetoric he's trying to you know he would entertain using the military is there any track record of him using
(1:10:04) those other techniques that you referenced yeah of go yeah yeah through tariffs he's done yeah i mean tariffs
(1:10:09) have been remarkably effective at getting people to the negotiating table and I can give you many such cases of
(1:10:15) his tariffs bringing people to the negotiating table uh in this case this would include everybody from China to
(1:10:21) Israel i mean Netanyahu came out specifically to have a special meeting with Trump based on the tariffs that he
(1:10:27) was going to put against Israel brought brought them right to the negotiating table something with Greenland could be
(1:10:32) similar with economic sanctions of course however do I think that Greenland's going to become the 51st
(1:10:38) state perhaps not but it does seem like um from a strategic perspective it's not
(1:10:45) the the worst idea to entertain that we could you know kind of incorporate
(1:10:50) Greenland as a 51st state now I don't want them cuz they're a bunch of [ __ ] leftists okay i don't want Greenland
(1:10:56) okay i don't want them but I understand the strategic importance of of Greenland
(1:11:01) to the United States it is very strategically important okay so can we move to Panama and then back and then
(1:11:07) and then back to the place where you mocked me originally in Europe can we just go yeah yeah yeah yeah sure we can move we can move but but hang on maybe
(1:11:14) we can we end this with this uh maybe we can end this with some agreement if Greenland offered itself for sale you
(1:11:21) agree with me we should buy it okay so with the provisions that the that you know their NATO military bases and
(1:11:27) things wouldn't like destroy our relationship with people in Europe then yes who would it destroy relations with
(1:11:33) don't they have NATO bases in Greenland so yeah but I mean we have a space base in Greenland so what okay okay okay then
(1:11:40) the answer would be So the answer would be yes so yes so then so then you're not exactly opposed to Trump buying
(1:11:46) Greenland if Greenland went up for sale so I don't even think we have a huge disagreement here on foreign policy on
(1:11:51) this on this particular uh on this particular issue so what's the next one panama Canal right so my big thing about
(1:11:59) this is um one I believe this is relatively useless for three different things right trump Trump created uh
(1:12:05) number one Trump created the rhetoric that um you know China was taking over the canal and things like that we don't
(1:12:12) have evidence of that in fact we have evidence of them just asking them to go do an infrastructure project that ends
(1:12:17) like really soon I believe this summer number one uh number two they were actually charging us unreasonable rates
(1:12:23) according to the 1999 agreement in fact according to the ITA and according to the PCP the average for all the
(1:12:29) countries was about 25 uh 26.6 we were getting charged 25.6 million uh USD
(1:12:36) which means we were getting a slight discount and um then the uh third one um actually no I think it's just those two
(1:12:43) they violated the agreement and they make the claim that China is taking over the canal and I don't think that's just
(1:12:48) to post any reason to uh take it over considering they've been fair to us yeah
(1:12:53) so um so let's kind of dissect a few of these claims and maybe maybe we can have
(1:13:00) some agreement here too though I think we mostly would disagree so in the beginning of Trump's tariff policy
(1:13:06) people were pretty upset with the fact that he was putting such large tariffs on Canada for instance uh it didn't seem
(1:13:12) to make a lot of sense but when you do dove into it it actually made a lot of sense so if you have a trade war with
(1:13:18) China and the whole idea is to [ __ ] the Chinese economy but China has a backdoor to another economy who has a
(1:13:24) free trade agreement with them in this case Canada so let's say the Chinese set up thousands of proxy companies inside
(1:13:30) of Canada via a free trade agreement with them send their goods to Canada and then Canada has a free trade agreement
(1:13:36) with us they use a backdoor to enter into our economy and skip the tariffs
(1:13:41) you agree that that's the case right you're you're saying that they're going to use the panel um that is likely I wouldn't say that's
(1:13:48) I wouldn't operate in an absolute because the way that I would defend that position is that using the same tariffs
(1:13:54) or like whenever other people use tariffs the financial trend is that other countries can just use other
(1:14:00) countries supply chains not necessarily something like the Panama Canal so um to
(1:14:05) want to stop that right that would be the point well yeah but to say that they would want and if I so I wouldn't
(1:14:12) operate absolutes here saying that the only option would be the pan Well it's not the only option I'm give what I'm
(1:14:17) giving is good justification so here if Canada and we do know for sure that the
(1:14:22) Chinese have bought up tons of Canadian real estate and companies uh just like they have American real estate and
(1:14:28) companies there's no doubt that this is the case same thing with Mexico they can avoid tariffs with the United States by
(1:14:34) using our neighbors who we would have a North American free trade agreement with that would be really really bad right so
(1:14:40) if we had free trade with Canada the Chinese sent their product to Canada to avoid the tariffs because Canada had a
(1:14:46) unilateral agreement with them that would actually hurt us and curtail our effort to [ __ ] that economy the same
(1:14:52) exact thing would be true with the Panama Canal the the same exact idea here is in effect that the Chinese can
(1:14:58) use this in order to move their product tariff-free uh through a backdoor to our
(1:15:03) economy and so we would want to get control of that that's what the point is right so I see your point there and then
(1:15:09) going back to like a similar argument I would use on my Greenland argument is that the you know once again the costbenefit analysis of like cuz you do
(1:15:16) agree that we're not the only ones that use the canal right yeah but we could we could we could also we we could put fat
(1:15:22) taxes on that canal if we had control of it right okay but but be before we get to that point and the the answer to your
(1:15:28) question is yes but getting there is the part I'm talking about right i have various quotes from from from the EU and
(1:15:34) from China that that's saying that they would potentially you know because they do rent out ports in Cologne or city
(1:15:42) sure do yeah so yeah well I mean that Yeah that's that's what we do as well part of the deal right so they Yeah but
(1:15:48) we but we want to right we want to see ourselves be the ones who who get that not China that's the point okay go ahead
(1:15:54) i'm sorry i know but I'm making an argument for an intermediate point here that I think we're both Well I think we're both have to dissect here right
(1:16:00) okay so EU so EU countries and China I've got quotes from both saying that they would take military action if you
(1:16:07) know cuz they they want to defend what's going on there if um they and if we do
(1:16:12) any sort of military action in Panama number one that would technically we would be violating technically our 1999
(1:16:18) agreement because we couldn't paint the picture that they violated any of the terms right not charging us over more
(1:16:24) than other countries like other things so how do we overcome that because before you get to the ideal scenario you
(1:16:31) would have to justify potentially getting into a military conflict with the EU countries that that use the canal
(1:16:36) and China that uses the canal first yeah again you're making a fundamental
(1:16:41) dichotomy mistake again where it's an either or it's a bifurcation it's like either we militarily take it over or we
(1:16:48) can't take it over that's just not the case the case is is that the United States can apply political pressure and
(1:16:54) tariffs again against this region in order to incentivize them to give us
(1:17:01) control of that canal even if it stays in the country's hand but we have basic unilateral control we have deals like
(1:17:07) this all over the place a good example of this would be the Japanese defense force we have control of the Japanese
(1:17:14) military even though they're a sovereign nation we have complete control over their military they're only allowed to
(1:17:19) have a defensive force even to this day the exchange there is that we provide security something like that with the
(1:17:25) Panama Canal would work fine um and has worked in the past by the way so the the
(1:17:31) question here just becomes is it of great enough strategic importance to use leverage so that our trade adversaries
(1:17:38) don't have access as a back door i think it is i think you can make a good compelling case that if that's in our
(1:17:44) hands we can not only upcharge in taxes but it would be a really good idea for
(1:17:49) us to not allow that to be a back door uh into our economy so do you have any
(1:17:55) evidence that Trump is you know so we know that he's been dropping tariffs you know all over the world you know not not
(1:18:01) going to deny that right but the only evidence that I have about him actioning one is sending one I'm going to use the
(1:18:06) evidence of uh Marco Rubio February 5th right i mean it's one thing to say that
(1:18:11) Trump could potentially do this like with terrorists but they actually he he actually asked the president if the US
(1:18:18) could you know start having operations February 5th 2020 um didn't go so well on his end he kind of left he had signs
(1:18:23) made out of him and stuff has Trump tried to action tariffs to quite literally um you know at least have
(1:18:29) administrative control of the canal has he at least well not yet but I mean he's he's just over 100 days into uh his
(1:18:36) second term and I think that you know if you're going to see actions like this it's going to be probably the middle of
(1:18:41) his administration right now he's been only fighting specifically to put these
(1:18:47) massive and if you look at his uh program for tariffs it seems to be hyperfixated on China itself and trying
(1:18:54) to close back doors into the American economy from Chinese interest literally his entire trade war seems to be focused
(1:19:01) on uh destroying China's economy uh by any means necessary which by the way is
(1:19:08) probably the best [ __ ] idea a president has had in 100 years honestly it's a good idea to do it so I mean you
(1:19:15) agree with that right like you agree that the Chinese that us uh crippling in
(1:19:21) any way we can their kind of economic power against the United States is definitely in our best interest and
(1:19:27) right now we can whereas in 30 years we may not be able to so um we'll get to
(1:19:34) terrorists last i hold a contrarian view i think it's doing more damage than potential long-term benefit but I do
(1:19:39) want to make my way to the Middle East then to back to the same uh freaking Ukraine I got um I got destroyed in and
(1:19:45) then we can talk about terrorists cuz I do want to have that conversation all right so you said that that I think we
(1:19:50) both disagree on I mean I think we both agree that Gaza is probably not the best idea is that what I said is that what we
(1:19:56) said in the beginning yeah i don't support uh this action at all the idea
(1:20:02) it fits so I'm not sure that it would fit my proprietary definition of the
(1:20:08) Gword right i'm not going to you know using Tik Tok friendly words but it definitely would fit a broader UN
(1:20:14) definition of the G-word to remove millions of people from their stated
(1:20:20) land right now that they're in off into a refugee camps hundreds and hundreds of
(1:20:26) miles away uh that that would definitely fit the the definition of that from from
(1:20:32) you know from my perspective and from the UN perspective yeah I was about to say that that's the
(1:20:38) UN definition that I use is um displacement whole or in part of like ethnic group all right well we can move
(1:20:43) it on to Iran now this is something that Okay so Iran right um as you do know uh
(1:20:50) 2015 we were part of the ACPOA um the nuclear proliferation deal with Iran especially in NXF where it said
(1:20:58) that um they were only allowed to um house about 3% annually of pluton of
(1:21:03) plutonium grade uranium and I thought it was a good deal to keep us a part of and then Trump backs us out in 2018 and now
(1:21:12) now in 2025 you know Iran's all beating their chest right now about how they have enough nuclear material and I just
(1:21:18) don't think there's justification for Trump to back us out of that deal um especially when it had sanctions and
(1:21:25) leverages and controls and evidence that they were at least staying in line from 2015 to 2018 when he backed us out so do
(1:21:32) you think that was a good idea that Trump backed us out of the ACPOA probably and here's why have you ever
(1:21:37) heard of the virus stukes no I haven't so the Stukesnet virus was
(1:21:43) a virus which was um basically co-made by the American Intelligence Agency and
(1:21:51) MSAD in Israel and what they did was they deployed it against Iran inside of
(1:21:57) the nuclear facilities and what it did was it slowly increased the speed of the
(1:22:03) centrifuges until they destroyed themselves until they ripped apart that's what the entire goal of the
(1:22:09) Stukeset virus was this was stolen uh so
(1:22:14) so how this thing was made is interesting how it was actually stolen
(1:22:20) from uh uh Microsoft itself they had the source code for Windows which they were
(1:22:25) not giving out somehow Israel got its hands on the source code or the United
(1:22:30) States did one or the other and it was at least shared yeah you can look it up stokeset is what the virus is called and
(1:22:36) they deployed it uh via espionage in Iran increasing the centuge speed slowly
(1:22:43) and it would just rip their reactors to shreds that's what it did and what happened as a response to that is Iran
(1:22:49) created one of the largest uh counteroffensive hacker systems in the
(1:22:56) world uh many people have even said that uh modern-day anonymous is backed mostly
(1:23:02) by Iranian hackers right trump here is dealt a bit of a bad hand right the
(1:23:09) Iranians don't trust anybody when it comes to their nuclear program whatsoever uh and probably with you know
(1:23:16) good reason right they probably have good reason trump seems to only be left
(1:23:22) with this idea now of the potentiality of force because of the Greater Israel
(1:23:28) project or uh coming up with some type of new negotiation which would stop
(1:23:34) proliferation uh but Stukesnet is done and I'm not sure what other cards he has
(1:23:39) to play staying a part of this agreement is not going to stop a nuclear armed Iran and they've made that very clear
(1:23:45) sorry were you done okay um so my my only contention with
(1:23:50) this right cuz at least I I know now and and at least from you and Dr galassi whose reference that I used to see how
(1:23:57) much material were they stockpiling afterwards right from 2019 on it was anywhere from 20x to 60x though so with
(1:24:05) that being said though there were sanctions for the nuclear material i understand your claim with stuckset if I'm pronouncing that right yeah and
(1:24:12) whichever way you want to put it yeah it's fine yeah sorry i'm a country boy from Maryland but with that being said
(1:24:19) um was did Trump have the opportunity to go pass a subsequent deal because I believe still having some sort of
(1:24:25) administrative action because it was a good deal too because also the UN was able to investigate their um their
(1:24:30) nuclear facilities to make sure they weren't you know um stockpiling nuclear material so well the whole idea here for
(1:24:39) proliferation is Iran is making the claim that they want nuclear energy they
(1:24:46) want a nuclear power plant in order to create energy an energyindependent Iran
(1:24:52) now on paper actually that's totally reasonable i wish the United States would go to nuclear energy right because
(1:24:58) then the the global warming advocates and the ones who think global warming is nonsense that at least they can both
(1:25:05) agree on that nuclear energy is very very clean it's fantastic for everybody we get the most amount of energy most
(1:25:11) amount of bang for our buck i don't have to believe in global warming to know that it's still a good idea right so
(1:25:16) that's one one thing both sides can come to the table on but but here when you're talking about Iran the Israelis do not
(1:25:24) want them to have nuclear power plants because they believe that they can use
(1:25:29) the material which is utilized for nuclear power plants for a nuclear bomb having a nuclear a nuclear armed Iran is
(1:25:37) a critical threat from the Israeli perspective because they think they'll nuke them or at least have the ability
(1:25:42) to do so so I don't know what hand here Trump could have played better the UN
(1:25:47) inspectors are taken for a ride all the time they say it themselves they know for sure that that's the case trump
(1:25:53) knows it's the case right and one thing that can happen is because you can get such bad intel from these inspections
(1:26:00) you can think everything's fine when it's not fine and the Israelis and the MSAD have been saying it's not fine
(1:26:05) right so he seems like he's got kind of a bad hand i think that he wants to renegotiate something with Iran and
(1:26:12) that's what the war drums are about trump has not led us to any new wars he just has not ever done that throughout
(1:26:18) his administrations but he does use saver rattling and threats and he'll pull out of agreements and things like
(1:26:24) that to get people back to the negotiating table for better agreements and I'm hoping to God that's what he's
(1:26:29) leveraging with Iran
