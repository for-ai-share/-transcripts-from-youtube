(0:00) we've never why why is it let me ask you a question how many sexual partners have you had how many have you sucked lauren
(0:06) zero so you're lying no yes uh-huh yes you're lying so that's so rude why would
(0:13) so here's so here's the thing incredibly rude are you serious well i mean if you're going to ask us say this is proof
(0:20) women can lie she's going to say i'm lying because it's proof women can lie about the same thing for us
(0:28) she didn't say she didn't say you were alive it is the same thing does okay i like you a lot more rachel we could be
(0:34) friends no we can't we absolutely cannot because the sound of your voice is like nails on a chalkboard you realize you
(0:40) guys sound exactly the same right no because i don't talk like this
(0:48) you literally sound exactly the same no we don't
(0:58) all right folks buckle up because what you're about to witness
(1:04) might just be andrew wilson's cringiest debate ever and no it's not because of
(1:09) andrew wilson himself he's sharp solid and stays composed as always the cringe
(1:17) that's all courtesy of his opposition this is the kind of debate where andrew
(1:22) wilson calmly lays out facts while the other side seems more interested in
(1:28) making tick- tock points than actually defending coherent ideas it's like
(1:33) watching a lion debate three emotional squirrels if you're new here andrew
(1:39) wilson is known for cutting through nonsense like a buzzsaw through plywood but even he couldn't stop this one from
(1:46) spiraling into unintentional comedy and that's exactly why we're calling it what
(1:52) it is andrew wilson's cringiest debate all right cool all right guys so
(1:58) we're going to be debating two topics um number one is going to be why is it that women initiate 80% of divorces and
(2:05) number two does body count lower a woman's uh inherent dating value so
(2:10) we're gonna we're gonna do about 45 minutes to an hour for each topic or if the one topic gets stale i'll just
(2:16) transition next topic we'll do about two to three minute introductions and then it's going to be pure freestyle format i
(2:22) will only step in if it's getting ridiculous and one person can't talk but generally you guys probably won't hear
(2:28) much from me uh the only thing i'll be doing is just if the conversation gets really really off topic and starting to
(2:33) get weird or if one person can't talk those are the only times i will come in other than that it's going to be pretty much total freefor-all so anyway so
(2:40) we're going to start off with the topic of why do women initiate 80% of divorces we're just going to give a quick opening
(2:45) statement uh lauren you want to kick it off since you're the first one in order yeah i don't think it's as uh people say
(2:52) that initiating divorce is a sign that that's the person ending the relationship but that's just the person
(2:58) who's initiating the legal process and the reason that women would tend to do that is because they are frequently the
(3:05) ones who are relying financially on the man and if they are not receiving uh so
(3:10) for instance if a man is married to a woman and then cuts her off financially
(3:16) and leaves uh he may have ended the relationship but she has to go through the divorce process in order to start
(3:22) devying the money in order for her to survive so that's a very frequent reason
(3:27) and yeah okay solid solid all right andrew you're up next my ma'am
(3:33) yeah the reason that you have such a high divorce rate in the west is due to no fault divorce it's a massive problem
(3:40) the reason that no fault divorce was implemented to begin with is because of feminism and egalitarianism which is
(3:46) completely and totally the wrong way to go about life um it's completely false
(3:51) it's it's um it's faux in every every direction there is no such thing as egalitarianism it's made up tripe and
(3:58) it's been pushed by a feminist agenda for roughly 200 years and uh yeah that's
(4:03) uh that's why you see such a high rate of divorce is due to no fault and we know this because we go back before no
(4:08) fault we can compare and you can see the distinction is massive so i think that
(4:14) you should have merit-based divorce uh and that irreconcilable differences aren't good enough and i also think that
(4:20) secularists probably shouldn't get married at all because it's for the religious and it has nothing to do with them what what what the what the hell do
(4:27) they need to get married for to begin with so that's it all right nina i like i like
(4:34) the whole uh uh non-religious people shouldn't get married part i wholeheartedly agree with that uh nina
(4:40) you're up next uh there's a lot in that sentence that
(4:46) needs to be addressed later but just in general divorce is really complicated it comes from a lot of different factors on
(4:52) both sides of course um i think that a lot of u factors specifically with women
(4:57) typically come from like um like having more of like a social network that you can rely on um actually being willing to
(5:05) take those steps um instead of a lot of dudes i think are just kind of like even if they're unhappy they just kind of
(5:11) like stick it out in terms of like um like well i'm supposed to be married
(5:18) and if i have this like failure if i divorce my wife it's like a
(5:24) social stigma um obviously that goes on both sides but i think it does hit differently for dudes who are not
(5:30) willing to like uh generally they're kind of [ __ ] sometimes when it comes to actually
(5:36) taking that step they'll just be like whatever i guess i'll just die um i think the no fault divorce thing is
(5:42) really [ __ ] stupid of you saying that that's like a bad thing because back in
(5:47) the day you either just made up an excuse like had there was literally businesses that were completely built
(5:54) around the idea of like faking cheating allegations so you could get a divorce so it kind of just was like a it just
(6:01) wasn't a very efficient way to go about doing it so it it really all it is with having no no fault divorces now just
(6:08) means that either uh you're not having to poison your husband anymore or gosh
(6:14) and you don't have to go through all these [ __ ] hoops to just like leave cuz it's not like it just worked on one
(6:21) side it worked on both sides you couldn't just like leave your wife you couldn't just leave your husband like it was not good for either side so i just
(6:28) think that's very silly for you to uh support that okay let's go to angela
(6:33) um yeah so there like i kind of agree with nina and lauren there's so many
(6:38) reasons why a relationship ends and i think one of the major factors uh i think men and women truly don't understand what it takes to coexist in a
(6:45) relationship and though a woman is initiating a divorce it doesn't necessarily mean she's ending it i think there's a lot of things that are
(6:51) stabilizing really bad relationships and a woman choosing to initiate or end the
(6:56) relationship or the divorce um it's just her deciding to i don't know take care of the situation as to a guy is probably
(7:02) having an affair or coping in other ways with video games or just being a complete slob or just giving up in life
(7:08) um i think that maybe like the narrative of men feeding into this egalitarian
(7:14) uh lifestyle or marriage thinking that they can do that but i think women are still carrying the burden of being
(7:20) domestically uh responsible in the relationship whether it's still working and being the
(7:25) wife and being the mom and being all the above while he's still harboring like traditional wife core values which i
(7:31) don't really think it aligns with what we're pushing out here so just summing it up all right cool so we kind of got
(7:38) everyone's position so now is the free-for-all portion anyone can speak at any time good get off guys hey nina did
(7:45) you say that um the only way that men could get it or women could get out of their evil marriages before no fault
(7:51) divorce was to poison their husbands i just want to make sure that we're clear uh did i say that that's the only reason
(7:57) or only way that they could get out no well you know you were you were concerned about the massive non-existent industries that were out trying to prove
(8:03) that you know the women were cheating and i guess that if they couldn't get a divorce their only option of course was
(8:10) to poison their husbands uh that seems ridiculous to me i'm sure i'm sure that
(8:16) you have lots of i think that it's not something that was prevalent yeah okay so how would you get out of a divorce or
(8:23) get sorry get out of a marriage back in the days without no fault divorce so you would go you would go you would go do
(8:29) what's called show cause so you would show a cause and then the court would grant you the divorce what was back then
(8:38) show of cause what was the cause back then andrew well it could be any number of different factors so infidelity could
(8:44) be one factor there was all sorts of different factors it just wasn't irreconcilable differences actually had
(8:50) to have a cause okay so a lot of those factors had to do with domestic violence
(8:57) so you would have um that's one factor yeah so you would had you had an increased amount of false accusations of
(9:04) domestic violence between partners because in order to get out of their divorce they had to have some or false
(9:11) accusations of cheating whereas and these could things could have led to
(9:16) criminal prosecution no fault divorce hasn't changed that no fault divorce hasn't changed to ridiculous allegations
(9:22) of cheating it hasn't changed any of the ridiculous allegations that are levied that are that are levied at people so
(9:28) the thing is is that just saying that there were some isolated cases where they would make these bold claims of uh
(9:34) of lies doesn't it doesn't mean anything it's like first of all the overwhelming amount of divorces right now are due to
(9:41) irreconcilable differences not due to any other factor so i don't assume that
(9:47) something that something because we have polling data we have polling data we have polling data no we don't yes we do
(9:55) so what we have is data that shows that people are filing no fault divorces
(10:00) however you could file for a no fault divorce which is much easier than filing for a at fault divorce and having to
(10:08) show cause as you talked about earlier so even if you do have just cause for a
(10:13) show of cause divorce you would typically just go for a no fault divorce so your data is what does that have to
(10:19) do with anything that literally has nothing to do with what i'm talking about so i'm making a comparison and
(10:25) saying that why do you think that people who say now men and women now the women
(10:31) are saying we have irreconcilable differences and that's why we're getting divorced so because it's easier
(10:39) hang on me or i cheat on my husband lauren lauren calm down let me finish my point and i'll let you talk so you're
(10:47) you have to make the case then that before the irreconcilable differences that people were getting divorced before
(10:52) this under some false pretense which i don't think that they were i think that they were getting divorced under the
(10:58) pretense of show cause which they were supposed to be getting divorced under right you did something wrong you did
(11:03) something which was outside of your marital vows because remember you are taking a vow you do you remember that
(11:08) part lauren if we were to get married part of our vows would be you would never tell me to calm down again but we
(11:14) would never get married i'm happily married i'm glad that um she can't possibly leave her but
(11:21) anyway you should have made that a part of your vows don't tell women to calm down it doesn't help in getting women to
(11:27) calm down oh no what are you going to do freak out oh that's terrible but anyway back to where i was at before i was so
(11:34) rudely interrupted by you lauren i'd like to note that you still haven't actually given me anything here so what
(11:40) i'm asking you specifically is what is the problem with no fault divorce other than you want to get a divorce because
(11:47) you just don't like your husband anymore the reason that i have issue with no
(11:52) fault divorce is because you have to make in order to get a divorce you have to make some sort of an accusation so
(11:59) you have to either accuse your husband of cheating on you or or of hitting you or of doing something and a lot of the
(12:06) times this would lead to criminal proceedings so if you feel drastically stuck it it puts you in a very hard
(12:12) difficult position if you really need to leave and also um even if you do have
(12:19) just cause to gather that evidence so let's say your husband does abuse you in some
(12:25) manner i'm not sure or does cheat on you you would then have to get that gather that evidence and a lot of women don't
(12:31) have the means to hire a pi or to follow their husbands around kind of enjoying
(12:36) the gyocentric way that you're looking at this it's a it's not just the oh the
(12:41) poor woman has to gather has to the poor woman has to
(12:46) gather evidence the man also has to gather evidence the man has to gather evidence for infidelity as well had to
(12:52) gather evidence for these things as well they both have to show cause because they took a vow so if you don't want to
(12:58) take a if you don't if you don't if you don't want to take a vow a marriage vow then why are you getting married well
(13:04) probably for like the legal reasons you know so like what oh so you can't so we
(13:10) we can't change the tax system unless people are married that's ridiculous that's ridiculous i find okay do you
(13:17) find the constitution ridiculous you seem like a fervor supporter of united states and the constitution why would
(13:23) you say that based on because earlier you said that people who are not religious shouldn't be married and it's
(13:29) like funny because we have a first what does that have to do with the constitution well we also have a constitutional right to get married it's
(13:37) you do loving v virginia that's a constitutional that's a constitutional right which amendment is
(13:43) that it's um what amendment i don't think it's in an amendment it's been
(13:49) determined so it's not in the constitution so it's not in the constitution lauren right it's been determined by the supreme court to be a
(13:55) constitutional right okay so it's not in the constitution lauren yeah they can't the government the united states cannot
(14:02) prevent you it's part of your rights to life liberty so is it in the constitution lauren can you give me the amendment lauren do you not understand
(14:09) how supreme court president work yeah that's the president can be overruled
(14:16) lauren president can be overruled for instance it was a constitutional right to have an abortion under a case that
(14:25) was recently overturned so now that's no longer a constitutional right but because it's exact so you do understand
(14:33) president yeah but president's not a constitutional right so if you have a constitutional amendment you either e either need to have two let me finish
(14:40) lauren you need to either have twothirds of the states come together to roll the amendment back or you need to have
(14:46) literally an act yeah well if it's not in the con the 10th amendment i'm sorry you said you
(14:53) said it's in the constitution it's not in the constitution you're talking about
(14:58) case president the 10th amendment the 10th amendment it says that the rights that aren't given to the federal
(15:04) government go to the prospective states lauren what are you talking about no it's the 10th amendment says that there's a number of rights that are not
(15:11) specifically outlined in the constitution like i just said determined under loving v virginia and other cases
(15:17) which part are you disagreeing with the constitutional right people have a constitutional right to choose whom they
(15:23) marry whether they be inter race or and then it was further in hodgees v ogrefeld with gay marriage so people
(15:30) have the choose to the right to choose who they marry that is a constitutional right it's not a constitutional right
(15:38) it's an interpretation by the supreme court and they often get overruled later whereas you can't the supreme court
(15:45) overruled the amendment the right for anyone in the united states to get married to whom they choose whether or
(15:51) not they're religious and i find it odd even though the first amendment so then i can't advocate that there's change so
(15:57) you're just going to continue to interrupt me and then get upset when i interrupt you you seem like well it's it seems to be impossible to have a
(16:03) conversation with you unless it's the most long- winded diet tribe i've ever heard try to keep your points more
(16:09) concise h i think it's hard for you to understand big big concepts i get that
(16:15) i'm trying my hardest maybe if you use small words okay i'll try from now on so
(16:21) andrew are you in favor of a small government uh no why uh because uh small small
(16:30) government usually is mediocre and you need to have x amount of diplomats you need to have x amount of statesmen you
(16:36) have to represent 300 million people in this particular case i would actually advocate that you have far more congressmen that way you didn't have an
(16:43) electoral state which was as messed up as ours is so that's what i mean that's what i
(16:49) would do i would actually expand the electorate because you know having only two senators per state probably not a
(16:55) great idea just so you know and alimony your thoughts on that
(17:01) uh i think that in some rare instances that that can be adjudicated and has
(17:06) been traditionally adjudicated by the church if alimony is necessary the church the church yeah i don't see why
(17:13) the state needs to become involved in a religious ceremony can you give me a reason can you give me
(17:18) a reason why secularists need to get married any of you like why is that why would because they love each other i
(17:25) mean you can love each other without marriage it's a religious it's a religious okay but you might have a
(17:30) tradition in your family like that would want to get married you mean that came from the religious people in your family
(17:36) hold on hold on i'm you want to take the institution of marriage and make it like completely
(17:43) separate from the legal institution so you would get no tax benefits for being a married couple you don't need yeah so
(17:51) just to address these one at a time right mhm you don't need to be married
(17:56) in order to address tax benefits for couples you recognize this right lauren i'm i'm asking if you i'm asking a
(18:03) question i just answered your question you don't actually you don't need to be married
(18:10) for tax benefits because you can address the tax system separate from marriage it's ridiculous okay but there so you
(18:15) think that's the only so oh you mean changing it so he's saying
(18:21) that the only reason that the government is involved in marriage at all is to monitor taxes and then taxes could be
(18:28) monitored i didn't say that at all you just straw man i'm trying to understand she's asking you a question and i just
(18:34) answered her question and then she straw maned the position so like if you want to know the position just ask and i'll
(18:40) give it to you she was literally just doing that like show the [ __ ] no she like literally like wasn't drunk she
(18:46) literally didn't like wasn't so anyway back to what you were asking me lauren
(18:51) just to just give you the answer to your question let me let me rephrase the question if you don't mind how is the
(18:58) government and marriage currently intertwined uh well so right now they're the
(19:04) adjudicators so at the moment you have to go to the state in order to become licensed and you also have to go to the
(19:10) state in order to get the license revoked so essentially they're they they operate as a middleman adjudication
(19:16) system between uh the the partnership and the marriage so i think that that
(19:22) can be done by the church and it doesn't need to be done by the state at all it's not it's never been necessary nor is
(19:28) that something which is traditional that is not a traditional you separated it right so if you separated this into like
(19:34) a a a religious ceremony and you have the states not involved in marriages at
(19:41) all however the state would still monitor couples for the purposes of
(19:46) taxation so would they what would that look like and could the same thing it
(19:52) looks like right now literally look like the same thing it looks like right now religious thing it's no longer for the
(19:57) dignity of family there's like in uh legal precedent a lot of marriage issues have to do with the dignity of families
(20:04) and creating the better the best society possible for the long encouraging birth rates etc etc yeah i agree you're just
(20:10) going to interrupt me every time i talk and then complain if i interrupt you okay well give me the signal when you're
(20:15) done because it sounds like you're winding down so i'm not talking that's when i'm talking let's see if that ever
(20:21) happens but go ahead i could i could see why you complain about uh no fault divorces i could see you wanting to
(20:28) grasp onto your wife as best as you can i could see that running oh great that what a what a swell argument are you
(20:34) going to get to an argument because i'm still waiting for one dude i lost my i i'm sure you did go ahead say what you
(20:40) were going to say cuz you wanted to interrupt me so much well wait a second wait a second you're saying that just a minor interruption you derailed your
(20:47) entire train you guys are both doing the same thing right now just get to your points both of you for the little girl you get to your point andrew my point is
(20:54) is that you don't need to have the state involved in marriage at all okay so so
(20:59) how is that system going to work so now the state is not involved in marriages but however you say the state is still
(21:05) involved in couples being taxed differently than single people so then
(21:11) couples will also want to be triples for tax purposes maybe business partners um
(21:16) and then also maybe father and daughter maybe would want for tax purposes to
(21:21) live together so will that be allowed by the state does this change things because it's no longer a sexual family
(21:28) dynamic monitor so i'm curious as how this is now going to work in your new society and also are so so here i'll
(21:37) answer okay sorry go ahead i thought you were done talking my bad go ahead you got the floor i'll let you answer that
(21:44) okay so first of all all you're talking about here is changing one position which is that the government itself no
(21:51) longer issues marriage licenses they don't need to do it for the purposes of taxation they still are going to track
(21:56) who's cohabitating they've always tracked who's cohabitate ating we have the us census which is great at doing
(22:02) this you have social security numbers for your job and if you want to have tax benefits and tax breaks and things like
(22:07) that you could maybe engage in what's called a civil union there are states which have had those for an awful long
(22:13) time and you can do that that's how homosexuals used to be able to get married is through a civil union they
(22:18) would get all of the same protections of a marriage without it being the actual sacrament of marriage and then if you
(22:23) want to have no fault divorce for your secular marriages fine but i think that
(22:29) that you should probably push for some kind of sacrament or some kind of value
(22:36) to marriage if you want people to remain married i can demonstrate this by the fact that religious people get divorced
(22:41) less yet they seem to be happier in their marriages do you know the legal distinctions between a civil marriage
(22:49) i couldn't hear you say that again do you know the legal distinctions between a civil union and a marriage depends on
(22:57) the state okay but for instance when a spouse dies in a civil union do they
(23:03) receive the uh the estate or part of the estate especially in a homestead state
(23:09) like florida i mean let's assume for a second none of them could you as the secularist who in introduced civil
(23:15) unions instead of marriage could easily ratify that for whatever secular framework that you wanted so whatever
(23:21) non-religious framework that you wanted to add in and call it a civil union another than religious union you could
(23:27) add in whatever the hell you wanted so this is essentially marriage but with a
(23:32) different terminology whatever you want to call it we wouldn't recognize it as marriage we would recognize you as like
(23:38) people then why don't churches just have their own ceremony that they don't recognize the state they do the state
(23:45) doesn't recognize that ceremony don't catholics not recognize the state divorce anyway so they they already do
(23:53) this so i'm going to explain this so that you understand the state itself does not recognize religious marriage by
(23:59) itself so the state itself still has to issue a license and you are still subject to the state for the purposes of
(24:06) you being able to get divorced you understand the distinction there there's a huge distinction yeah religiously
(24:13) because if you're catholic the priest still won't sanctify your divorce so you won't be considered divorced and i know
(24:19) this because my dad's catholic and my there was issue on my with my grandma with divorce whatever and her catholics
(24:26) are really weird about that stuff i agree so yeah so even though her partner
(24:31) wanted a divorce from his wife to marry my grandma he couldn't he had to wait for her to die in order to marry my
(24:37) grandma even though she was legally divorced because the church wouldn't recognize
(24:42) your dream world already exists no it doesn't so first of all the catholic the
(24:48) church has a different catholic church of marriage than the state but the church did it you're
(24:55) missing the point the enforcement arm is not the church the enforcement arm is still the state so he he still had to go
(25:02) stop and let me finish he still had to go and get divorced by the state right
(25:10) i mean if it was just religious um answer my question did he have to go to
(25:15) the state divorced if he i mean no because he had to wait for his wife to die right well you just got them saying
(25:22) that he got divorced but he couldn't still leave the marriage because the catholic church wouldn't let him right right so now you're asking okay so then
(25:29) he did have to go to the state and the state did have to give him a divorce way he had to wait for his wife to die
(25:37) because he was adhering to his religious institution but he still had to go to the state lauren to get a divorce lauren
(25:44) you just said he did he wanted to separate the state the state ties of his
(25:50) marriage which is what the state would be regulating in this civil union system that you're setting up anyway no the
(25:56) state wouldn't be regulating anything with with religious marriage why would they be regulating now you want so now
(26:01) you want the church to dictate the separation which would be the cause of of these which would yes i want the
(26:08) church to if you're going to do a sacment when i'm in when i'm asking a question i'm answering your question yes
(26:14) the answer is yes i want the church to adjudicate that have you heard of the separation of church and state have you
(26:20) heard of this concept this would separate the church and state what are you talking about wait hold on i think we're kind of getting going in circles a
(26:26) little bit here i just want to try and keep us back on track so i guess i i'm not necessarily cutting anyone off here
(26:32) but like andrew like if you can already get married via the church without being
(26:38) legally binding currently then what are you complaining about why did you get
(26:43) married for a legal purpose which i assume you did i'm
(26:49) not sure your particular situation like if you're saying that you could just do a ceremony with the church right that's
(26:56) what you're wanting yes no current current currently priests cannot marry you without the state well
(27:02) i mean but it would be like you could have that within like your religious practice it just wouldn't be legally binding correct no you well you really
(27:08) can't have that because but that's what you want yes yes there's laws that make that illegal so usually a priest make it
(27:15) illegal a priest yes a priest often in most in most states i think actually has
(27:21) to uh have the authority of the state and issue you a marriage license in order to marry you are you talking about
(27:27) bigamy laws no i'm not talking about bigamy laws well i just don't understand why you
(27:32) can't just have that done what law are you referring to cuz i've never heard of a law that a religious ceremony couldn't
(27:39) take place without the state's permission i've literally never heard of this so you can make you can make that
(27:44) but it's not a recognized marriage the state should still have to recognize recognized by the state but you don't
(27:49) want it to recognize the state the state stop the state should still have to recognize the marriage that doesn't mean
(27:55) that they have the authority to adjudicate it stop proving i'm making bad points stop what you are making bad
(28:02) points no you're the one making bad points okay what's the what's the problem with my argument
(28:09) give me an actual problem with my argument let me let me frame it the best
(28:14) way i possibly can it is i'm trying i'm trying that's why i'll try to frame it as best i can the state does not need to
(28:21) adjudicate religious marriage however the state should have to recognize religious marriage what does that mean
(28:26) it means that the state is going to have to recognize that you're married by the church and and recognize the church's
(28:32) authority to be the adjudicator over the divorce portion of it but what does that mean in i just explained it how stupid
(28:39) are you like i just literally explained it you really didn't explain that at all so how much more explain this last name
(28:48) yeah like like the last name just keep answering the same question
(28:53) like what are we you did not answer that question at all okay so as far as it comes to what tax benefits things like
(28:59) this yes is that what you mean when you say recognized yeah that is what i'm saying whatever whatever the the
(29:04) benefits are that the state's going to offer up or whatever yes it needs to be recognized be involved in adjudication
(29:12) of state issues involved well it's not it's not just a state issue the state
(29:17) the state is a composition of people sure exactly the state's a composition of people lauren okay so people should be
(29:25) able to be allowed to have their own adjudicators separate of the state and they traditionally always have so i
(29:32) don't know what you're talking about always have since what time period
(29:37) throughout most of history the church has been the dominion united states the church has been the dominion over
(29:44) divorce throughout most of human history these are religious sacraments these are
(29:49) not secularist sacraments that that only began during the enlightenment period
(29:54) when they really started to push through laws when it came to divorce in order to promote the health and welfare of the
(30:00) individuals inside of these nations but the when in the united states did this happen i don't know what the exact dates
(30:07) were never no listen did the united states change
(30:13) from no fault divorce that happened but that's completely different than it did okay so hang on
(30:19) before then there if you're if you're going backwards it's ridiculous for you to expect me to know the exact date that
(30:26) this change shifted drastically so yes it has happened i just told you traditionally the church has always been
(30:33) the adjudicator for who got married and who got divorced yes who do you who do you think founded
(30:39) the united states lauren who do you think founded it who got here first like in what sense blue who got to america on
(30:48) the united like are they vikings or probably are you talking about the country like i'm so confused it's like
(30:56) the united states the united states had the united states had puritans lauren
(31:02) the united states had puritans who got here puritan christians okay they were not appealing to the state because the
(31:07) church was the state okay they were the state they put up the constitution of
(31:13) the united states no that came later oh oh okay so it's not the so the united
(31:18) states never right had the church adjudicating you mean the same united states that claims all men are created
(31:25) are created equal doesn't say anything about women being created equal didn't allow women to have suffrage didn't allow women to have any of those things
(31:31) didn't allow women to vote because they weren't stakeholders also gave them made sure that they had limited access to
(31:37) property aren't these all feminist aren't these all feminist prop uh propaganda what a pivot
(31:45) what you're asking me to give you a precision date for some i don't know that off the top of my head never
(31:51) happened you're doing a really good job of that tell me what never happened let's make sure there's never a period
(31:58) in united states history when the church was adjudicating marriages for the purposes of taxation or any other legal
(32:04) benefits well no that's not true the entire 17 hang on the entire 1700s the
(32:11) state had limited involvement in marriage what are you talking about the proestant is protestant sex there wasn't
(32:19) hardly any taxes in the 1700s lauren i'm sorry do you know what the revolutionary
(32:25) war was paid or was done over what are you talking about oh my god how dumb are
(32:31) you what does it have to do with anything well i'm asking you do you do you know why the revolutionary war was started i know that what the
(32:38) propagandist said in the revolutionary war the united states propagandist i think that the i think that the war
(32:45) well regardless of why i think the war was fought that really has no bearing or merit on any of this no taxation without
(32:51) representation that was propaganda in case you forgot that was patriot propaganda said it was patriot exactly
(32:57) doesn't mean it didn't happen you understand propaganda doesn't mean that it's a lie oh great well now we have tons of taxation with representation
(33:03) wasn't the tea party wasn't like the whole tea party thing being taxed too
(33:09) much so you're telling us there's no taxes and this entire [ __ ] country was found i didn't say that i just said
(33:15) there wasn't very many taxes and i got to tell you that the entire reason was because there
(33:21) was taxes the purpose of merit no that wasn't the entire reason for the revolutionary war that's insane you're
(33:27) talking about the boston tea party and you're talking about patriot propaganda which happened the patriot propaganda
(33:33) was necessary for the war effort okay i support my country i don't appreciate
(33:39) your [ __ ] here oh i'm mad that i'm siding the liberals
(33:46) i just want to say that i like you that's unfortunate i'm even wearing a conservative shirt damn all right let's
(33:54) let's redirect we no let's not redirect i'm not done yet i want to know i would like to know when do you guys think the
(34:01) income tax started okay one question i want to redirect back to this yeah when do you think it started with that i
(34:07) forgot the amendment but i should it's okay for you to not know anything off the top of your head right yeah go ahead
(34:13) google it uh 17 was it the 17th amendment when did the income tax start
(34:21) 1861 what was it 1861 um no civil war
(34:27) prompted the first american income tax in 1861 yeah okay that was for the war effort but the actual income tax that
(34:33) you have now right that started in the 1900s just so you understand the 1900s
(34:38) that was a good so now as you so now as you move so now as you move back hang on
(34:44) so now was it the 1700 so i want to redirect back to initial topic but we covered history quite enough let's it's
(34:50) not related at all to the yes it is related to because we're talking about the history of marriage alex how is that
(34:57) related to the idea of uh why forces give you like a simple because because
(35:03) in this because in this particular because in this particular case what they're trying to say is that i have
(35:08) some kind of incoherent system and yet i'm saying no it's actually your system which is incoherent which is leading to
(35:14) the maximum amount of divorces which we're having at the moment right because specifically
(35:20) because specifically no fault divorce so if you're looking at you know divorce rates are falling let finish
(35:27) calm down lauren so again again when you're when you're looking at this no fault divorce is a primary cause for why
(35:34) it is that women institute so this is what the question is right why do women
(35:40) uh have or institute so many divorces why are they petitioning so much for divorce things like this it's actually
(35:45) really simple it's because there's very limited penalty at all for women to go
(35:51) and uh petition the court for a divorce they almost always win and they almost always uh get more assets this has been
(35:59) what has traditionally happened since no fault divorce was instituted they usually get the kids they usually get
(36:04) the house it's a pretty bad deal for men it's a big problem that's why we got
(36:09) into all these other things okay let's just try to keep it on track with you want to talk about the history of divorce or whatever that's fine but
(36:15) let's not get into like [ __ ] income taxes and whatnot and like why the why the revolution happened like that's not really quite related but yeah sure did
(36:22) you know fun fact us divorce rates hit an all-time 50-year low
(36:27) isn't that a fun fact because almost nobody's getting married that's why
(36:33) so that's what you want you don't want the secular people getting married how low tier you people are no but you
(36:40) literally just said you didn't want the secular people getting married so maybe those are the people who are not getting married right so what i want to do is
(36:47) shift people i want to shift definitely it's a rel to get married so i want to
(36:52) shift so so here's what you are seeing though you are seeing religious people stay married longer they're happier
(36:59) longer the more religious they are the less likely they are to be divorced the less likely a woman is to institute a
(37:05) divorce all those great things that's why i want to see more people move towards religion as a grounding for why
(37:11) they get married in the first place as a sacrament so they take it seriously instead of secularists who make vows and
(37:17) then go "but i didn't like johnny anymore because johnny got fat so i decided to go bang the neighbor right?"
(37:23) and then they go "well there's no fault divorce there's very little penalty for him." and so they institute a divorce
(37:28) they they they push a divorce men and women cheat at the same rates generally so i i don't really understand what
(37:34) that's going with but um do you really think that like you should just not ever have any reason to leave or like is it
(37:42) the do you actually believe in the fault divorces or are you just saying that to be like annoying about
(37:48) it or do you believe that nobody should ever be divorced i i don't know what your position is on this you think steven crowder's wife should have been
(37:55) allowed to divorce him great question if if you have a show cause for abuse
(38:01) actual physical abuse or you have a show cause for infidelity or abandonment
(38:07) emotional abuse or abandonment right i think that those are all good causes when you're talking about things like
(38:13) emotional abuse try to remember what your vows are through better through worse sometimes in marriage you're going
(38:20) to have years not months not weeks but years that might be really rough they
(38:25) might be hard marriage is really hard people shouldn't enter into marriage they shouldn't enter into marriage
(38:31) unless they're prepared for all those hard times i don't disagree that marriage is hard it's scary i i
(38:36) understand like um that aspect of it but like if somebody is abusing you and you have
(38:44) kids like even if it's emotionally why do you think that they wouldn't abuse your children and on the second uh
(38:53) question i'll let you finish or i'll let you answer in a second but let me just finish my question real quick
(38:59) um would you think that it is okay to leave a marriage if the your partner
(39:05) whether it is you know man wife whatever um is abusing your kids do you think
(39:13) that's fair to leave that marriage or or more than anything i would even think like maybe it's like your duty that you
(39:19) should for the good of your children if your partner is abusing your children
(39:24) should you be able to leave them is that what you're asking this is a two-parter
(39:29) basically saying like if somebody is going to do one part you okay that's fair um we'll start with the first part
(39:35) if somebody is going to abuse you like um emotionally or physically why do you
(39:42) think that they wouldn't i'm saying both let me um do you think
(39:47) that they're not going well i need to clarify okay would you not think that they would do that to your children if
(39:54) if you have a spouse who's physically abusive i think or emotionally well the problem with emotional abuse is that
(40:01) it's highly subjective and i don't know exactly what it means so i know what physical abuse means and i think that
(40:06) all of us would agree with what physical abuse is you think like gaslighting would be that good stop stop me knowing
(40:11) the answer right okay i think all of us would agree what physical abuse is i think all of us would agree what infidelity is i think all of us would
(40:18) agree what abandonment is not sure all of us would agree on what emotional abuse is okay well i guess i will like
(40:25) try and clarify then um is something like like somebody who's gaslighting you constantly or like i mean like you saw
(40:32) the steven crowder stuff right uh-huh like you do you think that what he was doing to her was not emotionally abusive
(40:39) maybe so what well i wait how does that what do you
(40:44) mean so what so what if his if the kids are witnessing that throughout like a 10-year marriage and you think that will affect the way they well that's
(40:50) different so now you're so now you're talking so now you're asking about some elongated pattern of behavior that's
(40:56) like never ending or something like this rather than an isolated incident so here's what i'll say right as as you
(41:03) guys kind of giggle and scoff which i find amusing um all of you every single
(41:08) one of you have been have been have been mean to a man right or have had men be
(41:14) mean to you every single one of you have had engagements with men especially your
(41:20) you know whoever you're dating or something like this where the guy's been a [ __ ] or you've been a [ __ ] to
(41:25) the guy but that didn't mean that you broke up the relationship over that a marriage is something that's much or
(41:32) should be much more difficult to break up than just some relationship you have with a boyfriend and the thing is
(41:39) human let me finish let me finish and i'll turn it over i promise but okay
(41:44) emotionally if you're talking about emotional abuse i think that that's really difficult for us to agree on what
(41:51) that's going to be because i think a person could maybe even emotionally abuse you for 3 or 4 years and then stop
(41:57) doing it marriage is work or whatever you consider to be emotional abuse or you them marriage is work relationships
(42:04) are work relationship dynamics are work now let me ask you this before you guys ask me another question who here besides
(42:10) me is married raise your hand oh wow you researched us you're married
(42:16) angela yeah are you are you lying angela just
(42:22) curious uh no why would i lie what do i what i gain from lying i don't know i'm
(42:27) just curious lying because she's a woman i like my green card guys i got like my green card leave me alone yes i am
(42:33) married and you're not going through a divorce
(42:39) uh no why would no i i would like to stay in america so no i'm not going through a divorce i don't know you just raised your hand really slow it was
(42:45) weird just saying well i didn't know there was like a follow-through question and i was like "all right what what's going on?" well i'm just saying like
(42:50) before you guys are so quick to say anything about what's emotional abuse or what isn't maybe you should be married
(42:57) to know which one is what my problem with what we're talking about is like i understand what you're saying
(43:02) but if you've been in a if you're married and maybe maybe you're comparing it to like a modern marriage where people get married within like the first
(43:08) two years of meeting but like if you've been with someone long enough and and you're saying that this behavior will slowly go away if the behavior goes away
(43:14) whether somebody is just ignoring the situation it's only going to get worse but i don't see how a guy can be emotionally abusive and then just slowly
(43:20) not be emotionally abusive anymore i i don't see like how like if you're in a relationship with somebody what's
(43:25) emotional so let's start with this then if it's going to be pedantic tell me what you think emotional abuse is uh she
(43:32) gave an example of gaslighting um deprive i would say depriving of funds i
(43:39) would say um why is depriving of funds emotional abuse so for instance i know
(43:44) somebody who her husband would go out on trips i don't care about an anecdote i care about the argument why would
(43:49) depriving somebody anecdotes are not an argument give me an argument an argument it's an example you asked for an example
(43:56) i didn't ask i asked specifically for an argument so what i want to know answer the way that i was going to answer i
(44:02) want what i want to know specifically is an argument for why it is that deprivation of funds is emotional abuse
(44:10) okay i'm going to give you an example of course of how deprivation of funds is emotional abuse i know someone whose
(44:17) husband would go on trips and even though they had a newborn baby and she was in college he would cut off their
(44:24) credit card when he would go on trips and she and he wouldn't tell her how
(44:30) long and sometimes it would be days sometimes it would be months she would not know and so she would just have to
(44:38) survive on the food in her clos like food that she had in her pantry eventually she would have to go to her
(44:44) mom and ask for food it was emotionally abusive okay well i know a couple and
(44:50) what they do is he deprivives her of money because he thinks that she spends
(44:55) hang on no you hold on i just went through your whole diet just went through your entire no it
(45:02) doesn't i'm giving you a counter example of how it doesn't so i know everybody in the exact same type of situation exact
(45:07) same type of way just the opposite is true refute it okay ref give me a reputation well you ask so the
(45:14) deprivation of funds and whatever my anecdotal scenario is is good there we go so now we're at a stalemate give me i
(45:21) don't understand the exact i know you don't understand so he's he's doing a deprivation of
(45:26) funds and it's actually good because it works for their marriage instead of she doesn't like it i guess you know
(45:32) whatever the aneote i'm curious what is your anecdote i'm actually curious so the anecdote would be that she spent too
(45:37) much she spends too much money because she spends too much money he cut off the credit card payment so he deprivives her
(45:43) of funds that's good and healthy for the couple i've known couples where this has happened to them here's an anecdote for
(45:48) you there you go refuted okay well then that's probably not yeah well then that's probably not if it's something
(45:55) that like she has an issue and well no it's actually emotional abuse to him huh how dare she make it so that that poor
(46:01) guy has to freeze her credit cards she'd love he'd love to share her money with her you might be that's fine but that
(46:07) doesn't that doesn't discount what her argument was and what what's her argument argument was an anecdote not an
(46:14) argument remember like it's an example it's an geometry andrew those things are
(46:19) not mutually exclusive what i'm wondering what year you took
(46:25) basic what the [ __ ] does that have to do with tea party geometry is i struggle with
(46:34) logic structures because of geometry well not because it's not geometry's
(46:39) fault okay lauren let me ask you a question there's three laws of logic can
(46:44) you name them for me what you mean three laws of lo so are you saying like for instance um if a then b yeah the three
(46:53) laws three laws of logic there's only three can you name even one of them yeah it's like if a then b if oh i don't
(47:03) remember like you would you would have to know this off the top maybe you should have stayed in geometry i guess identity nonradition excluded middle
(47:11) like i mean you should have stay should have stayed in geometry you really dumb that you make yourself look andrew when
(47:17) yeah i made myself look dumb that's for sure easily google like you're really going to think like it makes her look
(47:22) stupid that you're just like "hey name like" like like you're basically doing the same logical argument of like the uh
(47:27) that she did the same name three songs from the band like
(47:33) it's like we could just look it up that's what she so she asked me then so
(47:39) she asked me when when did you when did you fail when did you fail geometry for your logical argumentation structure i
(47:46) got a perfect score in geometry i went on to get a perfect score on the math i went on to get a perfect score and then
(47:53) i went on to be a math major what does geometry have to do with the logical structure lauren there's logical that
(48:00) you seem to be failing so for instance when i gave the anecdotal example of how deprivation to the bathroom can be and
(48:07) this is actually one of the logic structures you were just talking about so maybe you know them off the top of your head but you don't know how to
(48:12) apply them which seems to be an issue for you if i give an example how deprivation of funds can be abused you
(48:19) giving an example of how deprivations of funds could not be abused is not discrediting the fact that my example
(48:25) was still right both are both are non sequittors lauren that's my point yeah
(48:31) they're both nonsequittors going back to your anecdot how to cut off the funds like off of your example for someone
(48:38) who's married is that is that what you would do for your marriage if somebody was spending if your wife was spending too much money just to cut off the funds
(48:43) just to like teach her a lesson what would what would you do well it's not teaching a lesson but i have children
(48:48) she has children with me i think that it's very important that if somebody if one of the partners is being irresponsible with money uh that it's a
(48:57) duty to in fact to cut off funding so that they're not no longer irresponsible with money and i think that often times
(49:04) especially if you look at consumer spending women are responsible for upwards of 70 to 80% of all consumer
(49:10) spending they spend a lot of money so the thing is is that often times it's a
(49:15) misleading thought because that women spend money on a lot of things like household stuff and everything i agree listen i agree what i'm saying to you
(49:23) though is that generally speaking they spend a lot of money so you're going to
(49:28) often find that when financial disputes come up inside of marriages it's not usually the man who's overspending they
(49:35) do don't get me wrong it happens but often times it's a woman who's overspending and so it falls under the
(49:40) duty and purview of of the man to say no you can't overspend and if he's the bread winner and he's the provider for
(49:47) the family why would it be problematic for him to say that this money needs to be used in a way i deem responsible for
(49:53) the family so then you don't do the shopping right but i wanted to so you're
(49:58) saying basically to cut it off but wouldn't that be a red flag as to why she randomly started to aggressively spend on this money because if someone
(50:05) who's married and that their personality drastically changes wouldn't that be a reason to find the root of why instead
(50:10) of just saying i'm going to cut this off and starting the beginning of why relationship fails because of the lack of communication yeah so so i think
(50:16) you're conflating two different things so if you're asking me do you think that we should get to the root of the problem
(50:22) of why the woman is spending so much money i would say sure but that really doesn't negate the point that if she is
(50:27) spending too much money and the dude puts a freeze on the money that he seems to be justified in doing so i don't
(50:33) think it's justified because you're not necessarily stopping the situation you're just putting it on pause and it's only going to find other ways in the
(50:39) relationship well it's both and is what i'm saying angel it's both and so you can put a stop on it while you get to the root of the problem but i was going
(50:47) off of your example and it just seemed like you didn't really my example my my my example is both and you can do both
(50:52) things at one time you don't have to do one or the other you can do both and then you can do the other thing as well so again marriage is work if you're
(50:59) going to be working on your marriage you have to freeze the funds obviously you're going to be working with your wife on why it is that she needs to be
(51:05) spending this money in the correct manner this type of thing i think that's totally the fact that depriving funds
(51:11) can maybe not always but can be a form of emotional abuse and you asked what
(51:17) other forms of emotional abuse are there other than gaslighting i gave an example of how depriving funds can be emotional
(51:24) abuse and so now i'm asking you're saying that only the church should be allowed to determine whether or not
(51:29) that's emotional abuse and that shouldn't be adjudicated by the court can holding out can holding out on sex be emotional abuse yes yes okay so can
(51:38) basically everything be emotional abuse just depending on the subjective interpretation of one partner
(51:44) isn't that really what's true that everything under the sun could be why court systems and part of legislation
(51:51) when they decided to make no fault divorce available was because so much of this court system was wrapped up in
(51:57) determining these subjective arguments of he said she said in the first place well no not just that but there was also
(52:04) a push from a feminist arm in the united states especially under the reagan administration yes i've read you should
(52:09) also read a book called otult feminism by my wife and it'll go over all of this
(52:14) just so you know and yes that was a shameless plug sponsored have you read
(52:20) the justifications that legislators have made for the reason in which they have
(52:26) implemented no fault divorces in their state and why other legislators in their various states have still kept some sort
(52:34) of uh at fault divorce available for those who want it covenant marriages
(52:40) those justification for no fault divorce is not even recent so there you'll find justifications throughout feminist
(52:46) literature going back all the way to the early listen i'm answering your question no
(52:52) you're not yes i am let me finish you'll find justification literature going back
(52:58) all the way to the 1800s for an attempt to push no fault divorce or being able
(53:04) to get divorced for no reason at all because you want to it's part of the women's liberation movement they've been
(53:10) pushing for this forever under reagan there was all sorts of different justifications which were pushed for it
(53:16) but here's the thing reagan started in california by doing this and then he made it nationwide it was a huge mistake
(53:22) how did civilization survive lauren pre reagan instituting no fault divorce how
(53:28) how i mean why didn't everything just blow up okay so i love how you pivot from
(53:34) answering the question and give me another question but i'm just going to repeat my question like the most thorough way i could have answered it
(53:40) what the legislators wrote which legislator there's various legislators yeah give me
(53:46) one name you don't know one name you ask me a question if i've
(53:54) read my so under the footnotes of give me one name well just just let her
(53:59) answer the question just just answer mine give me a name and then i can answer the question you don't know the name
(54:06) is she even asking me the question which uh supreme court justice wrote
(54:12) that i couldn't give you the name i've read loving virginia i couldn't give you the name of the supreme j do you know
(54:18) the supreme court have i read the justifications of the people whose names you don't know this is big brain stuff
(54:24) i'm asking under the footnotes of all of these laws for instance the creation of the covenant law you could look up why a
(54:31) legislator wrote that into the law and they give their rationale and i'm asking that's nice of them no i haven't read
(54:37) everything uh that everybody's ever written lauren yes yeah then why are you expecting her to have done that like
(54:43) because she she because if she if she applies the standard to me of have you read x but she can't even tell me the
(54:49) person whose name i should note it doesn't matter you're just learning you
(54:55) have to know every little aspect that's if you ask me a question if you ask me
(55:00) question x nina nina if you ask me a question have you read what x person has
(55:06) said and i say x person's name and you say i don't know your credibility goes
(55:11) to zero no that's because people forget names very silly author's name there's plenty of
(55:18) things that i've read that i don't know the author's name haven't read a lot of things without noting the author's name i'd be curious
(55:25) how much you've read in your life which appears to be books what was your question you know
(55:31) what i will google it for you my guy if you don't know the name either like i don't know like i will google it for you what was
(55:37) your question when that you were getting all pissed off and like trying to pivot and distract from um uh her line of
(55:44) thought to answer you don't remember you don't remember the question that you're going to do you want me to repeat the
(55:50) question i was looking up something else by all means okay so the legislators who
(55:56) wrote like for instance uh georgia does georgia have covenant divorces okay i i
(56:03) don't know the the various states in which have covenant divorces they typically write a treatise as to why
(56:10) they wrote why they created a covenant divorce or why they got rid or why they
(56:15) changed the legislature i'm wondering if you've read any of these treatises no
(56:20) okay so you don't know any of the legislators justifications for getting rid of at fault divorces well no that's
(56:28) not what i said there's more to a legislation process than a treatise so
(56:33) there's all sorts of political justifications which are done on the national and localized level by several
(56:38) different authors oftentimes legislation like this is not even drafted by the person who writes it it's drafted by
(56:44) external parties lauren so no i may have read quite a bit on it uh but that doesn't mean i've read an example of a
(56:50) treatise directly so okay if you've read quite a bit on it can you please give us some of the reasons and why these
(56:56) legislators chose to get rid of at fault divorces where and which legislature
(57:02) let's just say um new york okay and which legislature under who who introduced the
(57:09) legislation any any i'm asking you why and i'm just asking you to give me the answer so that
(57:15) i can answer your question i don't you don't know specific
(57:20) legislature so don't ask me stupid questions lauren stop asking stupid questions it definitely comes off like
(57:27) you you know what you're talking about you're not just definitely andrew i'm asking you a broad question and you're
(57:34) asking me to pin it down to a specific person i'm asking you what is the rationale legislators gave for getting
(57:41) rid of at fault divorce where and which legislature why not new york new york
(57:46) for example okay which legislator literally any you're saying that you've read some of
(57:53) these decisions and it's a more broad thing it's more general and there's these public it it wasn't just are you
(57:58) asking me if i know so i just want to make sure i get this right if you're asking me andrew do you know a specific
(58:05) legislative body and their justifications inside of new york for why they did x thing the answer to this
(58:11) particular question is no what's your point give me any rale that these that
(58:16) these legislators gave for any legislator in any jurisdiction gave for
(58:22) changing the law to no fault divorce sorry to at fault divorce to no fault
(58:28) divorce yes i can give you what the reagan administrative reagan administration said why is that so
(58:33) [ __ ] difficult for you okay because well next time next time just be either concise with your question or make it
(58:39) wasn't going to do this whole thing just just let's just stay in focus go ahead anyway yeah so the reagan administration
(58:45) they they pushed this in california much of the justification for it came from
(58:51) literally the liberal arts section of california liberal universities and what
(58:57) they were pushing at the time was that women were subject to all sorts of different types of abuses and that the
(59:04) patriarchal system in which they were living under were oppressive to them and
(59:09) this was a huge push in california and as they say as goes california so goes
(59:15) the rest of the united states so yes those were many of the justifications which were given at the time uh for why
(59:22) it was that we needed no fault divorce but there's other uh far more specific examples going even further back in
(59:28) history as feminists have been pushing this for a long time all right i'm going to give a fiveminute
(59:34) warning before we move on to the next topic uh because we've been going about for an hour so just a heads up for everybody and so these legislators
(59:41) didn't base this idea that women were suffering or um maybe an abnormal amount
(59:47) of abuse compared to men in these divorce in these inability to have no false divorces
(59:54) they did offer those up as justifications yeah okay so they had there was a legitimate doesn't mean that
(1:00:00) their justifications were good it just means they offered them up as justifications so you don't think women
(1:00:05) going through abuses is a good justification i don't think that the justifications which are offered for why
(1:00:11) it should be no fault if you're going through abuses is justified no do you also now lauren let me ask you the same
(1:00:17) question back have you read any of the counterarguments to any of these justifications yeah usually when you
(1:00:23) read the counter arguments arguments is that it will increase divorce it
(1:00:29) will increase the increase divorce of course it was going to increase the
(1:00:36) amount of abuse so there was there was ben the issue that was at hand which was
(1:00:42) women being in abusive relationships and not being able to gather the evidence and be able to afford an attorney
(1:00:47) without their husband finding out because typically their husband monitored finances so these women were stuck in
(1:00:54) these abusive relationships and now they're capable of getting outro there going to be an increase in
(1:01:00) california over time there was a decrease in divorce but lauren in california who wrote that counterargument oh my god i don't care
(1:01:07) honestly andrew i i think you have to prove why is um people who are unhappy and married why is that ridiculous
(1:01:13) divorce i don't i read it i don't necessarily you don't have to know the author of everything that you read then
(1:01:18) how do we know that it's true how do we know that it's true can you show it to me oh my gosh you just seem to have
(1:01:24) maybe read like five things in your life okay wait wait okay hold on we only have a little bit of time left can you show it to me i want to i want to ask andrew
(1:01:32) why is divorce inherently bad for you that it like if it's going through a bunch of abuses why do you think that it
(1:01:38) shouldn't be fair for somebody to leave because your primary the primary edict of a marriage is not about you and it's
(1:01:44) not about your spouse it's about your children okay and continuously keeping
(1:01:50) keeping continuity inside of your family is the most important thing that you can do the outcomes for children and you're
(1:01:56) all consequentialists i'm sure the outcomes for children are almost always better if they stay inside of your
(1:02:03) household let me give you an example of how bad this is nina let's say that you have children in a house filled to the
(1:02:09) brim with abuse and you remove the children and hand them over to the state they're 100 times more likely to be abused by the state than they would have
(1:02:16) been inside of their abusive home great that's actually a fantastic argument for divorce then they should stay with the
(1:02:21) parent that is not abusing them correct for physical abuse i've never disputed this okay so then you should support
(1:02:29) divorce no that's not well under the the pretense of physical abuse i've already
(1:02:34) said that that's a justified reason for divorce nina okay is there any line for
(1:02:39) emotional abuse and now it's a calling question so i think that the church is far better at adjudicating this than the
(1:02:45) state is so there isn't a line but there is a line famously not bad
(1:02:51) at love that famously not bad the state is f who's famously not bad come on nina
(1:02:57) the state is awful when it comes to adjudication yeah absolutely no democrat
(1:03:04) now let me let me explain the rale let's trust the [ __ ] i'll explain no i wouldn't trust the catholic church but
(1:03:10) let me explain the rationale so that you understand i'm going to explain the rationale for for why it is that the
(1:03:16) church would be better at adjudicating this than the state the church would be better because you're part of the church
(1:03:21) because you're a part of the church's congregation they know you your priest knows you this is a community which
(1:03:27) knows you they they have intricate knowledge of your intricate details whereas a judge and especially a state
(1:03:33) judge or a stateapp appointed judge they know very little about you very little exactly they're impartial very little
(1:03:39) they're not impartial if they were impartial then they wouldn't be giving women everything in divorces
(1:03:45) what they don't give women everything in yeah they have traditional you are so afraid of your wife leaving you i think
(1:03:50) it's very hilarious uh so once again first of all you can't have this church
(1:03:57) adjudicate things that are interwoven with the state because you can't have the church adjudicate like that's just
(1:04:03) it's just unconstitutional i'm sorry and then and you seem to care about the constitution i think you do not i don't
(1:04:09) know i can't really tell with you um is there any line for emotional abuse is
(1:04:14) there a line because you consider emotional abuse can be anything at any
(1:04:20) time and dependent upon subjective no question actually it's not a yes or no
(1:04:25) question how long have you question how long have you been a [ __ ] yes or no question how is there a
(1:04:32) line have you been a [ __ ] it's a yes or no question i i just passed the bar and i i i went to law school so like i feel
(1:04:39) that's not yes or no that's not yes or no lauren that's not yes i don't know how long i've been a [ __ ] cuz i've always thought i was pretty smart but
(1:04:46) back to answering your question emotional abuse yeah so so i'm going to answer this question okay there actually
(1:04:52) can't be a line because you set it up so and stated that this is subjective and
(1:04:59) everything could be considered emotional abuse everything so it's up to subjective interpretation so how could i
(1:05:05) delineate a line so my my example of my my friend being deprived financial
(1:05:13) assets that wasn't emotion that wasn't abuse yeah but i mean interpreted which
(1:05:18) way i think from the man's perspective it's abusive that she overspends she she didn't over she didn't in the case of
(1:05:25) your anecdote all i have to do is offer up a counter anecdote where it was good and then suddenly it's not emotional
(1:05:30) abuse because it's a subjective interpretation do you understand that you're you're you're taking the the you're the way
(1:05:37) that you're thinking is very conte and like all actions are equivalent no matter the circumstances i'm a
(1:05:42) deontologist so that doesn't surprise me uh so all actions are the same no matter
(1:05:49) the situation so for instance deprivation of funds is the same whether that be depriving a woman from food and
(1:05:58) depriving her baby from being fed and that's the same as depriving a woman who just spent that's not what happened in
(1:06:03) your entire life savings on fur coat that is not what you said in your example that their baby was not being
(1:06:09) fed yes i did i did he literally did say that so hang on so you're saying in this
(1:06:14) case that the man is being physically abusive to the child because depriving the child of resources which are
(1:06:20) necessary to life that's different than emotional abuse lauren he's depriving her of funds so if you consider
(1:06:26) depriving her of funds physical abuse it no only in certain circumstances where
(1:06:31) depriving of the funds would stop the child from being fed that's a whole different situation i mean i guess my
(1:06:38) friend could have technically robbed a grocery store and then she wouldn't have deprived the baby from being fed so
(1:06:45) technically it's not his fault right according to you it's not emotional abuse he could just get it she that would be physical abuse you have a duty
(1:06:53) you have an ethical duty to feed your children and if you deprive your children of having food that's an
(1:06:59) entirely different thing but here's the thing let me ask you this i just want to know
(1:07:04) so you're saying that your friend and you're willing to state this on camera that your friend's husband was purposely
(1:07:09) starving their child because you wanted to teach this woman a lesson be because he's an [ __ ] oh mhm i have a feeling
(1:07:17) i have a feeling there's more to the story way could have been of course there's more to the story she's not going to air out their entire lives
(1:07:25) was my friend and she had a husband and her husband would deprive her and her
(1:07:30) baby [ __ ] fun deprivation means no food then that's
(1:07:35) different while she was in college and he was the one working yeah what's up angela yeah okay so let's just bring
(1:07:42) this back i lauren love you but that i don't it's anecdotal i can't really i don't think anyone gets married and just
(1:07:48) becomes an [ __ ] i think these things turn into unless you married an [ __ ] and ignore the red flag she married an [ __ ] so that's her problem and it's
(1:07:54) unfortunate so i want to bring it to andrew i don't think yeah she was just trying to use as yeah i get it as an
(1:08:01) example but like going to andrew you're saying that people should stay together for the sanity of kids but don't you think kids are the byproduct of parents
(1:08:07) if parents don't have a good relationship with each other and the kids stay together with them don't you have [ __ ] up kids to begin with so by
(1:08:12) saying if they're not physically abusing the child or whatever it could be it's still affecting kids and they're still
(1:08:18) going to see parents that are neglecting each other so i understand the argument here the problem with it is that no when
(1:08:25) we see these kind of behavioral elements in society that you would consider to be bad such as you know prostitution uh
(1:08:31) prison all of these different things that all of them tend to stem including homelessness from a single mother not
(1:08:39) from parents who have or children who have two parents in the household he's completely ignoring and what i'm saying
(1:08:45) no i'm not i'm not completely ignoring it i'm not nina nina nobody needs your help nina we don't need your help nina
(1:08:51) let us finish our conversation apparently like you just mumble incoherently while drunk again are you
(1:08:58) going to mumble incoherently while drunk or you going to let us finish our conversation i don't know if that makes
(1:09:03) any sense but like okay so mumbling incoherently can't wait was arguing
(1:09:09) about how parents rub off on their children i think you as a parent know that correct
(1:09:17) yes i agree so that's the basis of her argument is
(1:09:22) it thank you weird that yeah that's why i talking because we're talking about outcomes cuz we're talking about
(1:09:28) outcomes nina so is the outcome outcome i am is the outcome optimal for the
(1:09:35) child even if they're in a home where the the parents don't have an optimal relationship that's what the real
(1:09:41) question is because otherwise why would you break up the family that makes no sense nina do you understand that some
(1:09:48) people are together and they don't have a healthy relationship together so just because a divorce doesn't mean you're still not being a mom or a dad i don't i
(1:09:54) agree i agree not in every single example but if we're looking specifically looking at the outcomes for
(1:10:00) children who have both parents intact in the home even if the parents don't have an optimal relationship the outcomes for
(1:10:06) the children still tend to end up being better and the outcomes for children have always been better outside of
(1:10:13) single motherhood which has skyrocketed since no fault divorce that is not something which is arguable it's just
(1:10:19) true well yeah two parents but um i i mean that that is true that having two
(1:10:25) parents so marriage is for the children it's not for you to go get your man's credit card and go on a shopping spree
(1:10:31) it's for the children so i have a couple of questions do you c would you consider
(1:10:37) like if a woman for instance geometry questions if a woman for instance deprived a man from sex for a
(1:10:45) significant amount of time and cut him off in front of his friends and was like
(1:10:50) clearly being emotionally abusive towards him would that be grounds for divorce
(1:10:56) no i think that he has an obligation and a duty uh beat the [ __ ] out of her
(1:11:02) through you know through his religious convictions to work to work diligently in fixing that marriage first
(1:11:09) and another question if you are emotionally abusing your partner to the
(1:11:15) point in which it's causing them physical stress so for instance their hair falls out or they start cutting
(1:11:21) themselves or they sorry youtube sorry my bad they start doing things that is like physically causing them harm is
(1:11:28) that considered physical abuse now and are is that grounds for divorce you can say whatever you want on my channel this
(1:11:34) would this would depend on if these are coralates or provables so if you can literally go to court and demonstrate my
(1:11:41) hair fell out because all this guy does all day long or you went to the church and demonstrated this my hair literally
(1:11:48) fell out of my head because of all of the verbal abuse and here's the demonstration of this i think the church
(1:11:54) would probably grant you a divorce that would be there is a line for emotional abuse because that's pure emotional
(1:12:00) abuse they're not that so there is a line for emotional abuse may i mean again because it's subjective it's
(1:12:07) always going to be an subjective interpretation for arbitration for it which why i think that having a body of
(1:12:12) a community which are part of arbitrate for you is far superior to having strangers in a court who usually side
(1:12:18) only with one party over the other traditionally but earlier you said there was no line i just said that again i
(1:12:27) literally just said it again you just said there aren't you understanding this there's a physical it doesn't mean that
(1:12:32) the it doesn't mean dude i don't know why you said if the emotional abuse causes your hair to fall out then that's
(1:12:39) enough but earlier you said no i didn't say that i said "i think that a church might grant you a divorce under those
(1:12:44) grounds if you could demonstrate that your hair literally fell out due to the amount of overt verbal abuse that you
(1:12:51) were getting from the other partner." i don't know how you would demonstrate that but if you could i'm sure that they would grant you in that particular
(1:12:58) instance a divorce but that doesn't change the fact that these are interpretations subjective
(1:13:05) interpretations which are done of what you consider to be emotional abuse do you understand all right guys one one
(1:13:11) one minute mark one minute mark so just one more minute for this topic either way whether or not it's the church
(1:13:17) adjudicating it or the state adjudicating it it's a grounds of divorce being emotional abuse
(1:13:24) no well no i think in that case they would they would make a physical argument that this led to physical
(1:13:30) ailments which are detrimental to me and i can demonstrate this through some you know crazy over-the-top means but when
(1:13:37) you're talking when you're talking when you're talking about yes but here's the thing
(1:13:44) so does happy healthy marriages can lead to physical detriments too working 60 hours a week can lead to physical
(1:13:49) detriments if you're doing it on behalf of your family all sorts of things can lead to physical detriments of the body
(1:13:55) you claiming hey it's just emotional abuse which causes these detrimental outcomes is [ __ ] and it's nonsense
(1:14:02) across the board it's a subjective interpretation that you want to utilize in order to push some sort of but what
(1:14:10) if they're abusive in a way that can't be proven that's all it is isn't one of like the biggest factors when it comes
(1:14:17) to male um health detriments and like older age is stress
(1:14:23) yeah but the stress doesn't necessarily come from abuse of your wife it often comes from externalities stress is not a
(1:14:30) physical thing it is a physical thing that then that then causes a physical
(1:14:35) reaction no it can also be a physical thing you can put a lot of stress on your body physically
(1:14:42) i i hate to interrupt but i love this one like way longer it's a juicy debate we can we're going to do like a open
(1:14:48) panel afterwards so you can revisit this topic i actually have a few questions i want to ask myself but i'll wait until
(1:14:53) the debate is over uh so before we move on to the next topic i do want to ask the uh the panel a question uh initially
(1:14:59) i intend this to be pretty balanced like kind of like more of like a threeon three uh would you guys be okay if we
(1:15:05) invite uh rachel andrew's wife on i want to check with everyone on the panel because i didn't clear with any of you
(1:15:12) guys beforehand so if you're not comfortable with that there's no worries i would have a little rejection
(1:15:18) you're cool with it nina of course i love rachel okay cool i just wanted to be fair uh okay andrew why don't you
(1:15:25) just send her the link directly i don't feel like it was unfair but okay i'll send her the link not that it was unfair
(1:15:31) it was like a threeon-one i want to be more balanced ideally yeah i mean it was like unfair when it consent i thought
(1:15:37) listen andrew if you don't want to talk to your wife i understand okay i thought andrew and i would be more on
(1:15:43) the same page i actually kind of expected that too well maybe lauren you
(1:15:48) said your shirt was conservative it show tonight it's like but for
(1:15:55) conservatives and it's very funny it makes fun of andrew fouch yeah i don't
(1:16:00) believe you that it's funny but okay it is funny it is funny it has my friend michael loftess on it uhhuh yeah it's
(1:16:08) good [ __ ] all right rachel how long how long do you need to uh jump on if you can make it in like 30 seconds then
(1:16:14) we'll wait for you if not then we'll yeah i just sent her the link on discord and the problem is is that she doesn't have a camera because i'm using the
(1:16:20) backup cam so we may have to move on anyway she can keep her camera off if she wants to she i mean she just cut you
(1:16:27) that's why no more fun camera budget well okay well we'll get started and she
(1:16:34) can join when she joins um okay so the next topic that we're talking about is a
(1:16:39) woman's body count and the question is what does a woman's body count affect her desiraability as a long-term dating
(1:16:48) and or marriage partner is everyone clear on the proposition can
(1:16:55) you be a little bit more specific about that you're saying does it affect but like what do you mean does it lower her
(1:17:00) value as a potential partner for long-term dating specifically not for
(1:17:06) hookups okay specifically women right specifically for women but you can bring it to analogy uh okay lauren you want to
(1:17:13) kick it off like last time no okay fine let's let uh let's go in
(1:17:19) opposite order let's let angela kick it off um uh do high body counts affect a
(1:17:27) woman's value in the basically the dating market so basically how men view her as far as dating yes from a
(1:17:33) subjective and an objective perspective like meaning like we are talking about men right just to be clear right yeah
(1:17:39) one argument like for example you could say that like well uh some guys could be you know could view that as a negative
(1:17:45) however i personally don't think it's a negative blah blah blah for this reason right sure sure got you more interested in that part rather than because i think
(1:17:52) we can all agree that there's going to be some guys that going to see it as a negative so that's not even that interesting it's more of like what do
(1:17:57) you think do you think it's a negative right so i used to think it was a negative but due to the fact that one in
(1:18:03) three men are virgins or sexist in the past year i can't say you can be picky with who you get to sleep with so we can
(1:18:10) say that it's probably unattractive to them but i wouldn't say they would turn it down and probably realize like it's not that serious after engaging in a
(1:18:16) relationship with that girl uh and that's my stance on that angel but do
(1:18:22) you personally think it's a negative like forget about the man do you personally think it's uh like if you're advising your younger brother or someone
(1:18:28) like that and he was considering a girl with a higher body count would that be something you would warn him against or
(1:18:34) you don't see i would say high so if we say high we're talking about like sex worker high or just like 10 or eight
(1:18:39) nine high like what is high uh well that's up to you to interpret it yeah so i mean i'm going to go bust i'm a pretty
(1:18:46) normal person so i'm a normal person i would say it's not high it's not that serious i don't really know that many
(1:18:51) sex workers so i don't think it's that serious okay cool let's go to oh i think we got
(1:18:58) uh miss mrs mrs andrew wilson that's what she calls herself miss crucible the
(1:19:05) patriarchy the patriarchy wins again okay we'll have you go at the very end uh rachel okay uh nina you're next
(1:19:13) um i would actually think generally having a high body count is probably like a good thing when it comes to like
(1:19:19) you're trying to like [ __ ] cuz like it seems like somebody who knows what they're doing is probably a better partner when it comes to doing any sort
(1:19:26) of sex stuff when it comes to body count in general that can be indicative of a
(1:19:31) lot of different things right like if you have problems having a bonding relationship so therefore you tend to
(1:19:38) just do casual sex not that there's anything wrong with that personally that might you know ne not necessarily be a
(1:19:45) problem but it might be again indicative of some personality's fault but i don't
(1:19:51) think that's necessarily the case and i wouldn't say that's the case in most cases obviously as you get older the uh
(1:19:58) time frame is going to shift i i don't really find it at all a problem
(1:20:03) personally i don't know why it's a problem the only time that i really
(1:20:08) think anyone would think it's a problem if they're just incredibly insecure and it's just about like oh i'm not going to
(1:20:13) be able to be like as good as somebody else and i feel uncomfortable but i i personally think that somebody with
(1:20:19) experience is probably a pretty good thing if you're trying to [ __ ] them i assume i guess where the question goes
(1:20:25) is like are you talking about dating or [ __ ] i don't really know those things your relationships we're not talking about that dating okay so i i think
(1:20:33) that's you know something you could talk about is like okay well then why like well then why do you have like a like have done that like maybe you had like a
(1:20:39) wild spree or whatever or maybe you were a sex worker for a while like or maybe you did porn i mean i guess the same
(1:20:44) thing but uh like the reasons why that you might have a high body count are
(1:20:50) vary significantly depending on um your life experience of course but i don't think it inherently causes any
(1:20:56) particular issue um personally i like the idea of like the loose [ __ ] is
(1:21:01) obvious like complete [ __ ] cuz then it's like if you're going to say that then if you've had a kid then like what
(1:21:07) like you shouldn't like [ __ ] your wife anymore if they have a kid like that would just be like crazy like to think that that like lowers her value because
(1:21:14) she had a kid that's ridiculous um and i i just think that it is a very insecure
(1:21:21) point of view to have to think that like because a woman has [ __ ] a bunch of other people like they are for some reason less than
(1:21:29) i i don't know i've never heard a good argument for it so i'm interested to see what else andrew you're up next the
(1:21:35) answer is yes and that every single body which is added to the count lowers the
(1:21:41) uh value on the marketplace of the woman every single time at least from the
(1:21:47) perspective of the man and the man is the one who ultimately ends up with the woman and generally speaking seemingly
(1:21:54) highquality men seem to want women who have had less sexual partners or no
(1:21:59) sexual partners that seems to be optimal okay uh lauren you're up next
(1:22:06) okay so i try to look up the statistics and it seems like as um i forget what
(1:22:12) year it was but early on women who had 10 bodies or more had lower rates of
(1:22:18) divorce according to these stats however i do have to say there was a mathemat
(1:22:23) and also as time progressed it seems to be more evened out so it it doesn't
(1:22:28) really seem to matter if you have high body count low body count um in fact women with two people as i think it was
(1:22:35) like one or two people as their body count had a very high rate for divorce in comparison however the mathematical
(1:22:41) issue that i found with the data that i looked up was it looked at all of the
(1:22:46) women who got divorced and then pulled them based off how many body counts they had and then broke up that 100% of
(1:22:53) divorced into the women and now that women have more bodies on average that's
(1:22:58) going to change what percentage of women are going to be part of the populace but anyway um so i accord it's hard to look
(1:23:06) at the math but as i'm looking at the math it does not indicate that women with high body counts actually have
(1:23:12) genuinely higher rates of divorce um i've also noticed that the people
(1:23:18) because i've been in these red pill spaces the people who talk most about wanting these women with low body counts
(1:23:25) seem to be attracted to women who do only fans modeling or women who have had
(1:23:31) promiscuous pasts so i don't think these men are being extremely genuine and also
(1:23:36) i have been on several first dates in my life even though i'm not married and i've never been asked on like these
(1:23:43) dates what my body count is um and so i don't really know really when in this
(1:23:49) when in most relationships that conversation happens or if it ever does happen in most relationships so i don't
(1:23:56) even know how men can view women as lesser or better unless they're just guessing her past promiscuity based off
(1:24:03) like i don't know her face like i don't know where men are going to get that information and also women lie so how
(1:24:10) how would you even know like what and then um also i don't know if this low
(1:24:17) body count thing is working out for people like steven crowder for instance his wife had an extremely low body count
(1:24:23) allegedly she was a flipping virgin look how that's going for him now he's a single father of twins um and yeah i'll
(1:24:32) leave it there let me let me just quickly clarify lauren are you talking about the study from institute of family studies is that the one or tell me about
(1:24:38) a different one let me see i had it up um
(1:24:44) yeah yes okay so so that study yeah i did a whole video on that so that study is interesting so basically this is i'm
(1:24:51) not trying to give all debate but this is what the study shows it shows that uh divorce uh i guess whatever percentage
(1:24:57) for virgins is really low then it goes up when you go to one two then it dips
(1:25:02) by a little bit and then when you get past like 9 or 10 it goes starts going up again so it's like zero one two it's
(1:25:10) because it has to do with the age range that those things happen three and then nine so just to clarify for the chat all
(1:25:16) right rachel could go next so sorry i was logging on i really i
(1:25:21) really wanted to do the no fault one darn it maybe we'll revisit that after not that andrew needs my help but i
(1:25:27) thought maybe i could break up the the woman paddle a little bit with something less [ __ ] so uh we're talking about
(1:25:34) body counts and if it matters in the context of marriage is that the thing the the debate proposition is does a
(1:25:42) girl's body count lower her uh desiraability to be a successful long-term dating or marriage partner
(1:25:49) desiraability like from the man's point of view it no it's more i'm looking at
(1:25:55) it from your perspective so meaning like you have a younger brother and he's like "hey i'm dating this girl but her body
(1:26:00) count is like 40 do you think i should marry her that from your perspective do you think that that lowers your value to
(1:26:07) be a good long-term partner that's kind of the the paradigm we're looking at through
(1:26:12) yeah absolutely it does and i would say the reasoning for that is a couple of things number one the higher your body
(1:26:18) count is uh the more likely you are to have been on birth control which alters
(1:26:23) mate selection the more likely you are to have an std we have about a quarter of you know women now having stds is
(1:26:30) higher in some populations and then also um the likelihood of her having had an
(1:26:36) abortion would be higher um things like that and then the higher your body count
(1:26:41) is um we would hope you're older but if you're younger with a higher body count
(1:26:46) you're probably going to have trouble pair bonding it's probably a red flag uh for you know probably growing up in a
(1:26:51) fatherless home being a child of divorce and if you grew up with a single mom you're probably more likely to have
(1:26:57) dysfunction in your relationships and get divorced so if i were a man or if it
(1:27:02) was a man i cared about no i would not want a chick with a high body count so just to just to quickly add uh since
(1:27:09) i intervened on the other side so rachel is not too far off it's not one out of four it's one out of five people
(1:27:14) currently have an std but anyway small difference anyway all right cool open panel it's people or is it just women
(1:27:21) it's just said women people in general for so there's no differential okay i
(1:27:27) have to look you know if women have a lower rate of std versus men i'm looking it up i'll look it up also i have a
(1:27:34) question if this woman has an exceedingly high body count but she's never been on birth control she's never
(1:27:40) had an std and she's never had an abortion does that change your mind at all about this how on earth how on earth
(1:27:46) would you have a really high body count but never have had kids or had an abortion if you're a really easy answer
(1:27:54) in a really easy answer you could do porn and in porn they do a lot of std checking like a lot of std checking so
(1:28:01) she could be extremely careful and then she could also be timing her um
(1:28:07) abortions they do you think that do you think that high quality men want to marry chicks who've done porn lauren
(1:28:12) okay are you [ __ ] serious you have any idea the amount of like men that are
(1:28:18) just like psychotically obsessed with porn stars into porn let's say she was just really
(1:28:24) anal about checking all of her partners beforehand and shear when you're both
(1:28:30) harping like that can one i have stopped talking i'm sorry that you're lagging but let's not can with that let's just
(1:28:38) work with what we we got to do okay you mentioned two two times now that you
(1:28:43) don't like women so i don't understand the internal hate we don't have to get into that we don't get into that no no
(1:28:48) no let's stay focused i didn't say i don't like women you just harping that's because you're harping that has nothing
(1:28:55) to do with whether or not she likes women or not i agree with nina nina's making the most sense right now let's stay focused okay so if there was a
(1:29:02) woman who had maybe an extremely high body count however she never had an std
(1:29:08) she never had an abortion and she's never been on birth control how would you feel about this person okay i'll
(1:29:14) tell that's a great question i'll tell you how i feel i would say you should marry her because she's a literal
(1:29:20) unicorn and she probably has magic powers um so i would say in that case if
(1:29:26) if you found a magical unicorn porn star with a high body count who's never been on birth control never had an abortion
(1:29:32) doesn't have an std and somehow avoided pregnancy she probably has witch magic
(1:29:38) some kind of unicorn magic power so i'd say go for it no she has access to [ __ ] planned parenthood do you not
(1:29:44) know how std of abortions you mean where abortions at birth control
(1:29:49) are one second wait hang on one second one second rachel you're lagging really badly let's turn your camera just turn
(1:29:56) off your camera just turn off your camera yeah just turn off your camera so
(1:30:01) first of all planned parenthood does other things besides no no no you still have to no rachel you still have to have
(1:30:06) she'll come back in give her a second okay there we go all right hello so you
(1:30:11) wouldn't have to be a unicorn you could be a person who understands how to test whether or not you're ovulating because
(1:30:17) they do have ovulation tests they also have the um ability to prevent so that
(1:30:23) would prevent the abortions that would and then you could also do std testing that would prevent stds and then you
(1:30:28) wouldn't need birth control these are outliers these are incredible outliers lauren
(1:30:34) question she's answering isolating variables so yes and if if you're
(1:30:39) isolating the to only get us to outliers it's worthless no because i'm asking
(1:30:44) about the high body count so if the issue is women with st it's not that's not just the issue if the issue is or if
(1:30:51) the issue is women who get abortions that's another issue however you're saying high body count is the issue so
(1:30:57) i'm wondering if you isolate high body count just that specific variable the
(1:31:02) answer would still be no so the answer would still be that even then because of virtue so men tend to look especially
(1:31:10) high quality men for virtues in women the same types of virtues you're looking for in men so what are the virtues that
(1:31:16) you're looking for in men like can you explain what you mean yes i am you have to be quiet though as i explain what the virtues are yeah i was done talking go
(1:31:22) ahead yeah great so the first one virtue would probably be something like loyalty
(1:31:27) i would guess you would not want your spouse spouse to be running around with other other people right that would be
(1:31:33) one of my guesses you'd want somebody who had temperance you'd want somebody who follows what does temperance mean
(1:31:39) even killed self-control mhm they have self-control they're even okay what does that mean in like a practical like
(1:31:45) day-to-day sense imprint they're not impulsive they don't just pop off and do crazy [ __ ] right they're even
(1:31:53) killed do you need that explained honestly we can't explain it if you need
(1:31:59) us to but i think you know what it means right no so even killed means not yeah
(1:32:04) exactly not impulsive uh doesn't go crazy very predictable right things like
(1:32:10) this those are the types of attributes that most people look for in a partner they're not looking people want boring
(1:32:17) people that doesn't seem like that's a very boring you think that that's boring just the way you're describing it makes
(1:32:23) it seem like it's [ __ ] boring not to be crazy like being spontaneous and rational and having emotional control is
(1:32:31) boring okay we don't have to get we don't have to get caught up in this we need a porn star otherwise life is boring it's just ridiculous you just
(1:32:38) okay so what what are your other what are your other things we don't have to get caught up in this
(1:32:44) is that it those are just well no that's not it there's many other virtues and
(1:32:51) when you're looking at virtues if you'd like me to give you a list of the cardinal virtues i can do so but these
(1:32:57) are me too why are you not giving me the rest of that i literally am pulling them up so that i can i'll read them off to
(1:33:03) you so that you have them so you could be a non-impulsive person in fact it would take a pretty non-impulsive person
(1:33:10) to wait for std testing and to do ovelation tests and to make sure that you're wearing a yes but chastity is
(1:33:16) also a virtue why every why do you always interrupt me well because i wasn't done talking first of all i was
(1:33:23) talking you interrupted me oh my god you guys keep doing this so anyway chastity chastity is another one of the virtues
(1:33:29) so if you're looking at women who have chastity especially this is why virginity is so prized in society
(1:33:35) especially as we have that should apply to both right especially as we have very few virgins and yes it does do you think
(1:33:42) that a virginal woman should uh marry a man that's been kind of slutting it up as
(1:33:49) say here's a really simple way to to frame this okay i'm realizing i'm derailing i'm sorry let's stay focused
(1:33:55) i'm sorry so if you're looking at if you're looking at chastity between both of them
(1:34:00) there's a reason that lauren just stated when you have two people who are virgins who get married they actually tend to stay married a lot longer sure but let's
(1:34:07) go yes it is true that's not okay read it crowder crowder is a perfect example
(1:34:15) and when they got married the statistics just don't show that to be true even over time in fact the highest divorce
(1:34:22) when when divorces were first legal the highest the people who first get divorced like in the biggest numbers
(1:34:29) were people who were buried as virgins your study everyone was your study that
(1:34:35) you just cited the one of the first things that you said was that people with a low body count tend to stay
(1:34:42) married longer that's what you literally just said is your opening yes you did then read it read your study focus it it
(1:34:50) as totally temporous in chest that's later hang on hang on there's there's an aberration i'm not even talking about
(1:34:57) the aberration though i'm just saying that if you have people who are religious and chased and have a low body
(1:35:02) count who get married tend to stay married longer that's in the data that you're looking at right now no it's not
(1:35:09) then then read the data over time too yes it changes over time with body count
(1:35:14) that's true but if you're younger in your virgin yes you do tend to stay together for longer periods of time so
(1:35:21) the divorce history there like when no fault divorces became available in us
(1:35:28) history there was different like the rates of which people got divorced and their body counts have shifted over time
(1:35:34) and that's shifted with culture yes because i have a question i have a question let her finish let her finish
(1:35:40) go ahead i have a question when did you have the conversation ra and rachel you can answer this rachel andrew when did
(1:35:47) you guys have the conversation about each other's body counts before you got married if you guys don't want to answer that that's fine too i don't want to do
(1:35:54) anecdotal stuff and here's why this is really you've been talking forever let
(1:36:00) me talk chill out chill out chill out well i got to listen she'll just talk forever
(1:36:06) unless i say something so here hang on you guys all talk forever okay let let
(1:36:12) it we're all debaters we all talk you guys don't want to answer ask me a question let let her rephrase the
(1:36:18) question then you can answer it go ahead when did you have that conversation
(1:36:23) i'm not going to talk about my personal life in a debate here's how you have that conversation here's how you can
(1:36:30) understand it the reason men value a low body count in women is because it means she's valuable she doesn't just give
(1:36:36) herself away to anyone it's the same reason it's the same reason women don't value simps because how does a man do
(1:36:44) whatever you want let her finish now let her finish so the reason men don't want
(1:36:50) [ __ ] is because the same reason women don't want simps if you're that easy to get nobody wants you it's that simple
(1:36:57) you don't have to know a woman's body count well you could probably get to know her
(1:37:04) and know if she's had 50 other dudes before you you'd probably be able to tell from reputation only fans all sorts
(1:37:11) of different things what what no that that's so not true is
(1:37:17) that not true never had that conversation is what i'm gathering i never first of
(1:37:22) all like we've never why why is it let me ask you a question how many sexual
(1:37:28) partners have you had how many dicks have you sucked lauren zero mhm so you're lying no yes uh-huh yes you're
(1:37:36) lying so that's so here's the thing that rude are you serious well i mean if you're going to
(1:37:42) ask us say this is proof women can lie she's going to say i'm lying because it's proof women can lie about it she
(1:37:49) didn't say the same thing she didn't say she didn't say you were lying the same thing does okay i like
(1:37:56) you a lot more rachel we could be friends no we can't we absolutely cannot because the sound of your voice is like
(1:38:02) nails on a chalkboard you realize you guys sound exactly the same right
(1:38:08) no because i don't talk like this
(1:38:13) you literally sound exactly the same no we don't
(1:38:21) are you serious right now i can do i can do a nita impression do
(1:38:27) you want to hear my nita impression yes i would love to i love you then
(1:38:35) alex impression can you do an alex impression no but i can i do a really good alex
(1:38:41) impression yeah this is
(1:38:46) alex with fire embodyment of just curly face oh yeah he's going to do like the
(1:38:51) drinking out of this i do the side thing although i feel like you got my voice wrong you guys do you got to do it with
(1:38:56) an insanely deep voice what's up guys this is alex from playing with five [ __ ] 20 no i know you want to sound i
(1:39:03) know you want to sound like that but you you don't you sound like slightly confused like hey this is alex and today
(1:39:10) i'm going to teach you how to get a chick's phone number sometimes and it works 80% of the time sometimes i assure
(1:39:17) you andrew i am definitely not confused all right let's get back to the initial proposition okay yeah she reminds me of
(1:39:23) just pearly things like almost to a tea but anyway i don't think that you would
(1:39:30) be able to know a woman's body count unless she told it to you and she was honest so your whole thing about valuing
(1:39:36) a woman based off her body count and then also you mentioned pair bonding which is like the weakest there's
(1:39:42) literally no science there's correlation causation which you should know is not uh justifiable in the scientific mind
(1:39:50) but it's just as justifiable as your definition of emotional abuse which is
(1:39:56) nonsense bro what like what is a scientific
(1:40:01) you're trying to say care bonding is a scientific thing that happens due to no i'm saying it's you can bring up
(1:40:08) emotional abuse you have no more support for emotional abuse than i would prepare
(1:40:13) bonding because emotional abuse is a thing now you can argue about what level
(1:40:18) of emotional abuse is justified for a divorce that's a subjective issue for
(1:40:24) but you're saying pair bonding it wasn't five minutes ago exist and pair bonding is a true thing whereas pair bonding
(1:40:30) implies that there's some sort of a chemical issue that in which you have sex with it it doesn't have to be
(1:40:36) chemical as well it doesn't have to yeah it doesn't have to be chemical i didn't say it was chemical as well which is
(1:40:42) where it doesn't matter what you said you said pair bonding pair bonding that is the that is the discussion that's not
(1:40:49) strictly chemical it's not a strictly chemical phenomenon it's a psychological emotional
(1:40:56) phenomenon as well just like emotional abuse sure sure sure okay okay phenomenon that doesn't exist keep us on
(1:41:01) the trails a little bit we're talking about pair bonding here no it does it does it does exist scientifically what do you let's let's go into that let's
(1:41:08) talk about pair bonding here what aspect of pair bonding is taken away from with a higher body count like how do you get
(1:41:15) the pair if it's emotionally based and like what does it have to do with like physical i'll tell you so it used to be
(1:41:21) that this was this was argued from an oxytocin perspective but they recently did studies on vos where they saw that
(1:41:28) the vos would still pair bond even absent the oxytocin meaning that there must be some sort of emotional response
(1:41:35) a physiological response which happens even when oxytocin is taken out of the equation so what rachel is saying to you
(1:41:41) is even if this is not purely chemical due to the science and i can send you
(1:41:47) the v study if you want to see it i know because i prepped for this debate on pair bonding tomorrow on this channel
(1:41:53) right okay what you're going to find out is hey there's also emotional bonding which happens even inside of animals
(1:41:59) which are close cousins and in this case from a biological sense they're stating the scientists are that these are at
(1:42:04) least the closest thing that we can find who pair bond so there's an emotional status to this as well as a chemical
(1:42:11) status of oxytocin it's not just a one a one sleeve fits all type of thing but to
(1:42:16) say it's unscientific or it's not study is insane because it is say that i'm asking you to no but lauren did say that
(1:42:21) she said it's totally unscientific and it's not totally unscientific is it lauren it is it is totally so so did i
(1:42:27) just give you literal scientific data would you like for me to send you the study right now yeah i i've already read
(1:42:34) the study and the sc and the study is based off causation correlation principles and is totally you've read
(1:42:39) the study what's the animal what's the animal again in the in the study what animal are they studying shut up dina
(1:42:46) what is the animal they're studying a v let us finish our conversation you don't
(1:42:52) have to play captain savo every five minutes now lauren lauren why did they use vos in the study
(1:43:00) um because they're similar to humans in terms of vos are similar to humans i
(1:43:06) don't in terms of chemical and also because they're cheap rodent type animals used in a lot of studies so you
(1:43:12) don't know why they were used specifically why do you what do we use we use those in a lot of scientific studies why did they use fools for this
(1:43:18) scientific study that you read answer the question instead of asking her question shut up nina answer
(1:43:29) answer the question i want the question answered nina not your paddling lauren why did they use it
(1:43:35) up while you're doing this nina lauren answer my question answer why don't you
(1:43:41) give me the answer no i want you to answer because you read the study you just got done saying "yeah i don't know why did they use vs what why did they
(1:43:49) use vos i don't know i don't recall right you don't know you don't know the primary reason for the study which you
(1:43:55) cited because you know bond for life that's why so you're hold on that
(1:44:01) doesn't make any sense most important part of the study that literally makes no sense so you're saying that they did
(1:44:08) a scientific study to prove pair bonding existed animal in which they knew that
(1:44:13) pair bond they pair bonded that would be so circular that makes circular let me
(1:44:18) tell you why because they were looking at the oxytocin uh portion here and the
(1:44:24) oxytocin when they pulled the oxytocin out of the animal they still pair bonded so they're trying to equate this to
(1:44:30) humans to say maybe it's not oxytocin or a chemical reaction that leads to the pair bonding of human beings your your
(1:44:38) your argument is circular and not that's not necessarily it's a study it's a study
(1:44:44) not the likely reason that they actually use the vo is because it's the most common animal used in no it's because
(1:44:51) they pair bond for life that's why and they wanted to see if they would continue after they removed the oxytocin
(1:44:58) yes that's why they it literally says in the study that's why they used them you lunatic
(1:45:04) holy [ __ ] you're crazy you're a crazy hang andrew maybe you can link
(1:45:10) this video in the private chat just so they can take a look at angela has been uh trying to speak for
(1:45:16) like 20 minutes let's just let her get away sorry go ahead you're good so wait so you guys are saying people high body
(1:45:22) counts basically aren't really shipping to her what is a high body count to you question
(1:45:27) are you asking me yeah i think she's asking yeah so i would so for me i think that it's actually easier to reduce it
(1:45:34) to this to just say that every additional person that a woman has slept with in the eyes of men likely lowers
(1:45:42) her value to most men that's the way that i would frame it so giving it like
(1:45:47) an arbitrary number without system and just saying something like well maybe it's nine maybe it's eight maybe it's
(1:45:53) seven factor i don't know that we would all agree that that's true but i think that most men would agree that the more
(1:45:58) that we add the worse that it is andrew it's it's looking the question is intend
(1:46:03) to look at it from your perspective so imagine your son when he gets older comes to you and says "hey dad you know
(1:46:08) this girl i'm dating has a body count of whatever is that too high?" that's kind of what the question is designed to uh
(1:46:14) probe wow yeah well i understand but i think that that question in and of
(1:46:19) itself the the reason that he's coming to me to even ask the question to begin with is because he would think that x
(1:46:26) amount of people that this chick has slept with is a red flag to begin with that's the point that i'm making so
(1:46:32) reduce it i would say that every the well the red flag is that you're promiscuous and promiscuous women have
(1:46:37) less trust what go i have a question if virgins are so desirable why aren't men
(1:46:43) just going like straight to churches and finding the most in mass
(1:46:49) i i promise you men are going to the clubs to find women listen listen they're going the the amount of young
(1:46:56) men which has skyrocketed inside of uh even what you would consider to be obscure churches in the united states
(1:47:03) like orthodoxy for instance which has skyrocketed in membership is due to younger men looking don't lie you know
(1:47:10) the statistics shut up we're going to church am i going to be allowed to answer a question without you interrupting i just
(1:47:17) wanted to say my piece go ahead god this chick never never stops talking go ahead so one more so one more time i'm going
(1:47:23) to explain this to you in more traditional churches memberships are shooting up through the roof now what
(1:47:28) nah is trying to counter is wait a second there's actually been a reduction of x and that's not true there has not
(1:47:35) been a reduction of x of orthodoxy in the united states it shot through the roof catholicism and catholicism is also
(1:47:42) on the rise for younger men and you see this specifically because they're trying to have a return to tra tradition yeah
(1:47:48) it is true whether you shake your head or not been hemorrhaging since especially since co uh maybe it is i
(1:47:54) have to ask you andrew do you think that rachel is worth less after you [ __ ] her
(1:48:01) uh dude why are you asking me these private that is a fair question don't
(1:48:07) you [ __ ] act like it isn't i think i think that you're worthless cuz you have an only fans nina that's what i think do
(1:48:13) you that's not answering my question yeah i'm not going to answer your personal questions and when you bring one up i'll just shoot a personal one
(1:48:20) back do you think that it's not a personal question i'm saying it's she's
(1:48:25) not worth less to me i mean what is a personal question but i think she'd be worth less to somebody else
(1:48:31) you think that she is worth less to somebody else i think that from a man's perspective that she would be worth less
(1:48:38) to other men i didn't think it was i didn't think it was trying to be offensive i was just asking the question you were just asking the question how
(1:48:44) many times have have people paid you have people paid you to do private only fans systems forum nina i don't think
(1:48:50) you understand anything about my wait how do you know i have an only fans dude like i don't for twitter post i no i
(1:48:57) don't you were just you were looking for that [ __ ] if you found it not it's not
(1:49:03) that other people post your [ __ ] my only friends in like two years as much
(1:49:10) as question but then andrew and rachel can't answer a basic question which
(1:49:18) answer others bodies count yeah again i'll i'll answer that
(1:49:24) question lauren i think it's fair as soon as you told me how many dicks you sucked zero and you're not lying about this how
(1:49:31) would i determine never sucked a dick and how would i determine that you're not lying exactly andrew so your point
(1:49:38) your point right so your point here for the question is to determine that with
(1:49:43) that you can lie because it's not disputed andrew i don't think that you're lying because i think you're lying right now right like this is kind
(1:49:50) of bad faith here you really understand that like i think that we're living in a in or we're having a conversation where
(1:49:57) i trust what you're saying like and i assume everyone else does why do you think that she's lying well so again i
(1:50:05) think that the purpose i think that the purpose the purpose of her demonstration
(1:50:10) of saying "hey how would you ever make that determination based on the amount of information that i've that you've
(1:50:15) given me right now i couldn't but that doesn't mean that if i was dating you or somebody else was for god's sakes that
(1:50:22) they could not investigate to make a determination as to whether or not you slept with other men that's just the
(1:50:27) most ridiculous thing i've ever heard lauren to be honest it's just ridiculous saying that you can value women and add
(1:50:33) value to them and subtract value to them based off their body count a number that you could only really ever get by asking
(1:50:40) a woman and then you no you don't just get it by asking a woman that's a straw man virgin and you assume that she's a
(1:50:46) liar that's a straw man so i've given you multiple ways that men will investigate women to determine i don't
(1:50:52) have an only fans i don't that's nice i'm not dating you lauren so like what's your point the point you're your point
(1:50:58) the point is you gave multiple ways in which you could determine a woman's high body count one of the ways was only fans
(1:51:04) and all of the various yeah but you would have to be interested in the woman so if you're dating the woman i think
(1:51:09) that most men would probably want to know how many uh dudes the chick has slept with that seems to be pretty
(1:51:15) common interested in me and they looked into me by looking up my what history or
(1:51:21) whatever they would be not able to see what my body count is because i don't post i so you'd have to assume i'm a
(1:51:28) virgin i guess because i don't post about my sexual escapades and i don't have an only thing so you go out on a so
(1:51:34) you go out on a date with a guy and he says do you have an ex-boyfriend and you're like yeah i've x amount of
(1:51:40) ex-boyfriends right or this type of thing well so if you're appear as the
(1:51:45) driven snow when he investigates then fine he's not going to meet your family
(1:51:51) he's not going to meet your parents what about this what is this argument what is this of a guy that angela talk okay so a
(1:51:59) guy that's dated maybe two girls for like within the past like eight years and he dates the third girl and the girls probably had five boyfriends or
(1:52:06) five bodies is that a deal breaker from because we can't really break this down so it would that's going to be more than
(1:52:12) him so you're saying men wouldn't value that so i don't think that it's necessarily a deal breakaker right i
(1:52:20) think that all i'm saying is that if the man is presented let's say all things equal across the board let me just ask
(1:52:26) you guys this question all things equal across the board so it's the same guy or same guy basically and same exact woman
(1:52:34) essentially okay they have the choice if they can pick the same version of this woman who's [ __ ] five dudes or the
(1:52:41) same version of this woman who's [ __ ] no dudes which woman do you think that they would pick all things equal
(1:52:47) well i mean i think i mean would you not want someone with experience like i would think they answer my question just
(1:52:53) answer the question don't ask me a question answer me a question i think i think many men would go for the non
(1:52:59) virgin i do i genuinely do i think maybe a majority
(1:53:05) worst cope i've ever heard choose a virgin let me let me ask alex let me ask
(1:53:10) the same question piece of [ __ ] cope andrew and when you ask us a question and when we answer it honestly you say
(1:53:16) that we're you didn't answer you asked me a question coping have you no you asked me a question no i said like i
(1:53:23) answered your question andrew have you heard of cucking have you heard of this concept of cucks in fact there's a wide
(1:53:31) variety of men in in the united states around the world who enjoy watching women get [ __ ] and then sometimes want
(1:53:38) to [ __ ] those women afterwards because they're cucks in fact they they prefer women would you date one of them higher
(1:53:44) body hair would you date one of those cucks would you date one lauren would you date a cuck maybe maybe you would if
(1:53:52) he was like a super nice guy and he said "listen i just want to watch my best friend [ __ ] you and then i can do so
(1:53:57) afterwards." you would be cool with that right into [ __ ] them and like no i'm just asking lauren remember there's a
(1:54:03) high degree of cucks she maybe would date one can you tell me the criteria in which you would maybe date a cuck lauren i can't wait to hear it
(1:54:10) i fell in love with somebody and um he wants you to get railed by his best friend that's fine with you look i'm not
(1:54:16) really i don't i don't have i don't do pro promiscuity myself that's not my thing oh okay gotcha just it's just for
(1:54:23) everybody else who would find that enjoyable who would like who like the idea of getting [ __ ] by multiple guys
(1:54:29) yeah okay i want you to do this close your eyes and tell me one woman you know who likes that go ahead look there's
(1:54:36) this person that i open that one right so i think in the scenario i gave you was a little bit more realistic but when
(1:54:42) you created the hypothetic of all things equal across the board like i understand like obviously that sounds amazing on
(1:54:47) paper but it's just not realistic being that it's easier for women to at least engage into hookup culture or get sex so
(1:54:54) we're talking about the realities of a guy who probably only dated one or two girls versus a girl who probably dated five guys uh that's five bodies so
(1:55:01) you're saying to go back she's not valuable she's dated five guys lena the
(1:55:07) plug thank you chat no i don't i don't i don't think so i don't necessarily think that's a dealbreaker for every guy so
(1:55:14) you've got hundreds of millions of people there's obviously going to be room for these dynamics the point of the
(1:55:20) hypothetical is just to demonstrate this that if all things are equal and you think a man had to pick with the it's
(1:55:26) the same exact woman but he gets the same exact woman untouched by other men or he gets the same exact woman after
(1:55:32) she's had many sexual partners which one do you think he would prefer i think that most i think that most reasonable
(1:55:39) people can intuit it he would prefer the one who is untouched by other men how do
(1:55:44) you do you think that that's incorrect is the question we should clarify well wait i think we
(1:55:50) should clarify andrew when you say a lot of men like what range are you thinking of because that could be you know
(1:55:55) subjective based on the person are you thinking 10 50 100 500 like what's what's a ballpark
(1:56:01) i again i i think that just every time you add one it's worse than before but
(1:56:06) you're posing a question i can't give you a definitive deal breaker for every man that's
(1:56:12) impossible of what you mean when you say a lot of men i again it's an it's an
(1:56:17) arbitrary metric yes exactly just a ballpark i agree
(1:56:25) so so try to understand you're missing the point the point isn't whether or not it's arbitrary that's my question no
(1:56:31) hang on the point isn't whether or not it's an arbitrary system i've already conceded that it's arbitrary what we're
(1:56:37) trying to do now is just determine intuitively what do you think that most men would prefer and that will give us
(1:56:43) an idea as to why it is that men kind of would prefer to have a lower body count
(1:56:49) even if they can't tell you specifically why that is let me explain andrew why wait wait let me just clarify this let
(1:56:55) me explain why i'm asking the question because i think earlier you mentioned let's ask alex and then you guys change
(1:57:00) gears but if so if you if you give me a a hypothetical the girl is a virgin or
(1:57:06) she's been with a hund bodies i would say i'll take the virgin but if you give me a hypothetical where it's like a
(1:57:11) girl's a virgin or she's been with five guys i'll take the girl that's not a virgin i'll take the girl that's been with five guys so it does m just because
(1:57:18) i don't want a girl who's a virgin because of preference right but there's no but here's the thing do you think do
(1:57:24) you think most men would intuitit that yeah yeah do you think most men would want their dick sucked by a woman who's
(1:57:30) never sucked a dick or a woman well i don't want to get involved today okay we
(1:57:35) don't have to do that did you guys think that after steven crowder's situation you think he's going to get another virgin you think he's going to pick
(1:57:40) someone who has experience i doubt he's going to get another virgin there's most women aren't virgins right so that's no
(1:57:46) it's not that i would just say like after dealing with a virgin and realizing like how much of a down no it is that i think that if if if he had his
(1:57:53) choice of the of the woman of the woman that he fell in love with whoever that
(1:57:58) is right and he could have her by other men or have her while she's been touched
(1:58:04) by other men he would intuit it out if he was given that choice he would prefer her to not have been touched by other
(1:58:09) men that's what i think i think it still never answered you still never answered
(1:58:15) my question i answered your questions about how many dicks have been in my mouth now can you tell me when you had the conversation with your wife about
(1:58:22) your body each other's body counts we've been married for 18 years i couldn't even tell you did you have that
(1:58:28) conversation yeah did you not have the conversation at all very early of course we had the conversation everybody does
(1:58:35) no not everybody does yeah i think everybody does at some point i really do i've never been in a relationship where
(1:58:41) we haven't had the conversation ever in my life we've been in you guys have been married for a long time right yeah i've been
(1:58:47) married for a long time but i'm an old man how many relationships have you been in well now you're just how many more
(1:58:53) personal questions would you like to have how many relationship you don't have to you don't have to answer anything and how many of them were sexual you asked me earlier how many
(1:59:00) boyfriends and you lied because and you have no liver boyfriends
(1:59:10) so you remember that you this into the personal domain first you brought it
(1:59:15) into the personal domain first not us no okay i have a question for you girls i
(1:59:20) have a question do you guys think that do you guys think that body count affects the reliability of a man's like
(1:59:29) assurance of his paternity of his children in other words if he married a woman who slept with 25 guys versus a
(1:59:36) woman who slept with three guys who do you think he's going to be more secure in the paternity of his children with
(1:59:43) and do you think that hold on if she slept with 25 guys like over the
(1:59:51) course of years only slept with him n months before the baby came out versus a
(1:59:57) girl who slept with three different dudes around 9 months the baby came out
(2:00:02) no i mean i mean you're looking for a woman to marry who you want to have
(2:00:07) children with okay and girl a has slept with 25 guys and girl b has slept with
(2:00:13) three guys and the guy is going "hm i feel like with girl b i can be more
(2:00:18) certain that the children are going to be mine i feel like she's probably not going to so you're quitting body or i'm
(2:00:27) asking if you guys think that it's related you're i actually would be more concerned with the person who has lower
(2:00:33) body count i guess if i had to pick i think that's a silly argument but if i had to pick also a prostitute so i mean
(2:00:40) that's this is you're like oh personal attacking for drinking if you
(2:00:48) have if you only fans she's a prostitute i'm sorry and you've been attacking her for her only
(2:00:57) fans what do you mean like she's just mad because you stopped posting nina why
(2:01:02) are you hang upset that she's a prostitute a prostitute is prostitute
(2:01:07) did do you understand i only did lwds right you put on instagram you don't know what
(2:01:14) you don't understand what a lwd photo is no i was never naked in any of my photos that i put on uh only fans you were just
(2:01:21) selling your flesh for money right no i just was taking pictures what do you mean no yes that's my flesh
(2:01:30) who are you do you think that the exact same capitalism hang on stop stop are
(2:01:35) you serious stop are you saying that you did not post pictures to your only fans
(2:01:41) that you thought were going to make men sexually gratify themselves is that what you're really claiming not really not
(2:01:49) really what i just posted some pictures i thought it looked cool and and i thought it looked hot like whatever like
(2:01:55) how many females how many females were buying those pictures does it matter what it would matter yeah the men are
(2:02:02) buying them because men want to see the pictures and that's why they're buying them okay makes you a prostitute who is your
(2:02:09) audience andrew who what is your audience what what is the demographic of your audience 96% male same really seems
(2:02:18) like you're being a little bit of a [ __ ] then huh for the male gays no how does that follow facts nina oh
(2:02:27) yeah people that want dudes wow these are so smart do you think that they're
(2:02:33) sexually pleasuring themselves to be da what the hell what what kind of argument is this they don't you're a handsome guy
(2:02:40) you are selling you're selling pictures of yourself luds or nudes or whatever
(2:02:45) because and men are buying them because it's sexually gratifying you know that that's why it's being done that's
(2:02:52) prostitution i don't know why you'd be upset with me for pointing that out i i'm not i just think it's really silly
(2:02:59) that's yeah i think you're being you guys all seem pretty upset 5 seconds ago even though i didn't say anything wrong
(2:03:04) you can tell this is this is the face of somebody who's really upset yeah we're so upset we're going around calling people drunkards and [ __ ] and stuff
(2:03:11) and talking about i didn't call her a [ __ ] i said she was a prostitute i mean if i'm a [ __ ] you are and you're a
(2:03:17) prostitute too it's just it's online [ __ ] like you're selling your entire like people watch your show because they
(2:03:23) like you it's your persona exactly so it's like go to watch that's so ridiculous wait
(2:03:31) you honestly think that there aren't some people who probably jerk off to [ __ ] rachel like are you serious right now yeah but her object there's
(2:03:37) not but here's the thing here's the thing rachel stop it don't sell yourself so short even even if that's true that's
(2:03:44) not the purpose of what she's attempting to do and that is the purpose of what you're attempting to do that's a distinction between intent which is
(2:03:51) what again andrew i have not posted on that [ __ ] in two years all it was was i
(2:03:58) don't advert i don't advertise it at all if you want to call me that i guess you can but i feel like it's very silly and
(2:04:05) it's like much of a cope on your end okay so i'll correct i'll correct former prostitute
(2:04:13) my bad coming to these ad homonym attacks just
(2:04:18) shows that you're oh yeah we started those we started those not you guys you did start those i mean when did when did
(2:04:24) i say anything bad i love rachel i love you you know we're we're besties so like i don't the whole purpose of you guys
(2:04:31) [ __ ] but nah hasn't been [ __ ] at all the purpose and the attempt of trying to dive into our personal life and personal
(2:04:37) dynamics we just asked a question and we said if you were uncomfortable you don't have to answer it yeah and we and here's
(2:04:43) the thing at first on her personal [ __ ] no i didn't yeah over her you literally called me over you had not asked anybody
(2:04:49) on this panel a personal question till one was asked of us promise you can play the video back so somebody else asked a
(2:04:56) personal question and then you can ask a personal question of anybody else on the panel it doesn't really i mean here if it's good for the goose it's good for
(2:05:02) the gander if you're going to dive in let's get back on the body count and we get off the personal i will say nina has
(2:05:09) always been pretty respectful to me so i'm not going to go that hard no i love you rachel
(2:05:15) thanks nina i love you too oh that was a very touching moment it
(2:05:20) was so do you guys think that a chick can have a sky high body count and it just
(2:05:27) has no effect on her ability to be a good mother and a good wife it just totally doesn't matter i think you need
(2:05:33) to prove why that would become a problem i think there can be issues like you pointed out like earlier about like
(2:05:40) maybe she has an std or maybe she's done
(2:05:46) uh like i personally don't think i would need to see the data again about
(2:05:51) abortions and the ability to have further children because i've heard mixed issues on that um how so if h not
(2:05:58) having an abortion in the past is important to you and also i'm pro-life so that could be important to me as well
(2:06:04) statistically lauren on that one just to really quick i'm sorry if i'm like dabing a little bit um it's generally
(2:06:10) the stat the statistics are the same of having a child um if not less so yes
(2:06:16) there are a more health risk when you have an abortion but it's the same that you would if you were to carry out a
(2:06:22) pregnancy so kind of a wash on that one so i understand that part but but those
(2:06:30) are just you're saying it's statistically more likely to happen if she has a high body count but if you're isolating the variable of high body
(2:06:36) count i don't necessarily think that that would prevent her from being a good mother um and i also think that there
(2:06:43) are things that you could benefit from having a high like you have a benefit of experience and of maybe warning your
(2:06:49) kids about the dangers of promiscuity and so you there's therap beneficial actually you know i always think that's
(2:06:55) a really bizarre argument because i'm just wondering what y'all are doing in the bedroom that you think you need to
(2:07:02) go through like 20 or 30 dudes to figure it out it's pretty simple there's only a
(2:07:07) few parts and they can only be put together in so many ways like why you need to
(2:07:16) i don't understand your how how never mind okay can you explain your argument
(2:07:21) every like i'm sorry go a little bit no rachel it's
(2:07:26) like so you're saying these extremes like a really high body count and this is why i hate these conversations
(2:07:32) because it's like i i'm think i'm pretty normal so i'm going to say just an average body count whatever an average girl is but if we're talking about like
(2:07:38) sex workers or like people that are like in the porn industry i'm assuming they're always going to date somebody that they work with are in the same
(2:07:44) industry they're never just going to go date like a regular average guy who doesn't really who isn't exposed to this lifestyle or maybe like having multiple
(2:07:50) partners so i just go ahead okay well i'm sorry i didn't mean to cut you off actually angela's been angela's been
(2:07:56) decent the entire panel but uh angela i i just just did want to point this out though there is a post uh porn industry
(2:08:05) for most of these women right so they're not in they're only in porn when they're viable to be in porn and that's usually
(2:08:11) when they're younger and prettier right they're not usually they're not they're not usually rolling porn into their 40s
(2:08:18) 50s 60s this and that when they do leave when they do leave that industry it is true so when they do leave that industry
(2:08:24) uh there is a shelf life for porn workers have you heard of milks before okay yeah i have so anyway back to what
(2:08:30) i was saying the most popular to what i was saying to angela they do they do tend to actually leave that industry and
(2:08:37) then they're not hooking up with people who are in the industry they're not marrying people who are in the industry
(2:08:42) uh things like this so most porn workers are not people you've ever heard of anyway and the shelf life for people who
(2:08:49) enter into pornography is very very low it's not something that they do usually long term i love how you just say things
(2:08:55) as if they're facts but then don't bring do you want to see you're actually wrong about that
(2:09:01) you want to see the shelf life of a porn worker yeah the battle on that and ron jeremy
(2:09:08) and how long does riley you can't bring up exceptions and claim they're the rule
(2:09:15) how insane are you lady oh if you're saying on average then sure but you're but you're on average we're talking
(2:09:21) about averages you're saying things you are not saying on averages that's by way it's 3 to four years 3 to four years
(2:09:28) it's 3 to four years yeah cuz the industry is hard it's it's a it's a it's a [ __ ] up industry that doesn't mean
(2:09:33) that like people are not interested in you after 3 or 4 years it just means that people just tend to leave the
(2:09:39) industry after 3 to four years because the industry tends to be very abusive especially for going into the
(2:09:44) industry working for yourself so then nina if the argument is but wait a second aren't all these porn stars just
(2:09:51) hooking up with people in the industry it's like well probably not since they're only in the industry on average for only a couple of years right nina
(2:09:58) okay but if they're in like if they're in that industry for that particular amount of time like um they're basically
(2:10:07) doing like on a daily basis [ __ ] somebody else because that's their job like i mean like it doesn't really matter how long they stay in it thank
(2:10:13) you for the non sequator but can you contend with my argument now well you're talking about sex workers correct yeah
(2:10:18) so what i said was the argument to me was was this andrew most of the time
(2:10:24) these people are hooking up with other people inside of the industry and it's like well not really because they have a
(2:10:30) limited shelf life inside of that industry so most of them are going with normies right it's not a it's not a
(2:10:36) limited shelf no no no no at all that like that that i if if there if you go
(2:10:42) into work every day right like um i don't know if you're retired or if you're still working in the job that you
(2:10:47) work in but like you go to work every day and you do your work there's these
(2:10:52) people are sex workers so they go into their work and they probably [ __ ] somebody every day that means if you go in like every how many how many how many
(2:11:00) days a year do you think you work uh probably probably 300 days i would
(2:11:06) guess something okay so then they probably are [ __ ] 300 you know maybe
(2:11:12) some crossover of different people but they're probably [ __ ] 300 people i'll
(2:11:17) humor it we're not necessarily saying that's the same person and i'm sure there's some crossover but
(2:11:24) like yeah okay so they probably got 300 body count you know give or take some crossover with the same people whatever
(2:11:31) so what is that or not like a professional aspect to the fact that
(2:11:36) they have a high body count it would be a professional aspect that they have a high body count okay so then why are you
(2:11:44) acting like that's not maybe i'm unsure what your argument was clearly even though i just restated it twice for you
(2:11:51) okay do it a third time okay so so here was the argument to me one more time the
(2:11:56) argument was gee andy and rachel uh most of the time inside of these industries
(2:12:02) these porn industries people call you andy can i call you andy yeah so anyway so you don't want to hear
(2:12:09) the argument no i don't want to hear the argument just i just thought i've never heard you refer to yourself as andy
(2:12:14) before i just thought it was i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i didn't mean to derail go ahead go ahead go ahead all people hang on let me make this clear
(2:12:21) let me make this clear on the andy thing anybody who has never engaged in prostitution can always call me andy
(2:12:28) okay wow what a dick she was nice to you too oh stop i'm not offended by it at
(2:12:34) all you don't you don't know you don't know the dynamic of it but anyway so so
(2:12:39) back back to where we were at the question that was posed uh about porn was are they dating inside of their own
(2:12:46) industry it's like maybe they are while they're in the industry that's probably every industry everybody works in they probably mostly date or pull out of
(2:12:52) their employee pool or whatever but the shelf life is very limited and you are going to have to contend with the fact
(2:12:57) that you were in porn at some point with whoever the normie is that you end up with and most of them are going to end
(2:13:02) up with normies if they end up with anybody because they have a shelf life that's the point you know okay first of all they don't have a shelf life just
(2:13:09) like any in like so for acting i would imagine that the average person who acts is also around 3 to four years because
(2:13:16) you have so many people trying it for like maybe a few months or a year and then quitting and so that's going to
(2:13:21) bring the statistical average down as opposed to people who genuinely take this on as a career and i'd imagine the
(2:13:26) average person who genuinely takes this on career only needs to do it for maybe a decade maybe decade and a half or two
(2:13:33) and every career has a shelf life every single every career has a shelf life but i don't think that the porn industry
(2:13:39) like i think has a shelf life because you just got done saying that and then you refuted your own argument 5 seconds
(2:13:44) later and said every industry has a shelf lifeantly talk over me because you don't make any sense in your arguments
(2:13:51) literally make no sense i just showed you a performative contradiction you just made inside of three sentences you
(2:13:57) said porn porn stars have no no shelf life and then you go on to say in every industry everybody has a shelf life they
(2:14:04) both can't be true at the same time geometry learn geometry lord jesus i didn't say porn stars
(2:14:12) themselves have a like porn stars themselves just like any other industry like any other person like an engineer
(2:14:19) doesn't have a shelf life but people in general believe after a certain amount
(2:14:24) of time because mathematically that's just you're going to have to have a number of averages eventually that's
(2:14:30) just how it works like a shelf life that's not a shelf life i don't shelf
(2:14:36) life no not only is it not only is it a shelf life is a perfect example so it's like milk right
(2:14:42) exactly milk has an expiration yeah but but but but here's the thing even though it has it has an expiration date it can
(2:14:49) be utilized after the expiration date and still not be bad or sometimes it'll sour before the expiration date so what
(2:14:54) we do is we look at the expiration date when generally it goes bad and when generally it doesn't and we say this is
(2:15:00) the shelf life of the milk just like we do with careers lauren right so engineers don't go bad after a certain
(2:15:07) amount of time but they still have bodies break down not only do their bodies break down but their minds break
(2:15:12) down and they do have an average shelf life of work yes they do i don't know where literally anybody has an average
(2:15:19) shelf life of work i have said that yes and she agreed she agreed with that statement two minutes ago let's move on
(2:15:26) then it means nothing so i have a question that gets more to the point of this can i can i kind of try to put it
(2:15:33) back on track so rather than talking about porn stars why don't we ask what
(2:15:38) would make so if you have a girl who sleeps with a different guy every weekend what do you think is making her
(2:15:45) do that that would not be problematic for a man who is considering you know a
(2:15:50) relationship with her what's behind like maybe she has been lonely she's been
(2:15:56) searching for hold on potentially she's dating these guys and if you're saying it's every
(2:16:02) weekend um maybe she is just really incapable
(2:16:08) of keeping a guy down and is not uh realizing that she should wait in a
(2:16:14) relationship in order to secure the man's interest for longer well i guess i
(2:16:20) i'd have to like flip that argument in a way where it's like okay so what if a dude's doing that like what what i think
(2:16:26) it's just kind of a human condition to like maybe [ __ ] around a little bit but like is there a difference between a man doing it and a woman doing it i think
(2:16:33) it's perceived differently i think it's a man wait uh rachel can you answer that
(2:16:39) question like or maybe you could ask andrew or or alex here like andrew and i actually agree on this a little bit
(2:16:46) andrew and i disagree on this a little bit because he thinks i do think male chastity is important from a religious
(2:16:52) perspective because um you know like if you're christian and you're trying to achieve theosis it's important in that
(2:16:58) way but i think just like in a secular psychological sense i think that men
(2:17:04) have a biological imperative to spread the seed far and wide and i think that women have a biological imperative to uh
(2:17:10) secure resources and security because as the childbearers we are tied down with
(2:17:15) any infant we have for about two years because we're nursing or kind of disable right so i think um it's not as
(2:17:23) big a deal for a guy to have a higher body count now would i want some guy who just bangs everything that moves no
(2:17:29) because that's just like gross and ger and like shows that he has no respect
(2:17:34) for himself but i do think that with a woman it is more important because we're the gatekeepers of sex and we are the
(2:17:40) selectors of who gets to pass their genetics on that is true okay so um but i then i
(2:17:48) have to ask you again the entire questions again um in the reverse where is it an issue for you if andrew had you
(2:17:56) know had multiple partners i mean again you don't answer just think uncomfortable like i'm just as an
(2:18:02) example you don't have to say directly him but like your your h obviously you're currently already married but
(2:18:07) like um would that be an issue for you if andrew uh andrew when he was young
(2:18:14) was quite the panty dropper and there was always [ __ ] chasing after him so it didn't bother me if anything it was
(2:18:20) like uh it kind of let me know that he's high value because all the women around were after him constantly so for and you
(2:18:27) know he was he was fairly selective but he wasn't you know i mean it was to me
(2:18:33) it was like okay this is a guy worth chasing after that's how i see it i know that's like incredibly based and most
(2:18:38) women won't agree did you kidnap that's how i personally no i just
(2:18:44) i was just constantly having to like fight off you know skanks all the time
(2:18:50) why were you so he was attracted to skanks and you had to fight them off
(2:18:56) huh so there were skanks that he was hanging out with no there was just
(2:19:01) always no it was like so he's he's a successful guy he had a good a very good
(2:19:06) job and so in his place of work he would have a rule that he would not eat lunch with anyone who was a woman he wouldn't
(2:19:14) be alone in any capacity with anyone who was a woman because they could see that he was good-looking and had a really
(2:19:20) good job and probably made good money and these girls were like you know working the lower level jobs so they
(2:19:25) would kind of chase after him it was just like it's what women do women are hypergamous and if they see a guy who
(2:19:31) they think is a good provider who is high value guy they're going to go after him right so um occasionally have you
(2:19:37) done that rachel me uh well i like that
(2:19:42) i think that i secured a guy that's probably just slightly out of my league
(2:19:48) yes you've never met a guy that makes more money than andrew no well i've never no
(2:19:55) i've never been able to date a guy who is more successful than andrew no what if you had the option to shouldn't you
(2:20:01) by nature do it then no because i've already picked him and we already have a whole family but you're my nature
(2:20:09) no it's it would actually so my chances now at 43 years old first of all statistically if i were to divorce
(2:20:16) andrew but if you had the chance but i wouldn't statistically have the chance but if you did yeah you guys are
(2:20:24) kind of missing you're missing an important point here which is that part part of the nature yeah part of part of
(2:20:32) the nature yeah part of the nature of this thing is that the value structure
(2:20:37) is a christian value structure and human beings are always fighting their nature male or or female just as males get
(2:20:44) tempted often by females who often try to put them in compromising positions or things like that wait so is and so you
(2:20:51) said is it just always going to be this is it just always going to be when's the last time x happened to you what does
(2:20:58) this have to do with anything so you settled true because he was the guy who made the most that you felt like well i
(2:21:05) mean nobody settled for you so people have tried to people have proposed but
(2:21:11) yeah but don't worry every single year that'll get a little bit harder than last year sweetheart
(2:21:16) and i have my options don't worry about me sweetie
(2:21:23) so even though i get what rachel's this example of andy being a high value man
(2:21:29) how many high value men do we have walking around that women have access to so saying that men having high body
(2:21:35) counts uh aren't actually an issue i don't see how that's actually like relevant to like the mass majority of
(2:21:40) men right well women always want the top 10% all
(2:21:45) of them think that they you know they're going to shoot their shot for the highest you know 10% i'm sure alex can
(2:21:52) tell you all about that they i did and i are you attracted to a dude that's
(2:21:57) [ __ ] more dude or not dudes i'm sorry i don't know what a question is for me [ __ ] more [ __ ] no i was saying
(2:22:05) that women are always chasing after the best guy they think they can get so it's
(2:22:10) relative right i am not i'm clearly not an instagram model i am not in the top 10% of women look-wise so i had to
(2:22:17) compensate with other things like loyalty um and you know being social
(2:22:22) less annoy being being less annoying than other women things like that being a really good mom that was like a huge
(2:22:28) thing for him so i you can make up i think you're beautiful i know nina thank
(2:22:33) you but i'm very i'm realistic and i have eyeballs and i'm 43 years old now so you know like was i hotter when i was
(2:22:40) younger totally wait let me try to answer rachel's
(2:22:45) question so i do think that women generally want to look for the best
(2:22:51) possible partner i think men are exactly like that too i think human beings in general look for the best possible
(2:22:56) partner they can get but i do think one big thing the red bull community misses is the concept of like investment uh so
(2:23:03) if you're like in a relationship like if you're in a relationship with a girl and she's happy and you're happy she's not
(2:23:09) going to just like break up with you because a higher value guy comes along so investment counterbalances i guess
(2:23:14) hypergamy but yeah that's just kind of my take anyway if if her genuine though
(2:23:19) then you would find what you would consider like the most high value men in society typically marrying 18year-old
(2:23:27) virgin only fans models but if you look at the high value men in our society like zuckerberg gates
(2:23:34) um musk other they don't tend musk is musk continually gets married to new
(2:23:40) people but they tend to go for women who are in their 30s or even their 40s uh m
(2:23:47) oh bloomberg um who was the other one that i was thinking of like all the wealthiest men in the world tend to date
(2:23:54) older women who and sometimes previously divorced women so uh yeah that if your
(2:24:02) model doesn't actually apply to reality and then i'm also grateful and i'm grateful i'm also finding a lot of the
(2:24:08) times uh the people who push these models since for instance the red pill communities for instance sneer my all of
(2:24:16) these men date women with extremely high body counts who have done only fans who
(2:24:21) so they and are not 18 and so the men who are pushing these ideologies are not even attracted to the woman they said
(2:24:28) say that all men should be attracted to absolutely okay but this is the thing that you're
(2:24:34) you're kind of missing with that so like when you're talking about people like zirka zirka is literally insane god
(2:24:40) bless him don't talk [ __ ] about my boy he is crazy though you're right he is
(2:24:46) crazy but i you know i'm i don't think there's anything you know i i'm not hating on him i think he's pretty funny
(2:24:52) but i mean he these guys are living like a rockstar life you know so they're not
(2:24:57) looking for wives and moms they're not settling down at all when you do look at men who marry and their high status so
(2:25:03) like robert dairo has a far younger girlfriend right now uh leonardo dicaprio always he like chucks girls to
(2:25:11) the curb once they hit like 23 and he gets no matter how old he doesn't want to turn her into a wife exactly the high
(2:25:20) value men that marry other women tend to marry women who are in their early 30s
(2:25:26) maybe late 30s and are frequently once divorced wait what what happened to andrew
(2:25:32) he died when i rachel killed him his computer crashed he's getting it back up
(2:25:37) he just bought all the stuff to uh build a new one but the one he has right now is uh band-aided together at the moment
(2:25:44) let's do like uh five more minutes of this topic and then we'll move on to the uh after panel post show uh okay keep
(2:25:51) going it's all it's all ladies now except for go ahead rachel do you i i i mean you have kids uh i know right like
(2:25:59) you you have like four or five five yeah five do do you think it's irresponsible
(2:26:05) for um robert is it both of them i don't remember robert diro or one of them they're like incredibly old and like
(2:26:13) they're they're going to die before their kids ever know them right do you do you feel that that's a little irresponsible for
(2:26:20) um them to be having children at the age that they're at
(2:26:26) it it's i would say it's probably not ideal i don't know if you would say
(2:26:32) irresponsible i mean it's not ideal i think the statistics are super duper
(2:26:37) clear about uh fathers in the home being like a serious yeah like if they're
(2:26:42) going to die it's kind of like the same thing right yeah i think it's probably not ideal no i mean i don't know if it's
(2:26:50) like morally wrong or maybe you could argue it i mean wouldn't you argue that it's the same where it's like if if we
(2:26:56) don't have the fathers in the home like if they die because they're old like doesn't that seem like the same level of
(2:27:02) irresponsibility yeah but i think that men having children in their 70s and
(2:27:07) stuff is like really rare so i'm not super concerned about this but you think yeah do you think it's immoral though
(2:27:13) like i i i kind of think it's kind of [ __ ] up personally i mean if it happens accidentally it happens accidentally sure whatever but i i think
(2:27:20) it was not that in this particular situation
(2:27:25) well i don't know but we were supposed to be talking about like how men should feel about women's body counts and i was
(2:27:32) my point was like okay if you're choosing a potential mother for your children do you want a woman who's got
(2:27:39) like you know a super high body count because especially nowadays if she is
(2:27:44) model because if she's an only fans especially if it's okay but what if she's not she just [ __ ] a lot of
(2:27:50) people she just like had like a crazy summer where she went that i think
(2:27:55) divorce is risky enough for men these days without adding to the fact this woman clearly has like pretty low
(2:28:01) standards i don't see what i'm related to divorce i i'll explain it if you want to know i'll
(2:28:08) explain go ahead go ahead if if a woman has a super high body count she clearly
(2:28:14) grants access very easily right the the bar for access has to be low that's not
(2:28:20) annie wasn't wanting to say like what was a high body count what would you consider a high body count
(2:28:26) uh well it depends because i i think that if you don't get married by the
(2:28:32) time you're 30 like your odds of getting married at all drop off a cliff and if you get to 30 and you're not a virgin uh
(2:28:40) you're probably having a decent amount of partners maybe not but if you're not it depends i'm just asking more of a
(2:28:47) number i love how this is not based on like yeah like what are you basing this like do you have a number because
(2:28:53) there's too many as you said earlier there's too many variables right so it depends on the age of the person it
(2:28:58) depends on isolating variables have you heard of that yes i know what isolated variables right but like what i i'm just
(2:29:05) asking you for number what do you think is what would you think like like i mean
(2:29:10) like i don't again i don't want to delve too much into your personal life i know you're saying that you don't want to talk about this so i don't virginity is
(2:29:18) ideal and the less the better um i think if it's o i probably it's but this is
(2:29:24) the thing right it's arbitrary no matter what it's going to be somewhat arbitrary no matter i have to ask you i have to
(2:29:31) hold on really really quick hang rachel you're right it is arbitrary but the
(2:29:37) question is uh like according to your standards right so it is i do think it's
(2:29:42) important to give at least a ballpark because what could be a really high body count for you i'll try to ballpark it
(2:29:48) yeah just ballpark if if my to use the example that alice put out if my son came to me and my son is 22 and he's
(2:29:56) dating a girl his same age i would say under five would be good if she's 22
(2:30:03) because hopefully she hasn't for a second no like under five bodies if she's 22
(2:30:10) years old would probably be good uh but yeah there's like factors so again if
(2:30:16) you get to like 30 and you only have five that's pretty good you know say you've been sexually active for 12 years
(2:30:22) you've only done it with five guys that's only one guy every two plus years if you are 18 and you've got a body
(2:30:30) count of 12 that's a problem i guess i i i kind of wonder like do we add the
(2:30:35) aspect of like how much are you [ __ ] the same per like if you're like with one person you're [ __ ] every single
(2:30:41) day like it's it's a different body so that's the thing is like how many different men are you granting access to
(2:30:47) the difference it's a big difference because you are
(2:30:52) it's indicative of your ability to hold together a relationship it's indicative
(2:30:58) of your ability to grant access to just whoever right so if you're the kind of
(2:31:03) girl have you wanted home every night yeah well my husband yeah well i have i
(2:31:10) have never so i'm divorced i have everyone knows
(2:31:16) yes it wasn't my it wasn't my choice um it wasn't my choice anyways uh so no i
(2:31:22) would have done literally anything to avoid that but unavoidable and out of respect for my ex who is still around um
(2:31:28) i'm not going to like tell his business but it was not my yeah so but no i don't
(2:31:35) like i've never been one of these women that just has casual sex i've never done that the only people i've slept with i
(2:31:41) was in very long-term relationships with so i don't really get the whole just wanting to bang a stranger thing i think
(2:31:47) it's like it kind of creeps me out to be honest wh why why do you not understand that like you just never wanted to [ __ ]
(2:31:54) every once or have you always been with somebody i've i've only been single for like six months of my adult life okay
(2:32:00) well that makes i've always been in a long-term relationship i've only ever been like in a really long term like
(2:32:07) marriages basically um but what if what if andrew got hit by a car and he died
(2:32:15) uh that would probably be it horrible of course that would probably be it for me unless some fantastic amazing person
(2:32:22) came along but i'm 43 i've always you wouldn't just want to like just [ __ ] somebody just like to get your rocks off
(2:32:27) or whatever maybe but like my i have values that don't allow me to just well
(2:32:33) i mean he's dead you're not betraying him he's dead literally death to your heart but in in my religion i'm an
(2:32:39) orthodox christian so we don't just randomly bang people like it would have to be it's supposed to be within the
(2:32:46) sacrament of marriage only um so at this point in my life as an orthodox
(2:32:51) christian who's had plenty of you know married sex uh no i don't just have this
(2:32:57) insatiable urge to just like collect dicks we are kind of getting near the end i do
(2:33:04) have a quite a few questions i actually want to ask uh mainly miss wilson but uh
(2:33:09) i'll give like the two-minut thing so if you guys have any points you want to make maybe andrew could just come and hang out with you or something so easier
(2:33:16) um i think he's getting it back up i think so i'm just go i'm going to go to say uh being that lauren is a virgin lol
(2:33:24) and then nina has had an only fan so you're very as angela i'm a virgin too
(2:33:30) i've never had sex plenty of virgins i have heard that from alex uh me and my girlfriend we don't have sex we just
(2:33:36) look at each other we just wash dishes together like edging like edging but
(2:33:42) partner form very hot very sexy i'm into love that for you and going back to this
(2:33:49) my memory is getting blleh as we get later so go ahead i personally don't engage into hookup culture i don't under
(2:33:55) i don't agree with it but i know plenty of people do it that it goes with like a certain lifestyle and i think it's normal for them you don't agree with
(2:34:01) hookup culture excuse me you said you don't agree with hookup hook i don't
(2:34:07) agree with participating in it like it's not my thing gotcha gotcha gotcha okay gotcha but i can understand for i guess like the generation right now also
(2:34:13) depending on like being in miami meeting people who are active online streamers and and sex workers it's really normal
(2:34:20) and i think that there's this huge disconnect of people that watch this type of content not
(2:34:25) understanding tom you're funny anyways uh yeah so listening to this
(2:34:32) conversation i can understand like i think there's a huge disconnect when we talk about body counts because rachel said here that five like normal up to
(2:34:39) like 30 somebody else that i talked to that's part of like the insult community would say that's too [ __ ] high nina
(2:34:44) saying it's normal to be engaging in hookup culture somebody will say it's not so it just again it goes back to saying like who exactly are we talking
(2:34:51) to we're saying is a high body count too high and i just really depends on who who the hell are we talking to cuz as
(2:34:57) somebody who works in a nail salon i got to say like there's a bunch of old farts in there that are happy to date these [ __ ] on the bimbos and the yachts and
(2:35:03) they're completely fine after they're divorced they're fine those girls are rocking their [ __ ] life off in the hookup culture and it doesn't really
(2:35:08) matter so if we're talking about the young guys who don't have a choice but if you're asking them hey would you want
(2:35:13) a girl who hasn't had bodies a girl who has 20 50 bodies he's going to choose obviously the no bodies because if
(2:35:19) you're not getting any bodies you're going to make sure you're secure the one who isn't [ __ ] everybody uh i think that we're not really narrowing down who
(2:35:25) we're talking about and it's just too broad for me to like but if you just want your dick sucked you're gonna go with the one to most bodies because like
(2:35:32) yeah if you just want your dick they're going to know what they want you know yeah but i think like if these guys are trying to secure hopefully a longlasting
(2:35:39) i don't know a body that continuously come around whenever he wants this has to be somebody who's like stable enough to want to be sleeping with i will say
(2:35:46) this i did poll the chat and i asked which would you prefer a virgin or a
(2:35:51) girl with five sexual partners 73% said a virgin
(2:35:58) what were you for alex's chat let's go that is our point that there's a large
(2:36:03) portion in fact you said about 30% of the your chat said that they less than
(2:36:08) 30 so 73% said they want a virgin and 27 27% wanted a non virgin you're saying no
(2:36:17) then what would the average be lauren can can you ask the the same question but with a [ __ ]
(2:36:24) and also you answer you know the answers are going to be different i'll do i'll
(2:36:29) do it for you nina i'll do it for you you guys want a [ __ ] [ __ ] from some [ __ ] random [ __ ] who's never
(2:36:36) had a dick in their mouth like come on again what on earth are you doing that
(2:36:41) you need amount of different dicks to figure it out i do not understand the dick for i disagree with
(2:36:49) all of them i would take your girl i mean i remember being like a like younger person and thinking like it was
(2:36:55) called sucking dick so i was just like literally sucking like it was a [ __ ] straw and that was probably the worst
(2:37:00) [ __ ] anyone's ever ever gotten yeah so let's be real going from like what
(2:37:05) you just said your poll like alex this is this is your channel your channel is predominantly like a dating uh thing
(2:37:11) where a lot of these guys are struggling so they're gonna be picking virgins just i mean and you channel i would angela i
(2:37:18) would actually expect it to be the opposite because i feel like like my my chat may be right heavily christian
(2:37:23) dominated i'm actually surprised by the responses because i would i've made countless videos where i said yo virgins
(2:37:30) are overrated uh i hooked up with virgins not that pleasant but yeah i guess so now knowing that so now knowing
(2:37:35) that oh sorry go ahead no sorry but like alex you're the host it's your channel that's your view you're teaching them so
(2:37:41) people that you're teaching obviously don't have the exact values they have to be taught these things so they're going to be like holding strong on the fact
(2:37:47) that they want virgins because they can't even get a date with a girl so to to play it safe that's their first
(2:37:52) option but like they for example steven crowder i really don't think he's going to be picking another virgin someone who has experience or someone who's had
(2:37:59) partners like alex and other people who engage into hookup culture are going to say "hey i want someone who has a normal
(2:38:04) amount of bodies or bodies it doesn't bother them as opposed to getting a virgin." steven crowder is gonna be
(2:38:09) steven crowder's gonna be picking a dude because he's gay true yeah you know the recent uh so now knowing this so now
(2:38:17) knowing this i just straight guys don't send dickpicks d would you would if you guys would modify your answer now when i
(2:38:23) asked the question if all things were equal between the two women uh it was
(2:38:28) the exact same woman it's just you could have her before she had the body count or after
(2:38:34) your mic went out you're cut out i think he said before or after like if like somebody had like a high body count you
(2:38:40) had two identical women one had a body count of five one had a body count of nine which one was more preferable to
(2:38:47) the average dude and once again it's just preference based you're going to have a group of men whether it might be
(2:38:55) would be though you're really average above 50 meaning above 50 that means
(2:39:01) almost nothing so yeah there's a group of men and maybe that group of men is slightly larger for those who would want
(2:39:07) the virgin but there's also a very large group of men that wouldn't prefer the virgin it's a large group i agree but
(2:39:13) it's a minority in comparison to the average at least with this poll chat at 27% so i'm going to ask you again at
(2:39:20) least based on this poll chat and these are dgens which do you think they'd prefer because they just told you
(2:39:26) depends on the person and maybe maybe more men would choose the virgin but
(2:39:32) there's a large group of men who would prefer not the virgin i mean i i've taken like a dude's
(2:39:39) virginity like and it's like they [ __ ] suck like it's like whatever but i liked the person so it was like fine
(2:39:45) but like it just like i don't understand why that would be appealing to people alex i hope these nina how many how many
(2:39:52) different dicks do you have to suck in order to figure out how that works like i want to turn i want to turn the
(2:39:58) question around question that you've asked like 10 times that makes no sense that just shows that your lack of
(2:40:04) relationship and then your issues in your own life but anyway i'm ask i'm asking nina because she everybody needed
(2:40:10) to know from nina i'm sorry what was your question how many body counts is gohead ask your question so you said
(2:40:16) like in order to be good at sex you have to have a lot of different men to have sex with like why can't you practice
(2:40:23) with the same person to get good at sex why do you need sure no you absolutely can practice with the same person i
(2:40:29) don't need to have sex with different dudes you don't have to that's all different i think like just
(2:40:36) having more sexual experience how would you know lauren you're a virgin you can't comment on the i think in this argument she's just
(2:40:44) saying that it it you just need experience that experience could be with one partner but if you're a
(2:40:50) virgin have experience right but just just having one partner could give you as much experience as a girl with 20
(2:40:56) bodies right it just comes down to yeah i i i don't think they're mutually exclusive like i absolutely agree with
(2:41:01) that what you're saying and it's just like i just think like like somebody having experience i think is probably a pretty good thing especially if you're
(2:41:08) interested in like having some like good [ __ ] sex like if you're talking about a relationship then the body count
(2:41:14) shouldn't matter right like this seems immaterial if you're just talking about having a relationship with somebody i
(2:41:19) don't think the relationship aspect of this would or body count i guess to to
(2:41:25) keep with the premise should at all impact what type of relationship you can
(2:41:30) have but if we're talking about sex like i think that it would actually kind of be you know a little bit of a buff there
(2:41:36) because they probably know what the [ __ ] they're doing but to steelman than the other side uh the debate is kind of
(2:41:43) ending so i feel like get involved a little bit more i i was just curious though um do you do you like tell them
(2:41:48) where you learned where you tell them where you learned all the tricks question do you tell them where you
(2:41:54) learned all the tricks do you go yeah for my ex-boyfriend do you andrew andrew
(2:41:59) andrew let me ask the question then you can ask your question uh okay so the question on what rachel is saying is
(2:42:06) that a girl with a high body count doesn't that signal that she might have other characteristics that are
(2:42:12) incompatible for a long-term relationship like she could be very novelty driven like she could be afraid
(2:42:17) of commitment like she could have some emotional trauma so maybe it's not directly the body count that's making
(2:42:23) her less uh suitable for a long-term partner it's all the other things that are associated with it
(2:42:29) absolutely but the the thing i would say is that applies to both ends of it if you're talking about like on on both
(2:42:36) partners like i i i don't think those are independently related to like women
(2:42:42) or men i think that it's just yeah that that absolutely can be indicative of those things and that's why you should
(2:42:48) get to know somebody but i don't think that means because they have a high body count that means that that is a a factor
(2:42:54) um but you're right that that is a possibility but that's why you get to know somebody of course in a
(2:43:00) relationship right okay let's let andrew ask this question go ahead yeah i was just curious when you were talking about
(2:43:05) how you're gonna have the most bombastic sex ever do you tell your partner where you learned your trick you'd be like "well fred taught me that one." is that
(2:43:12) is that something which comes up in the course or do you think maybe they wouldn't want to know you think maybe they would be like "ah you know i really
(2:43:18) don't want to hear about you and fred having sex and that's where you learn how to do that thing." i'm asking you nina this question no i well i think
(2:43:25) that would be a that's like a really psychotic thing to say like nobody would say that right and why do you think that
(2:43:30) they wouldn't want to know that information nina i have no idea you have no idea you just just because they
(2:43:37) wouldn't you said it's a psychotic thing but you have no idea no i think it would just be odd to say that so i don't would
(2:43:44) they want to have that information would it be why is it that you think that they wouldn't want to know how did you learn
(2:43:49) how to suck no i'm just asking you i'm just asking you do you like me they're like "do you do you ever tell your
(2:43:55) partner like "oh yeah i learned that from chuck and fred and john."
(2:44:00) well i mean why wouldn't you don't do you think you want to hear it okay to to
(2:44:05) then comment on like nah's side it would be like your wife telling you about a big [ __ ] she took like why would she not
(2:44:11) do that so my whole so my whole point here actually alex is my my
(2:44:18) whole point here is to this point which is he doesn't want to [ __ ] hear about it why do you think he doesn't want to
(2:44:24) hear about it i didn't i'm not telling him about who would you think that he
(2:44:30) wouldn't want to hear about it why would you why do you think that that would be the response i'm not talking about it are you constantly talking about it
(2:44:36) answer my question don't ask me a question to answer my question just answer my question you have to say what
(2:44:42) you're saying i don't understand why do i think that he doesn't know but you're asking a hypothetical and something that
(2:44:47) it's like why do you think he wouldn't want to know that information why do you think why i'm asking you i'm asking you
(2:44:54) 50 times why don't you tell me you don't think that it's because the person who you're in a relationship with doesn't
(2:45:00) want to think about former sexual partners because it's revoling okay so that's how what you that's what
(2:45:06) you think that's what every man thinks that unless he's a [ __ ] andrew is right
(2:45:12) yeah that is that is kind of how and so but you think that because you can you can more and more you can have more and
(2:45:19) more and more dudes that you have sex with and you think though that even though the permanent statistina
(2:45:25) nina you think that permanently all right having sex with tons of dudes that
(2:45:31) this is not going to be revoling every single dude you add to the list of course it is well let me ask you this no
(2:45:38) it's not no it's not there's many hey lauren hold on jesus i was like why
(2:45:47) for the same reason that if you were to volunteer whatever the sex sexual intercourse you had with another man was
(2:45:53) to the man you're currently engaged to in some way whether it's um maybe even
(2:45:58) if it's a fling they probably don't want to hear that because it's revoling to them to think that somebody else is
(2:46:05) banging their chick it's revoling to almost every man currently banging in their chick so why is it when it comes
(2:46:10) to the past what's the issue well so this with you at the moment this is
(2:46:15) what's intuitive right they don't want to hear about it because their intuition tells them this is revoling so if men's
(2:46:21) intuition's telling them it's revolting you've been with other men i don't even want to think about the fact that you've been with other men that's a bad thing
(2:46:27) that you've been with other men it probably lowers your value to most men you see how that works
(2:46:35) but what if they i want i want to i want to guide him down the y path here i i don't think why does there need to be a
(2:46:41) y why can't it just be a preference chicks like tall dudes why
(2:46:47) go ahead ask away why why what why are they
(2:46:53) revolted by it mhm likely because of a combination of factors one of the
(2:46:59) combination of factors being that psychologically inside of men it's a red
(2:47:04) flag when women have had multiple sexual partners and they don't they clearly don't want to think about it another
(2:47:10) reason is virtues another i'm giving you multiple reasons okay right and don't by
(2:47:16) the way don't ask me why say why and then a specific question stop you don't need to do this whole thing go ahead
(2:47:22) okay so that that's two right there do you have any reputations to either of those no i wanted to ask you why i just
(2:47:29) answered both your question as to why you just named other things and then you didn't explain them i did explain them
(2:47:36) would you do you want a further explanation yes they're revolted they are revolted
(2:47:42) by the fact that you have been sleeping with other men because it has a psychological red flag impact on them so
(2:47:49) when they think about it what is the red flag impact the red flag is that if they're thinking about you having sex
(2:47:54) with other men and they're revolted by it that's the red flag what is the red flag who's who's red flag then the woman
(2:48:02) or the man well for the man the woman would be red flagged
(2:48:08) so it's a red flag for the man to see that the woman is a like a a red flag
(2:48:17) that literally didn't make any sense nina well i don't know you're the one that explained it that way i mean no
(2:48:22) like to be fair very simply it's just revoling it's like hearing about your girlfriend taking it why why is it
(2:48:28) revoling okay oh that's fair that's fair okay then let's just go on that like do i do i know the neuroscientific reason
(2:48:33) why it's revolting i know it's revoling well tell me your opinion we're i'm talking to you
(2:48:41) i think that uh it offers up massive red flags and that pro promiscuity is a
(2:48:46) turnoff it's revoling because there's red flags and and promiscuity is a turnoff to most men so if you're
(2:48:53) promiscuous no i'm asking you and i'm telling you literally telling you the answer to your question nina okay so
(2:49:00) promiscuity is a red flag for men the more promiscuous you are the less loyal that we think you are including me yes
(2:49:06) of course promiscuity is a big red flag for me don't like promiscuous women never liked promiscuous women never going to like promiscuous women because
(2:49:13) i find it revolting that women have tons of sexual partners that's why
(2:49:19) okay but why what okay you need to understand like i'm trying to i'm trying to have you like go down the path here
(2:49:26) you're saying that you well then you need to ask questions other than why i am i think it's pretty clear what i'm
(2:49:31) asking say why and then ask the question okay fair enough fair enough why do you find it revoling that women have
(2:49:37) multiple sexual partners because it's intuitive because okay why is it intuitive
(2:49:45) i think he's also because it's part hang on because it's part of my onlogical being that it's intuitive that's why i
(2:49:51) need not at all an answer how i could not give you a better answer that that's
(2:49:58) the most specific answer i could possibly give you why why do you find it revolting if you watch a puppy getting
(2:50:04) kicked in front of you why is that revoling for you because i find the loss of a life of a puppy um u upsetting
(2:50:12) right it goes against what you value well and for andrew he values no i can actually answer that question instead of
(2:50:18) like dodging around it like andrew is doing i don't think he's dodging i can answer it how could how did i dodge k no
(2:50:24) i need you to tell me how i dodged this i was the most rachel answer it do you want to answer no i want you to tell me
(2:50:30) how i dodged because that was your accusation no i want you to tell me how i dodged it as nature i just feel like i
(2:50:36) didn't get a good question of like you're saying which part was not answered like literally none of it like i was
(2:50:42) asking you why do you feel this way and then you wouldn't answer as to why you
(2:50:48) just kind of kept okay let's let's let's let rachel give her two seconds yeah so if something is cheap
(2:50:55) and easy to get is it valuable yes oh my god no it's not by definition
(2:51:04) water and electricity valuable yes water water and electricity are actually not
(2:51:10) cheap and easy to get that's what i have do you have any idea what it takes to
(2:51:16) power the modern grid because nina could tell you all about it sure sure sure but
(2:51:22) i'm like do you mean valuable in a personal level or by like literally like monetary material and metaphysical
(2:51:30) here's an example here's an example do you want the $10 purse from target or do you want the $800 birkin bag which is
(2:51:38) more valuable to people for $800 well i don't know how much this [ __ ]
(2:51:44) costs okay the expensive designer purse shut up the expensive designer purse
(2:51:51) notice by the neither of you answered the question
(2:51:58) birkin bag it's probably from thailand and i probably don't oh my god
(2:52:06) answer the question was is the preference that or the i don't give a [ __ ] about bags probably the $10 one i
(2:52:12) don't know i don't like i don't like expensive [ __ ]
(2:52:17) i don't i personally don't like expensive [ __ ] i'm going to very quickly uh steal man andrew and rachel's
(2:52:23) position i think well i want i want rachel to have her whole point though like my whole point is is that if
(2:52:29) something is cheap and easy to get it goes down in value and if it is in high demand and difficult to get it goes up
(2:52:36) in value that's how things work i think those are i think those are additional reasons but i think the crux of it is
(2:52:43) that for andrew and i think rachel uh having sex comes with a certain level of
(2:52:48) uh emotional exclusivity and just exclusivity in general so for them it's like they're having sex with people they
(2:52:55) care about and their world view and so to imagine your partner that you care
(2:53:00) about that you see a future with that you might get married to or are married to talking about having sex with another
(2:53:07) person is just repugnant and repulsive because they envision that person to be
(2:53:13) ex sexually exclusive with them and they're being reminded it's like kind of like a slap in the face like "oh yeah well i [ __ ] this guy."
(2:53:20) but alex why uh human nature i guess in your world
(2:53:27) yeah but why i imagine you would have hang on alex but why though are you
(2:53:33) trying to mean the fact that i asked you why i can't w with you when i'm stealing you wait why because why do you love
(2:53:40) your wife i know you pretty well but i don't know you that make fun of me for that
(2:53:46) well we met like a year ago we you know we've never met but this was an
(2:53:51) extremely extremely um well done advertisement that did
(2:53:57) really well and sold a lot of cars for a used bmw and you can't read it but it shows a very pretty girl and then the
(2:54:04) tagline is you know you're not the first but do you care and it's a it's a used
(2:54:09) car advertisement that does very well because men get the concept that you might not care if she's the first if
(2:54:15) she's that [ __ ] hot that's not why it did well it didn't do well it didn't it
(2:54:20) didn't do well because this chick is being marketed as being prefucked it did well because it's funny and so therefore
(2:54:26) it's memorable that's why it did well it's funny because it's true you wouldn't care yes it's funny no no
(2:54:33) that's the ultimate irony is what makes it what makes it hilarious right is that
(2:54:39) ironic it's ironically not true cuz you do care no you don't cuz it's
(2:54:45) for you that's what makes it funny is the irony
(2:54:50) that's literally what makes it funny is the irony yes it is
(2:54:56) makes sense that you wouldn't get the joke but all right all right all right all right i just this is why men are
(2:55:01) objectively funnier than than women women don't understand here i'm curious on her
(2:55:06) opinion on this subject before you do that let me just introduce one piece of data to this so i did the poll you asked
(2:55:12) me for nita and you were actually correct the results were pretty different so for a below job would you
(2:55:17) prefer a virgin 52% said a virgin and uh 48% said a girl with a five body count
(2:55:24) so the results on that were slightly different yeah slightly yeah everybody
(2:55:29) knows that men will just pump and dump hose and they marry girls who are uh
(2:55:35) have a higher bar for access and no matter how much these girls want to cope
(2:55:40) no matter how much these girls want to cope no matter how much these girls want
(2:55:45) to cope men don't like hoes except for to use them and throw them away quite a
(2:55:52) bit to use them and throw them away like kleenex not to wipe them true you're
(2:55:58) coping pretty hard and not bringing data i mean like i haven't presented any data
(2:56:03) you literally have not presented any data where where is the data where is it for
(2:56:08) what what look up brought up the divorce rates where are they show me all the hoes getting wiped up faster than girls
(2:56:16) you want me to look up getting that i brought up earlier look up that exact word where where where are they which
(2:56:23) study you want the family did a video on it about how it dips and you lauren is
(2:56:30) trying to tell us water isn't wet she's insisting water isn't wet i never said water isn't wet but that's
(2:56:37) okay trying to tell us that women that men want hoes you're trying to tell us
(2:56:42) men would rather marry hoes than they would let me ask you let me ask you
(2:56:48) ridiculous rachel your husband was calling me a [ __ ] because i have a only fence no i wasn't calling you a [ __ ] i
(2:56:54) said you engaged you literally specifically called me a [ __ ] directly no that would that would mean a hooker i
(2:56:59) said prostitute oh sure whatever does it really matter it matters cuz one's
(2:57:04) engaging in sex and the other one's prostituting themselves it matters to him cuz he's autistic so he matters on his dictionary
(2:57:13) i'm sorry listen i'm sorry intelligence upsets you okay i'm asking the question
(2:57:19) before lauren calls says that you have a small dick or that you want to [ __ ] her and if you don't want to [ __ ] her that
(2:57:25) you're dead or whatever yeah i get it um anyways moving on um do you think that it's unfair for your husband to say
(2:57:34) i i said if you want me to repeat i said i probably do think he's gay based off what the woman looks like who he married
(2:57:39) we're all gay it's okay oh i would be so hurt i would be so hurt if i wasn't
(2:57:46) already married and had five kids and had a successful life and you're 29 and alone because nobody can stand the sound
(2:57:52) of your voice you've been married how many times you guys both literally sound no she's saying i've been married twice
(2:57:59) she's so twice as many times as lauren i will debate you oneon one lauren you
(2:58:04) should debate me oneon-one and i will end you i will completely terminate your online career in one debate that seems
(2:58:12) kind of like a marriage i can't hear you because you sound like the only thing
(2:58:18) that you can end is your first marriage the only first marriage you can end is
(2:58:25) your first marriage you can't even marriage me we could just [ __ ] off i i
(2:58:31) didn't but anyways what were you saying rachel started numeric and ended one you haven't even got to the starting point
(2:58:36) ultimate cat fight uh she's mad because the lawyer is too
(2:58:41) stupid to argue don't ever hire this person to be your lawyer holy [ __ ] she can't argue her way out of a paper that
(2:58:47) you do for a living what are you what's your educational background uh well i'm a best-selling author
(2:58:55) best-selling does that count yeah i have a best-selling book yes she was on tucker carlson yeah she was on tucker
(2:59:03) carlson as well what about you though when are you going to start we've already got fired
(2:59:10) my most important accomplishment is raising five fabulous human beings what's your book called it's called oult
(2:59:16) feminism what's your book called ault feminism well i was a math major not a literary person right so you haven't
(2:59:22) written a book you haven't done anything of note you're not married andrew have you read you're an imbecile you can't argue you think that argument structure
(2:59:29) has to do with geometry i mean he doesn't know of logic
(2:59:36) geometry and argument structure i love it all right all right listen y'all are
(2:59:41) all smart people let's move on to the after panel uh any last everyone can make a 15 20 second closing statement if
(2:59:49) they want to or not uh lauren we'll start i'd love to okay you can you can
(2:59:55) let lauren you can let lauren go ahead you go ahead you start yes lauren's googling my book so she can find some
(3:00:02) troll reviews and try to like talk some [ __ ] but that's fine everybody can see what happened here and uh what happened
(3:00:09) is giant coke from lauren about uh you know men actually would rather marry uh
(3:00:17) girls who are kind of hoes uh there's no data proving that body counts matter um
(3:00:24) i wish i would have gotten to argue no fault divorce with her because she she was wrong about a lot of stuff there
(3:00:30) that's kind of my jam it's my specialty this is my she was asking about my educational background and this is a
(3:00:37) living but um what what lauren has done here is
(3:00:43) just devolve into total this is what happens anytime uh that i debate a woman for the first time they have absolute
(3:00:49) emotional breakdown the resort can name calling personal attack she doesn't have any arguments her closing yes my closing
(3:00:57) you can just shut your mouth um but she's not used to being she's not used
(3:01:03) to being told no she's not used to having anybody not tell her "oh sweetie you're so smart so wonderful." so the i
(3:01:10) don't think personal attack should be in your closing let's keep it subject oh that's not your panel nina i mean you
(3:01:16) have not your closing 15 seconds yeah 15 seconds there was no
(3:01:22) argument here andrew did not need any help to do this i just wanted to jump in because it was just so it was like nails
(3:01:29) on a chalkboard except for angela angela was nice nah's fair at least nah's fair but um no there was no andrew absolutely
(3:01:37) completely single-handedly demolished this whole thing what the [ __ ] i don't get compliments alex you were a great
(3:01:43) moderator it's adorable you saying that and i do and i do love you rachel but uh
(3:01:49) i think lauren had some i need i need validation every 20 minutes so i can feel good okay alex you're great we love
(3:01:55) you let's let's go to um angela and then we'll go and andrew will wrap it up okay
(3:02:00) angela yeah so as i stated i the body count conversation i find it highly irritable
(3:02:06) i just think that there's no way to really measure uh what is high i think it depends on who we're talking about
(3:02:12) and what you do on your day-to-day basis and depending on who you are and what's your preference and i think that yes if
(3:02:18) we're going to the extreme and say an average guy wouldn't want a girl who has like a body count of like 50 or 60 when
(3:02:24) he's only had one or two yeah i that's a huge extreme obviously but um i just
(3:02:30) think it's these conversations are just so extreme so yeah i wanted to be combative and annoying but i couldn't do it because i couldn't find something
(3:02:35) that i solely agree on because there's no way to measure these things and uh yeah that's that's pretty much it
(3:02:43) all right nina oh this is a little messy um i i just
(3:02:49) think that um obviously my best friends uh andrew and rachel uh it's hard to
(3:02:55) always argue about them um but i think lauren had some really good points going into this um i think that it's really
(3:03:02) stupid to think that somebody's value is based off of their sexual experiences
(3:03:07) and as a bad thing cuz honestly you ever been with somebody who can't make you
(3:03:12) come feels really [ __ ] bad dude i would be pretty [ __ ] poged out to
(3:03:18) have a dude that like is able to like make you come immediately like i don't understand like what this argument is
(3:03:24) about like oh i want somebody less experienced the only thing that i could possibly think of somebody wanting
(3:03:29) somebody less experienced is cuz they're insecure they don't understand how to do it and they don't want to learn it just
(3:03:36) seems like some dumbass like ego [ __ ] where like um i'm i'm really
(3:03:43) worried that like some other chick got [ __ ] down harder than i could possibly do and i think it's
(3:03:49) pathetic and it's for [ __ ] losers you know i'll introduce you to my man ben thorp he's uh no you're so mean no i
(3:03:58) would like you to call the police about benthorp if he's anywhere near there should be a benthorp like camera that if
(3:04:06) it spots him near your property it automatically calls the call andrew has been very explicit about the fact that
(3:04:11) he doesn't want to be on the panel with this i told you i i am not going to be on a panel with him or grace anymore
(3:04:18) because i want to request it okay lauren you're next um i think
(3:04:24) that it's hard to isolate the variables of body count and if we're looking at this from a scientific perspective or or
(3:04:32) if we're saying that men in general prefer something um you're negating uh
(3:04:37) how small that minority or how large that minority might be because maybe the minority is just 48% so if you're trying
(3:04:44) to paint things as a pretty brush of men in general prefer things uh we're we're
(3:04:49) really not talking about men in we're not really we're excluding a large
(3:04:54) portion of men and we're not talking about the reality of the world that we live in furthermore the people that that
(3:05:02) push the propaganda and the ideology that men only want virgins are not the ones who are end up dating virgins even
(3:05:09) andrew on this panel has married somebody who has previously been married and had her husband leave her for
(3:05:16) whatever reason so he he's not choosing a virgin in his life and yet he's saying
(3:05:21) that men prefer virgins so it the men who propagate this propaganda don't even
(3:05:27) uh live to their own values and he's a perfect example okay let's let andrew go when i say the
(3:05:35) word stupid i need you to understand exactly what i'm talking about take this
(3:05:41) [ __ ] above me who claims that my argument was that i wanted to have a
(3:05:48) virgin which wasn't my argument but rather that if you were to go to most
(3:05:53) men including me and say "would you prefer the same woman with less bodies or more bodies?" or more bodies shut up
(3:06:01) it's my closing or more bodies they would tend to prefer the woman with a lower body count this was demonstrated
(3:06:08) in the poll angela or i'm sorry lauren uh once again straw man me done at this
(3:06:14) entire panel has no idea what she's talking about now nina i don't i don't you know like we're always going to go
(3:06:20) back and forth because she's a blood sport debater and so am i we've been throwing hands for a long time online
(3:06:25) and we're going to keep on doing it it's brutal blood sports we've done it on the crucible for a long time and it's going to continue to happen it was nice to
(3:06:32) meet angela knight but lauren listen unequivocally you are one of the dumbest
(3:06:37) human beings i've ever talked to in my life and that says
(3:06:42) something i've ever talked to it is even though it's very personal it is this closing statement and when you said when
(3:06:50) you said geometry i couldn't make good argument structures based on when i was in school
(3:06:56) i went and took geometry classes that was literally the dumbest thing anybody
(3:07:02) has ever said to me in my life there has never been a thing which has been said to me which was dumber than that what
(3:07:08) was your score in geometry then lauren since he went after you personally i will give you a quick response go ahead
(3:07:14) what was your score in geometry then oh my god i can't believe you just doubled down i can't believe that you just
(3:07:20) doubled down i don't think you did very well because i don't think you're good at logic structure i'll say i did i did
(3:07:26) dogs and geometry i like see math math is for nerds all right anyway
(3:07:32) let's uh let's move on to the after panel and read a few super chats uh
(3:07:38) appreciate everyone for the support uh salutes to the chat panel thank you thank you thank you if there is a super
(3:07:44) chat that's very demeaning to one of the guests i will not read it but i still appreciate you guys donating give it to
(3:07:49) me you can read it men are generally virtuous and forgiving would you would you single women on panel be open
(3:07:55) turning to christianity repenting for your sins uh question for the girls i guess um that's a [ __ ] [ __ ]
(3:08:02) statement um yeah you think that christianity is like what like female or
(3:08:09) positive for women like [ __ ] you you're an idiot all right oh wow
(3:08:15) i don't understand if this person read the bible dude if this person genuinely wants women to be prevented from like
(3:08:22) expressing themselves sexually then why isn't he promoting all women become muslim and cover themselves in tarps
(3:08:30) why christianity why stop there why allow us to show our hair why wait a
(3:08:35) second why is that the argument why is that problematic we need to repent for our i have nothing against christianity
(3:08:41) but he's saying that like in order to be virtuous and like non promiscuous and
(3:08:47) yeah christianity wouldn't be the most extreme i guess that would but why would
(3:08:52) that be the requirement though lauren yeah but hijab rules the sexiness of a woman come on i don't understand how
(3:08:58) that would be why is why is being a muslim the standard for virtues i don't understand it's why is being christian
(3:09:05) more preventative of promiscuity than christianity christianity allows women to show their hair to show more skin
(3:09:12) it's not as repressive for women so if you're saying that women need to repent
(3:09:17) for their sins because like promiscuity is a sign of showing your face is promiscuous lauren that's weird that's
(3:09:23) the first time i've ever heard that i i've been very tempted looking at all this hair and faces i never heard that
(3:09:29) before showing your face is promiscuous bye lauren andrew you're being pretty big brain stuff big brain stuff
(3:09:36) is that why you had uh is that why you had your wife turn off her camera
(3:09:41) can't even figure out how to work a laptop and he thinks he's big i'm just kidding we we love you rachel i don't i
(3:09:48) don't have a laptop what are you talking about your desktop just [ __ ] up yeah
(3:09:54) my desktop crashed oh no wow that's never happened to anybody in the history of mankind during a debate i always
(3:10:01) hoping so hard totally just looking for anything all right anyway why don't we just accept the fact that most religious
(3:10:08) and chast people want chast is he trying to say chastise chasteed or chased i'm
(3:10:16) not sure what does that mean it means like um like having chastity like being
(3:10:22) yeah chased oh it means it
(3:10:31) reluty keeping to yourself keeping uh tight it come uh but like having like a
(3:10:37) trusty belt is i don't i don't think anyone's disputing the religious people watch
(3:10:43) if you want to date another religious person right that's kind of what they're asking like if it's a religious person
(3:10:48) chase means reserved it means reserved that's what it is that seems i don't have a problem with that having chity
(3:10:55) exactly i don't think no see how i didn't put the word in the definition and you did a lot of times if you go to
(3:11:02) oh my god you go to a dictionary old jump the verb form of jump so apparently
(3:11:10) you've never opened does the dictionary does the dictionary say the dictionary means to jump does it does it say jump
(3:11:17) jump means to jump is that what it says if you open the dictionary and you look up jump thing it'll say it means to the
(3:11:25) verb form of jump oh you mean a reference to defin yeah i know but the definition
(3:11:32) which is what i said you're making her dumber will it reference a defin i'm shocked
(3:11:38) just keep calling me dumb because i'm higher educated than both of you and you guys can't handle it
(3:11:43) you paid money for certificate i just i think that's why she's so mad
(3:11:48) she paid all that money for a certificate to tell her she was smart and it was a lie
(3:11:56) man that education's really serving you i can tell she's so educated i am i have
(3:12:02) a law degree dumping me i will come to my wedding i have a degree in psychology

(3:12:14) come oh you are taking it to the next level okay let's bring on uh
(3:12:22) yeah imagine being a christian and calling someone dumb and going i don't need to imagine it i did it multiple
(3:12:28) times shut the [ __ ] up jeez nina you seem upset why don't you

(3:12:48) bring on a few people uh from the panel probably go for another 15 20 minutes i actually wrote down some questions as
(3:12:53) well that i was going to ask but let's first go through the people uh okay ashley how's it going hey how's it going
(3:13:00) i just want to say i love you angela angela how are you doing

(3:13:21) cold [ __ ] i love it andrew and cannot cannot wait out of you tomorrow night on
(3:13:27) this very subject alex be a compliment coming for me okay ashley you love me come on i do love you
(3:13:36) you know that and you said that the first time i debate a chick like it's
(3:13:41) always brutal seriously so guys the very first debate i ever had in my entire
(3:13:47) life my entire life let alone youtube it was with this [ __ ] this [ __ ] right
(3:13:53) here i at one point during the debate rachel goes rachel goes "what the [ __ ]
(3:13:59) is this your first debate?" and i said "yes actually."
(3:14:06) your lashes look beautiful by the way ashley thank you so much it was actually it was actually really
(3:14:12) funny because um ashley was like "well you're full of yourself and very pretentious." and i was like "well you
(3:14:18) need to put a bra on and brush your hair." and we like going back and forth it was really funny and then at the end
(3:14:25) it was the infamous like i do have great tits thank you you should never have to put a bralless or flawless in my opinion
(3:14:33) [ __ ] yeah dude yeah brows are for people who want to hurt their back for the patriarchy let
(3:14:40) them free keeps them perky too i do agree
(3:14:46) pull your titties out the easier it is for me to get to where i'm trying to go the better uh what's up nick how you
(3:14:52) doing man hey not too bad you guys hear me yes perfect okay perfect perfect
(3:14:58) perfect are we going questions from everybody that pops in or you going to do some
(3:15:04) like lifts or what no i'm post-workout right now i think i'm done you're going to do a thing in a gym and you're not
(3:15:10) going to do any lifts not today not today it's the it's the normal stick but not right now can i get like like a like
(3:15:15) a one like like a a barbell
(3:15:20) oh no just like i want i want you to lift something of some size nina are you
(3:15:25) ovulating yeah there we go i got something of some size i wanted you to put something big
(3:15:33) in your hand and i just needed something to be lifted so it didn't look like it was a green screen juicy okay what was
(3:15:40) your question yeah i well it's a it's a it's a question and and a statement i guess i just wanted to say i think it's
(3:15:46) really cool bpf that like um you defied the norm in so far as deciding to marry someone uh who i assume previously had a
(3:15:53) body count coming out of like a previous marriage i think that's really cool of you because i think that generally speaking like men of character chaz if
(3:16:01) you will basically live their life based on um their own understanding of the world right like the what they observe
(3:16:08) and the decisions that they kind of like reap out of it you know what i mean so if you meet a woman that you think is
(3:16:13) beautiful and of good character that will make a good wife for you you pick them you don't base that off of a
(3:16:18) statistic only an idiot would do that right that's something called ecological fallacy when you apply a broad statistic
(3:16:25) to all individuals like we don't make decisions that way so i think it's really cool of you to do that and i'm really happy for you guys that you you
(3:16:31) know you didn't make a stupid decision based on a statistic and lose out on your you know like if you want to use soulmate your wife whatever that was a
(3:16:38) really nice way of putting our points i genuinely appreciate that you explain what something is after you say it
(3:16:44) because it it helps i'm being dead ass great that was beautiful i'm a
(3:16:51) that was like a nice way of saying and my point but like in the nicest possible way in a way it's like
(3:16:59) why would you why would you rely on body count as a reason to value a woman when
(3:17:05) you could actually meet the woman and see that she's very valuable despite
(3:17:10) whatever her previous history is and she would make a great mother based off attribute attributes that you notice
(3:17:16) from her from interacting with her as opposed from trying to dig into her history and seeing how many dicks she
(3:17:21) sucked as yeah exactly and and like biblically like we even have the example of mary magdalene right who was a
(3:17:27) prostitute and becomes one of jesus's most devout followers she had character she had faith and that was more important than go
(3:17:33) okay wait i i i i'll jump in on this andrew you muted i'm not sure if you're in i do think that uh nina and to a
(3:17:42) small extent lauren you are strummanning the opposition um i don't think they're
(3:17:47) saying that body count is the only thing that matters and that's what you should uh focus on or that it's like the fact
(3:17:55) that she has more dicks in her which is makes her less suitable i think what she's saying i don't think it's a straw
(3:18:00) then i think that's actually i think it comes down to uh and your biggest is that not your point i think a
(3:18:08) lot of them are saying that it's about uh risk mitigation like lowering the risk at the end of the day if a girl has
(3:18:14) a body count of 100 she's more likely to be highly novelty driven she's more
(3:18:20) likely to have novelty yeah which means she's seeking like the next dopamine high the purple but why would you base
(3:18:27) anything on probability when you're when you're meeting these people oneon-one so you get to make these determinations
(3:18:34) about their characteristics and their
(3:18:39) i'm honest i think that you're a dumbass if you can't tell a girl is like like probably got a high body count because
(3:18:45) she she likes novelty [ __ ] she like i i think mostly they're pretty upfront about these type of things no i mean
(3:18:52) first of all i think that uh it depends so if a girl senses that you're the kind of guy that really cares about it and
(3:18:59) she wants to have a relationship with you she has every incentive to lie or at least minimize it significantly okay so
(3:19:05) men do the same thing sure but it doesn't change the fact that yeah i agree that men do that i'm just saying
(3:19:11) that women oh my god your dog is so we're discussing women right now so yeah it's like it's like about risk
(3:19:16) mitigation you don't have a crystal ball you don't know what actually the girl's true intentions are there's a lot of
(3:19:23) things you can go off like is she does she seem like she's loyal does she seem like she's is this really gender based
(3:19:28) though it just seems like that goes on both sides well let's let's be straight we mitigate
(3:19:34) we make mis uh risk mitigating decisions on the basis of investigation right and a a really weak level of investigation
(3:19:41) would be looking at a statistic that's not like uh involved with anything else about the person a really high level of
(3:19:47) investigation would be you date the person you sus out their character you see what their values are and then you make decisions based on that like that's
(3:19:53) why why we date people right like even if you want to come back that's why we court people is your parents are trying to figure out if this person seems legit
(3:20:00) if they're worth worth your while or whatever would you have married kyle if her body count was 200
(3:20:07) um if if her body count was 200 now i'm i'll be nuanced about it if her body
(3:20:12) count was if her body count uh was 200 and she had had some kind of like uh
(3:20:18) figurative not literal come to jesus moment and she was like you know i think i was kind of like chasing like crazy whims back then and i was engaging in
(3:20:24) behavior that like wasn't super safe for me but i've kind of changed i've seen the importance in uh like delaying
(3:20:29) gratification then i'd be like all right yeah you learned something from your walk on this earth and i think you're probably better for it but if that but
(3:20:36) if that wasn't the case if she didn't have some kind of come to jesus moment then that would be a dealbreaker for free so in this case the come to jesus
(3:20:43) moment is she's acts super crazy and uh does risk-seeking behavior all the time
(3:20:49) no let's just say that you don't know like she seems cool she seems chill but her body count is let's go more extreme
(3:20:56) her body count is 500 and she hasn't had any kind of come to jesus moment she hasn't realized that you know she's
(3:21:02) seeking validation would you still consider marrying her so somehow so somehow in in this in this crazy
(3:21:09) hypothetical if this didn't generalize to how she acted or how she was in any other way then yeah it's fine but in
(3:21:14) reality it yeah but isn't yeah that's the point is that being that promiscuous changes who you are as a person i
(3:21:21) disagree with you there and i also think there's a glaring like elephant in the room that no one's talked about yet but i'm going to save that one for tomorrow
(3:21:28) no say it say it you can't just drop that what's the elephant tune in tomorrow okay
(3:21:36) what the issue is what is it nobody's going to a good example of what the issue is like why does body count matter
(3:21:43) okay the reason the reason it matters uh potentially is because it come it it's
(3:21:49) correlated with a whole other behaviors that are not suitable for long-term partner like for example being highly
(3:21:55) novelty uh highly novelty driven like uh having validation seeking uh issues like for
(3:22:02) example having some emotional issues there's a whole girls generally don't fault 2,000 dudes unless they have some
(3:22:09) issues unless who has been raped shouldn't be able to have a good relationship with somebody because they
(3:22:15) have trauma that's a total no one gets raped no hold let me let me cook let me
(3:22:21) cook here of course you would make an exception for rape i'm not saying the girl has to be a virgin okay but it's
(3:22:27) obviously a situation where it's um something that
(3:22:32) is different and is a trauma aspect of it where they're obviously more
(3:22:38) vulnerable to a particular situation do you think that that's like a situation that like oh because it's like more
(3:22:44) difficult that that's like a problem or what do you mean why i can't debate women wait but because they were raped
(3:22:50) and they had that trauma they were more susceptible to like sleeping with more men after that experience over and over
(3:22:56) and that's why they're buying or just because they were raped in general i just wanted to clarify they like a
(3:23:01) particular drama and then maybe that they yes i think basically what ashley was saying is exactly what i was getting
(3:23:06) at where it was just like maybe they were now less like like they were
(3:23:12) violated you know maybe that was their first experience unfortunately as it is
(3:23:17) and then they just like were trying to reclaim their own sexuality
(3:23:22) by you know why are you guys just trying to base all of your arguments on the wildest outliers like what
(3:23:31) i know but it's such it's a terrible tactic for making an argument
(3:23:38) well you have not made the best arguments tonight we don't get
(3:23:43) personal of like like what would you guys think of this particular it's a fair hypothetical yeah uh so okay so if
(3:23:52) the girl got raped which is highly unfortunate and tragic and then that
(3:23:57) kicked off her going out and [ __ ] like 300 400 people then yes even though
(3:24:02) it sucks i would be really weary of getting to serious relationship with her unless she has addressed that issue
(3:24:08) which is causing her to go out well i assume she would tell she would have been telling you about so the important
(3:24:14) thing here right is that it would be as a result of the underlying psychology not the fact of the body right so if you're yes body
(3:24:22) if you got raped a thousand times and have a body count of a thousand but that affects your psychology in no way if we want to do all the crazy hypotheticals
(3:24:28) right then it's like okay we're not going to make presumably a determination on the basis of that what we would say
(3:24:33) is maybe like oh my god how did you get raped a thousand times that's crazy it's like how does this even happen where the
(3:24:38) [ __ ] are you hanging where the [ __ ] are you exactly right but that's the point it's the underlying things not the fact
(3:24:44) of the body count that matters i think we all realize this yeah i i agree well i i don't know if rachel and andrew
(3:24:50) would agree but i do agree with that but at the end of the day you don't you're
(3:24:56) making a decision with limited information because at the end of the day you don't know how your girlfriend
(3:25:01) or your future wife truly feels so there's certain things that you have to make a decision by there's an exception
(3:25:07) for every rule are there some girls have a high body count who can make great partners i'm sure there are right but
(3:25:13) again like you're working on limited information and if your choices well andrew andrew wouldn't answer this
(3:25:19) question so may maybe you would alex um what is a high body count um to me i
(3:25:26) would say that a high body count it depends on the age also but if we're saying like my age like you're the same
(3:25:32) age as i am so yes 30s i would say like when we get past i would say like past
(3:25:37) like 1520 gets like up there past like 50 is high and you're aware people are
(3:25:43) in 50 or 15 past 50 is like high past 1520 it's getting up there you're aware
(3:25:49) people are in back chat huh alex people are in back chat if there's some other people in the um there's actually no one
(3:25:56) there oh well there was somebody who wanted to come up
(3:26:02) if it if it'd be cool i want to like pin andrew just a little bit here is that
(3:26:07) right so um andrew i know you want to get a little closer to your mic um okay yeah i'll put
(3:26:15) you i'll put you guys next to each other so you can really pin him there we go great i need to get i i might need to
(3:26:20) get boosted my mic's just really quiet no you sound perfect now oh i'll turn you up
(3:26:26) nina you uh andrew i i know you said uh later on
(3:26:32) in the debate that merely what you were doing was displaying the fact that if all things were equal if we had a perfect like ontological clone of a
(3:26:40) woman and everything was the same except one had a low body count or was a virgin one had a high body count you said like
(3:26:45) that was all that you were saying that most men would pick the low body count or the virgin correct am i understanding that
(3:26:52) andrew yeah i just say i think on average that's true but you you weren't implying that throughout the entirety of
(3:26:57) the discussion right you were implying more than that throughout the the majority of the discussion
(3:27:03) why do you think i was i think you were losing using a lot of loaded language around topics of sexuality i don't care
(3:27:08) about your opinion tell me what it was you're the worst person to talk to conversations are are kind of like
(3:27:14) subjective right so it's about the interpretation of the audience and you're a pretty skilled rhetorician so i i don't think you were unaware of the
(3:27:20) implications that you were making that everyone i don't care about your opinion what's the argument that you have problem with i'm pointing out the fact
(3:27:28) that at the end you said your conclusion was different than the implication of your argument was throughout the entire so i made you feel bad got it you don't
(3:27:34) actually have an argument do you have an argument or not nick i don't have an argument i'm criticizing your argument
(3:27:39) i'm presenting like a counterfactual okay well give me give me the counterargument then not how you feel i
(3:27:44) i don't have a counter argument i'm i'm criticizing your argument you just don't like criticism andrew on
(3:27:51) on the basis that your conclusion was not commensurate with what you were saying throughout the debate
(3:27:58) so that sounds like an argu wait that sounds like an argument so you're saying that my conclusion was not consistent
(3:28:03) with the rest of what i said in the debate can you demonstrate that for us real quick what i'm trying to demonstrate essentially is is bad faith
(3:28:09) not an error in the argument oh it's bad faith got it so you can't but you can't tell me how or what i said which was
(3:28:14) inconsistent just bad faith i i just explained andrew fair i i just i just
(3:28:20) explained right so it's like the conclusion that you said you were merely making is juxtaposed to the implication
(3:28:26) of the arguments that you had throughout the panel right you mean you mean the implication that you drew from it not
(3:28:31) anything that was actually said the entire the implication the entire audience drew and that everyone would draw from the entire conversation that
(3:28:39) the entire because he because because he intuited it it's his feelings literally he's telling me that he felt like i
(3:28:46) meant to say more than i actually said that's his actual decorative statement here big brain stuff
(3:28:53) nick things in your arguments then you didn't back it up in your closing it's not that's yeah it's it was a bait and
(3:29:00) switch right if you want to be technical it's a mott and bailey so you you huh if you know that you're making a m
(3:29:07) and bailey it's bad faith because you're what was the m bailey okay so during the conversation you were saying things
(3:29:13) about how being infidelis and having lots of body lots of bodies is uh makes
(3:29:19) you a bad partner right no never happened okay so let let me get this
(3:29:25) straight maybe i understood maybe i misunderstood sorry clearly you didn't say at any point throughout the entirety
(3:29:30) of the conversation that if a woman has a high body count she is more likely to or in
(3:29:39) general or is basically almost always going to be a worse partner no this my
(3:29:46) argument and you didn't and you didn't support the study my argument was that the more dudes a chick ends up sleeping
(3:29:54) with the less valuable she usually is generally to dudes and does it how does
(3:30:00) and how much reduced her ability to pair bond is right i didn't bring up pair bonding you brought up the pairs no i
(3:30:07) didn't bring up pairing originally brought it up but one of you two did bring it up you were literally you were
(3:30:13) literally pillaring lauren about the implications that's true but that doesn't mean i brought it up okay okay so are you saying that you disagree with
(3:30:19) the prairie vault study and its implications that that you seem to be addressing about it having an impact on
(3:30:24) human uh pair bonding so you don't think that's true no i in fact my argument was
(3:30:30) is that i think that if you look at that vo study especially when it's talking about the chemical makeup of the vos
(3:30:36) that you could maybe make some application here but that wasn't what our dispute was about yeah so but i'm asking you then so what what do you
(3:30:43) think about the study about the prairie rolls i'll send you you're going to have to wait till tomorrow when i have a debate on this with ashley literally
(3:30:48) nick did you know that they actually debunked that by actually studying prayer evils i sent that article to
(3:30:54) andrew so yeah i know i know about the i don't think he knows how to read so um i
(3:30:59) i just so okay so you're saying you you refuse to answer the question about whether or not you think the prairie
(3:31:05) study has well not when i have a debate scheduled with my debate opponent tomorrow literally yeah no okay what
(3:31:13) does this have to do maybe you should go to bed and get some sleep if you're going to be what does this have to do
(3:31:20) with what you claim is the bad faith argumentation due to the implication of an argument i never made nick well so it
(3:31:26) is literally an argument that you made uh okay and what's the argument again that i that you're claiming i made that
(3:31:31) ran through hoes are worse partners worse partners or less desired by the opposite sex i would say it was pretty
(3:31:39) clear that you made both okay well then you just go ahead and show me that clip that you won't be able to find because
(3:31:45) you just lied but that's well why don't we why don't we ask him right now wait hold on let's just ask him right now
(3:31:50) let's just ask him right now whoa may i please nick i don't think though that that would be the definition of bad
(3:31:56) faith so bad i can give the definition of bad faith please do and then explain how what he did was bad faith i'm
(3:32:02) confused on that one i'm not trying to draw i'm dead ass yeah it's so bad faith is very explicitly when you're engaging
(3:32:09) with people in uh discussion or negotiation uh on the basis of deception
(3:32:14) of either them or yourself that's what bad faith is so if you're if for example
(3:32:20) if you can make an argument throughout a debate right that is very big in scope and then at the end of the debate you
(3:32:26) say and so in simply or in in uh okay simply um only this little tiny this
(3:32:34) tiny little uh this tiny little conclusion right that i'll i'll give a good example what i thought was really
(3:32:39) bad faith was when nina was talking about her best friends and she said rachel and andrew but she didn't mention
(3:32:45) me that was really bad faith she and she should be ashamed of herself
(3:32:52) do you guys all love i'm super sorry but i got to go thank you so much for having me on uh everybody catch me on info wars
(3:32:58) 4th hour jones tomorrow i love you rachel i'll ask we love you have a good night
(3:33:06) rachel we love you all right nick do you have any more questions for andrew um
(3:33:11) feisty andrew my brother in christ i have no enemies and i love you and i
(3:33:16) wish that you would um you would change your ways and stop lying to people all
(3:33:21) the time can you give me the the any lies that i've given to people can you get go
(3:33:27) ahead and do that for me nick okay um or you just slandering lies you're just on here to slander so
(3:33:35) would you just are so are you just mad because i blew out your wife in a panel the other day i think you're just mad
(3:33:40) maybe we can maybe we can like you're just mad that not so aerodite has two conflicting sets of values and she got
(3:33:47) exposed as having two conflicting sets of values as a christian you're just mad and so you're coming on here to vent
(3:33:52) that's what i think so i think you're bad faith bro i don't know about that why are you talking about ardite is not
(3:33:59) here i think that wait wait you guys [ __ ] on so i will fight you over her i
(3:34:05) love her why are we talking about her when she's not even here i think the fact andrew that you won't
(3:34:10) let me speak and keep having to like uproorously uh interrupt me is proof that you you've spoken far more in this
(3:34:17) exchange with me than i have nick well so that's because i was asking the question that you keep dodging so then
(3:34:23) so then you're saying that point you interrupt me like you are right now okay go ahead let me ask the question about
(3:34:29) deception right so would you would you extend the definition of lying to any sort of interaction in which you're being deceptive with people
(3:34:34) intentionally deceptive would that be lying uh no there could be instances there
(3:34:41) could be in instances where you could be deceiving intentionally where it would not be a lie for instance a magician i
(3:34:47) don't think a magician i was just trying to figure out a lie to me anytime you're interacting with
(3:34:52) someone uh deceptively i call it a lie so i'll change i'll change my you're not a liar you're deceptive so what i was
(3:34:58) going to say oh man with all the gish capping i can't even remember what i was going to say anymore um
(3:35:04) yeah that you were i remember what your point was that you were saying that i would say that that's mostly i would
(3:35:10) agree like mostly with that nick cuz i was talking with nick i was talking with nick but nick i was just literally
(3:35:16) giving him an olive branch and saying i think that mostly that's probably correct that if you intend to deceive
(3:35:22) it's a lie i could just think of like a couple examples where it seems gray cool so we have a basically similar
(3:35:27) definition of lying or deception i'll just use deception since it seems less muddy so um would you agree uh that it's
(3:35:35) deceptive when you're arguing with someone uh on the basis of i don't know
(3:35:40) say example uh how to formulate uh logical arguments or coherent statements
(3:35:45) or something like that right how how to take inferences and create conclusions out of them and rather than engaging with the inference and the conclusions
(3:35:52) you just say can you explain the three laws of logic what if the person what if the person
(3:35:59) hang on what if the person's previous hang on hang on no you hold on let me answer this question let me answer this
(3:36:04) question okay fair enough sorry so then so then answer this for me nick if the previous statement which led to that was
(3:36:11) in in and of itself bad faith where they say "when's the last time you took x when's the last time you took x
(3:36:16) studies?" so then hang on so so hang on it's not
(3:36:23) so hang on so then you so then you retort you're saying that uh that i'm in the wrong for explaining that that's not
(3:36:29) actually how logic works it's not based on geometry i i never said logic was based on geometry but geometry the class
(3:36:36) has an entire section which is about logic based proposition so if you did poorly in your geometry class it's
(3:36:42) probably because you struggle with logic structures yeah okay and the fact and
(3:36:48) the fact that you don't get that concept is probably because you struggle with logic concept but really quick nick i'm
(3:36:55) just i am curious though because you were you were explaining like would you say this is bad faith would you say this
(3:37:00) is deceitful or lying which seemed to all be tied into that right but and i'm
(3:37:05) just i'm i'm sorry but i'm just an arguer i love to play devil's advocate but did you not come on a panel for the
(3:37:11) specific reason to try to like kind of paint andrew into a corner and and kind of attack him maybe through some
(3:37:19) deceptive measure like because my opinion like i thought you were coming on the panel like engaged in the whole
(3:37:24) conversation maybe bring something more to things but like it seems like you had an agenda from the moment you got here
(3:37:29) and you were being very deceptive and koi about the way you went about it until andrew kind of forced you to admit
(3:37:35) the real reason why you were here so by your own definition of bad faith i felt like you were kind of being bad faith
(3:37:40) and it was just confusing me i again uh being bad as your definition i don't
(3:37:46) really understand it i'm sorry yeah it's actually a really important thing to look up on like wikipedia to understand
(3:37:51) exactly what bad faith means so um me coming in wikipedia the [ __ ] out of it
(3:37:58) oh i'm not sorry i'm not trying to condescend you i was just saying it's like really it was a little bit thank you for acknowledging that it's fine go
(3:38:03) ahead i'm sorry that you felt it was condescending um so you admitted that it was first that was
(3:38:10) condescend let's let come on though you know what you're doing with your language there that's fair go ahead um
(3:38:17) okay so anyway what what i was saying is so it wouldn't be bad faith because there was no deception what i did is i came onto the panel and when i wanted to
(3:38:24) pin andrew on things i said "hey would it be okay for me to pin andrew on some things?" right so it's like if i came in
(3:38:29) and i was just like "hey guys i'm just here to be like "buddy buddy kumbaya man." i just i'm just like you said i thought you said "would it be okay if i
(3:38:35) asked some question?" that's literally no no no i specifically said "can i pin him on something?" and
(3:38:40) then alex moved me up and be like "here this way you can pin him more directly." so yeah i said specifically pin him on some things oh after you had asked no i
(3:38:47) meant when you first came on though and you were like "hey guys can i ask some questions?" and then you were kind of being koi and do you remember like in
(3:38:53) the beginning and you were asking questions and andrew was finally like "what what are you getting at?" like get to the point obviously you have an
(3:39:00) agenda in my opinion coming into a situation having an agenda or a preconceived you know you know what an
(3:39:06) agenda is an agenda is right like yeah so for an agenda for an agenda to be bad
(3:39:12) having an agenda and not getting straight to the point when you come into a situation that could also be seen as
(3:39:18) maybe a little bad faith so i i don't think it's deceptive to come in and say that i want to pin
(3:39:25) andrew on some stuff and then to say that i think your argument is bad faith i don't i don't know that's that's what i that's not what i thought was
(3:39:31) deceptive or bad faith about your behavior yeah but can you bet more than all of us you you were on this soap box
(3:39:38) about 240 now so i don't know i don't know yeah that's more than me that's more than me so yeah alex alex i'm
(3:39:45) having fun sorry that's it's cool um i got trt and deca so you know kind of on
(3:39:51) mute sorry guys i'm on it's cool ashley um again sorry that you felt that i came
(3:39:59) off condescending you wasn't my intention i apologize um holy [ __ ] where were we andrew um you've been trying
(3:40:04) more than angela to be fair nick you're the only reason why i know what condescending means and that's the truth
(3:40:11) you went on a whole ass rant about it and i learned the difference between like being mean and being condescending
(3:40:17) which is how i knew you were condescending just now to give you some credit to give all right
(3:40:23) uh nick do you have any more questions for andrew before we move on to the next thing uh i think it's just going to
(3:40:29) devolve into mumbo jumbo anyway um i i want to talk to ben thorp alex i i'm the
(3:40:36) maybe i'm the only one oh my god do you think you can bench press andrew nick you want you want me to set up a debate
(3:40:42) he's been begging me for the last like week to set up a debate nick do you think you could bench press andrew this
(3:40:48) is a very serious i think i could i think i could bench press press if you're if you're willing to do it i'm
(3:40:54) down set up get my nick yeah you could bench press andrew uh andrew's probably
(3:41:00) over like 230 right now what do you weigh andrew if you don't mind don't make it weird okay don't make it weird nina i'm just
(3:41:06) curious i don't think i could i don't think i could bench press andrew nina wants to see some sweat i weigh i weigh
(3:41:12) 185 pounds yeah nick get my number yo nick get my number
(3:41:18) from tyler and uh text me and we'll set it up okay cool
(3:41:23) i'll just i'll just try to put it together super fast andrew i think that when you engage in a conversation acting as though you have grand implications to
(3:41:30) your argument saying things such as "okay uh women who are ran through have uh an inability to pair bond,"
(3:41:36) referencing the study about prairie bowls and i' i've heard you talk about these things multiple times before this
(3:41:41) isn't the only time uh not even in this single panel hey michael jackson you want to shut the [ __ ] up unless you've
(3:41:47) changed your mind about that so we are listening to nick cook nick start over for just a second ago i want to hear
(3:41:52) this sorry for interrupting i want to ask you a question nick hang on hang on hang on nick nick is talking you can go
(3:41:58) ahead say my panel bro bro add me on discord um okay yeah so even further to
(3:42:03) the bad faith is the fact that right now you're pretending as though these are not your beliefs you're entertaining that these are not your beliefs when
(3:42:08) they actually are i know that they are because i've heard you talk about them multiple times on multiple panels in many situations you say so on the basis
(3:42:15) of empirical uh uh validation through studies like the prairie ball study and you talk about it from a
(3:42:22) uh a sins versus virtue vices versus v virtues perspective from a christian uh
(3:42:27) directionality you do think it is the case that having a high body count makes you a worse partner makes you this that
(3:42:33) and the other thing i don't know why you're pretending like you don't believe that now everyone knows that you do believe that and so pretending that
(3:42:38) that's not what you believe and that it wasn't what you were arguing throughout the entirety of the panel and then saying i'm merely saying that typically
(3:42:46) speaking the majority of men all other things removed would prefer a woman who is a virgin over a woman with a hundred
(3:42:53) bodies i'm saying that is deceptive you're engaging in bad faith that is not correct and i think you should stop wait
(3:42:59) can we put hands up would you rather have your dick sucked by somebody i know i'm like just trying to be somebody who
(3:43:05) has never sucked a dick versus a person i mean it doesn't matter how to be a woman man doesn't matter would you want
(3:43:11) somebody to suck your dick that has no experience versus somebody who does have experience
(3:43:18) i'd prefer a good [ __ ] to a bad [ __ ] all other things remain yeah so raise your hand then i'll take a woman
(3:43:25) with experience wants bad [ __ ] i guess also what fighting i'm not going to put her hands up for a good [ __ ] i
(3:43:32) i want to ask you a question bro final note this idea that women that men hate hoes is [ __ ] [ __ ] bro half the
(3:43:38) rap songs that's [ __ ] [ __ ] we [ __ ] love [ __ ] bro that shit's facts angela don't you don't morning tomorrow
(3:43:46) my love i have like the perfect song for this me huh yeah angela don't you have an early morning tomorrow i can't always
(3:43:53) have early morning but i'm not a [ __ ] and i have to sit this even though i sat through this whole thing and couldn't contribute to [ __ ] so yeah i love you
(3:44:02) i'm sorry i feel all right let's let michael jay ask his
(3:44:07) question and then go i have a question for michael jay though where did he get that super sexy picture of destiny for
(3:44:14) his avatar well you know when you say the night in my house after we you know that's i'm just kidding i mean it's true
(3:44:21) that but yeah it's kind of funny the story i have about destiny is um when i first got my puppies um he was he he
(3:44:28) went to my friend's house i don't know if you know who trump is and um when i first got my dogs he was there
(3:44:37) just like the whole time you know my questionever yeah so i just want to ask nick a
(3:44:43) question about uh you know you sort of uh i watch an aerodite stream like a not so like you guys are christians right
(3:44:50) i'm just like so shocked by so you guys are like in favor of like uh like
(3:44:56) promisecurity like you know women who is you guys who are you referring to nick and aerodite i don't think they're in
(3:45:02) favor of it well you guys are like open to these things like you guys would be okay with like you know homosexuality
(3:45:08) and let's say like women you know like doing only fans and stuff like you'll be okay
(3:45:13) with you guys would be okay with those things right right nick and so i i think basically like our society is fine with
(3:45:20) it so i'm not going to say anything about it basically but like baseline you know like you as a
(3:45:25) christian like would you be okay as a christian do you think you know as a christian as a practicing christian would that be like an acceptable or
(3:45:31) would that like not make you a bad christian at all so here's where it gets complicated um me and erodite are not
(3:45:37) orthodox christian eastern orthodox christians or like catholics right who have like a broad a super easy list of
(3:45:43) dogma um uh we are like non-denominational uh protestant
(3:45:48) christians and so we think that like figuring out what is right and what is wrong is really important to do within a
(3:45:55) cultural context of your society your civilization your period of time and stuff like that really i thought you
(3:46:00) guys said you weren't solo scriptors i don't know what we're not solo scriptor i don't know how these well if you're
(3:46:06) not solo scriptor then how do you know that your interpretation of the bible is correct who's who who do you appeal to
(3:46:12) for your andrew what does it mean who do you appeal to it means it means by bible god the god the father the son and the
(3:46:18) holy spirit yeah i don't i don't appeal to any of the that's solos scriptorer that is solos scriptor so you think that the holy spirit is giving you the
(3:46:25) correct interpretation of the bible right wait no no hold on this is this is a misinterpretation of any of the five solas which i i don't i don't hear to
(3:46:31) any of the five solas um so where do you draw the authority for the bible yeah so
(3:46:36) i already i already told you through through my own revelation uh and uh with god basically and and do you is the holy
(3:46:43) spirit involved in that okay so then that's one of the five solas so it'd be faith alone that'd be
(3:46:48) solid and solos scriptor both of those would be involved in that right no that that would be if i only regarded those
(3:46:55) right so if i thought that so for example with solos scriptor i sorry i don't want to derail the panel into theology but if i was solos scriptura i
(3:47:02) would say there is no other book there is no other text it is not okay for me to accept any other what other text and
(3:47:09) book do you use then what do you mean for your christianity the book of for
(3:47:15) example and lots of teachings that come out the book of enoch how do you know it's canon can can we not get into a
(3:47:20) religious that day this is like ultra boring well it's not it's not actually ultra boring right because the thing is
(3:47:26) is that the question which was asked to nick is you know these values that you have you said that you don't believe in
(3:47:33) any of the five solas so where would you be drawing your church authority i i'm just curious what authority are you
(3:47:38) appealing to if it's not through the solas i already i already said revelation i already explained divine revelation but that's going to be
(3:47:44) ratified by the solas what else could you use what else could you use nick well no no i i do not want to get into a
(3:47:51) religious debate i mean honestly i just want an answer to that question i answered his what else could you use besides the solas what else could you
(3:47:58) use just that question yeah go ahead yeah i already said my relationship with
(3:48:03) god like faith you know like solar feed the magical
(3:48:09) that would be through faith alone that so okay the all five all five of them work in tandem all right all right no no
(3:48:16) more religious [ __ ] it's boring as [ __ ] we're all bunch of bjs on my channel we don't care what if we what if it's the
(3:48:22) guy that believes that he makes out with and has sex with god can we talk about religion then alex
(3:48:29) remember that [ __ ] guy i i'll make an exception for that looney t to be clear i don't understand the solos at all uh
(3:48:36) okay well just those things alone but yeah to michael to finish your your question right so i i was saying that
(3:48:42) [ __ ] okay you ask me if it's fine if if we think like homosexuality well i'll rephrase i'll rephrase the question just be be clear so by any standard like any
(3:48:50) keep going no just like simply ask like by any christian standard like do you
(3:48:56) not consider yourself to be like a bad christian that's kind of what i asked by any christian standard like i think i
(3:49:01) think like all men fall short of the glory of god and so i'm not perfect and i'm just trying to figure things out as i go basically so you are admitting that
(3:49:07) you're like a flawed like you are deliberately practicing christianity in a flawed manner no no no so that would
(3:49:14) be like admitting to be like a gnostic or something like that what i'm saying is that i sin and i do things wrong and
(3:49:21) my interpretation is open to error but hang on justin you have to lower the
(3:49:26) volume there's massive background noise where you are if you know if you know anything about scripture if you know
(3:49:32) anything about the bible okay i'm i'm i'm literally going to now have to be like sly rude and redirect like manually
(3:49:38) and like no more religious favorite do you want okay uh michael j do you
(3:49:44) want to ask anyone about anything aside from religion uh yeah i wanted to ask lauren like a
(3:49:52) simple i mean you're like a uh conservative right lauren like you you had like a law degree too right that's
(3:49:58) like quite shocking okay all right um so like what part of like conservatism like
(3:50:04) do you side with like what you like you say you voted for trump or something or like what how are you a conservative basically like how do you differentiate
(3:50:11) yourself from like a a liberal let's say oh in in many in many aspects let's say
(3:50:18) like a destiny person let's say like think of destiny for instance like how are you different any different than destiny i'm not a communist destiny do
(3:50:23) you even know who that is lauren neither is destiny destin it rings a bell but he seems pretty irrelevant so i'll just
(3:50:31) move on a couple times legend straight to politics this is very spicy um i like
(3:50:37) for one i think that the way that we handled covid that's what got me into politics in the first place i'm very
(3:50:43) pro- fir like i'm very pro constitution uh i felt like the government was
(3:50:49) throttling our first amendment rights by involving themselves with uh social media i don't think that we should be
(3:50:56) people's ability to uh talk and uh to
(3:51:01) have the public square are you an antivaxer what destinies in favor of i did not get the co vac i did not think
(3:51:08) the coax was so [ __ ] okay oh you did not get vaccinated wait what i didn't get the only thing you said so far get
(3:51:14) not getting a vaccine makes you [ __ ] yeah there was not enough data
(3:51:20) and also the j&j one was recalled so if that tells you anything like everybody who got that yeah do you do you did you
(3:51:27) actually follow what happened with that i did yeah it was but and then then you would know that it was recalled as in
(3:51:34) like that's generally how it works
(3:51:40) yes if there's an issue with something they recall it for a certain amount of time and then they realize that there's
(3:51:46) no actual like risk that or they have like curtailed the risk that um was the
(3:51:52) issue so they they just this is like the most normal i can't even tell you how
(3:51:57) boring this makes me want to take a nap how boring this project sorry but this kind of this kind of outside of like the frame of my way by the way guys if we're
(3:52:04) going to get into the the jabby stabby i actually got a book okay no wait out of respect for andrew let's not get into
(3:52:11) that uh it won't get your guys's channel banned but it'll get my channel banned
(3:52:18) no you're good we're not gonna get into it i actually have a few questions for you uh do you mind if i ask you a few questions andrew
(3:52:25) uh yeah i don't i don't mind but i do want to wrap this up because we've been going for like four hours we're we're
(3:52:31) going to wrap up and like uh well that's not going to work if i have questions for wait alex before you
(3:52:38) i'm sorry could i allow lauren to like finish answering my question if that's okay okay fine sorry yeah okay so i just
(3:52:44) like asked you to name like how he did from destiny you so far you named one thing like the vaccine i don't believe in global warming i said that multiple
(3:52:50) times yeah um i don't believe i think there's like a lot of
(3:52:57) because people always try to [ __ ] bomb the stream near the end of it so we have to delete it so it's just like i'm
(3:53:02) sorry well though that you are you a vampire yeah hey sorry about that i was
(3:53:09) i wasn't talking to you guys i just forgot to unmute myself on that side i i think there's a lot of evidence to show
(3:53:15) that you're a vampire because the only time i see you at night and you are very wait stop let let's let lauren answer
(3:53:21) the question i want to ask her i want to build a wall why don't we have a strong wall on our southern border i mean it
(3:53:28) wouldn't cost if we gave more ukraine we should be i don't think that we should be giving all of this money to
(3:53:35) ukraine especially because i think that a lot of it is being u given to corrupt hands that are not
(3:53:43) even using it for the purposes of defending ukraine as we've seen what do you think it's being used for
(3:53:49) military weapons have already been sold to the russian army to hurt ukraine even though it was meant to defend ukraine um
(3:53:55) i don't i as for our the handling like as in between choosing between joe biden
(3:54:01) and then trump i don't like the way that joe biden pulled out of afghanistan i don't like the way the current democratic that was trump's plan no it
(3:54:09) wasn't no it was not trump's plan was to get out of afghanistan guys guys guys i
(3:54:16) i i got i just got i got a split so i just wanted to say goodbye
(3:54:21) fantastic thank you for being my best friend yeah boy let's get off politics i love her let's get off politics i have
(3:54:28) respect for andrew and his stream i just i want to ask him uh but politics
(3:54:34) is not involved in the initial topic of this debate anyway because this is going to go for another five hours if we get to like [ __ ] afghanistan uh okay so i
(3:54:42) have a few questions i wrote down for you well you're just trying to leave though can can we just say bye to him no well like i just want to ask him like
(3:54:48) i've literally waited for four hours to ask these questions so first i want you can't leave you can't leave no choice so
(3:54:54) first i want to clarify your position on divorce uh do you think the government should be involved in enforcing who can
(3:55:01) try to leave like no nina let me ask him talk nina he's a
(3:55:07) he he's an adult he can leave if he wants to he said he's down to answer a few questions i won't keep him for more than five minutes so anyway so do you
(3:55:14) think the government should be involved in enforcing get divorced or is that purely something that should be done by the church
(3:55:21) do i think that the government should be involved in forcing people to get a divorce is that your question who can
(3:55:26) get a divorce or do you think that's something that should be relegated purely to the church yeah i think for secularists if they were going to do
(3:55:31) some kind of secular marriage i think that they would probably have to have the state involved for an enforcement
(3:55:37) arm whatever whatever that means to them so then my followup question why is it
(3:55:43) that the government should be involved in enforcing divorce but not enforcing alimony
(3:55:48) i didn't say that they should i said there's isolated cases i think where even the church would probably demand alimony but i think you said that
(3:55:55) generally alimony should not be something that the government should pursue except for small exceptions
(3:56:02) yeah well i mean i don't like the idea of alimony to begin with but i do think that there are except going to be exceptions to that rule um it just
(3:56:10) depends it's situationally based so i think that there could be times where alimony is appropriate uh depending on
(3:56:16) the welfare of the child at least if you're talking about the state and state enforcement well when it comes to the
(3:56:22) welfare of the child it's generally child support right there that's what will kick in we're talking about alimony
(3:56:28) we're talking about for the wife who didn't work or it could go the other way which it rarely does so i guess like i
(3:56:34) don't know like e i feel like either the government should play a role in both so
(3:56:40) i so i don't i don't i don't separate these two things if you're going to have a secularist state right where there's
(3:56:47) there's no religion involved however you want to format secular marriage i don't
(3:56:52) really care it's not important to me because i don't believe that it's real marriage i don't think that you have a
(3:56:58) real marriage so i don't really care how you structure it right i i think that marriage is sacramental i think that
(3:57:04) it's an actual sacrament so from my per purview if you're talking about the church and church enforcement i think
(3:57:11) that the church may have some isolated examples i don't know what they would be off the top of my head where maybe they
(3:57:16) would allow there to be alimony and i'm sure that secularist would have some standard for that for whatever framework
(3:57:22) they had for divorce as well or marriage but it doesn't it doesn't sound
(3:57:27) sorry alex i was very confused i'm it doesn't sound like you want just the church to be doing the enforcing because
(3:57:34) the church doesn't have much power when it comes to like forcing people to stay
(3:57:40) together and whatnot aside from like social pressure you want you want no they do they have the power of
(3:57:45) excommunication and that's why catholics often don't grant divorces and why other churches don't grant divorce even
(3:57:51) protestants will exert authority in this right calvinists do it all the time and say that you need to stay together
(3:57:57) inside of your marriage and begin to work things out they do they can exert quite a bit of influence they really can
(3:58:02) i'll just grant you all of that but then you still want the government uh the state to be involved in enforcing who
(3:58:09) can get divorced it's not that i want it or don't want i don't care if it's from a secular perspective i don't care i
(3:58:15) don't consider that to be marriage so i i i want the the state to recognize
(3:58:22) religious marriage and allow the religious marriage to be have the enforcement done through the church
(3:58:27) absent the state i think that that it's possible to do now to a small degree mormons do it to a small degree due to
(3:58:35) some of the laws that they have in some of the regions but it's very very tiny amount of people who are allowed to do
(3:58:40) this and engage in this well when you said you don't like no fault divorce that's a state thing that's not a church
(3:58:47) thing no no fault divorce is also national right so so are you saying that
(3:58:53) for religious people you don't think the state there's no national divorce policy by the way wait so are are you saying
(3:58:59) that for um for religious people the state should not be involved at all in
(3:59:05) divorce and marriage yeah i think that if you're a person who is devoted to your religion and you're
(3:59:11) getting uh married under your religious prescription that i don't i don't see a reason why the state needs to be involved in that yeah honestly what
(3:59:18) everything andrew is saying here makes perfect sense from like a religious perspective like most religious people would just say marriage is a religious
(3:59:25) sacrament first and foremost and the formal legal contract doesn't really matter and like he said like in
(3:59:30) catholicism they don't even recognize divorce there's only anulment which won't deal
(3:59:35) i have to ask you andrew like if the [ __ ] out if the [ __ ] out of you you guys
(3:59:42) debated for like three hours just like [ __ ] five questions and then you can go back alex is going down a down
(3:59:50) a long i'm not even trying to like grill him i just kind of want to figure out
(3:59:58) okay so uh before i was really interrupted by someone on this i'm sorry i'm sorry i accept your apology um so
(4:00:06) then for a what would be the lmus test for like where do you draw the line if
(4:00:12) someone's religious enough is it just purely based on what they claim like hey i'm a religious person uh or is there
(4:00:18) some kind of a limus test like they have to go to church once a week they have to like how do you determine if someone's
(4:00:24) religious enough to have a religious wedding instead of a state wedding the same way that you would determine that
(4:00:29) they can have a marriage now right so the thing is is uh if you're opting in for a church marriage you're going to be
(4:00:35) married by officiates of the church they're going to know if you're a member of the church in good standing then so any anyone who wants to do it can do no
(4:00:43) it's not anybody who wants to do it becoming so this is a purely protestant perspective it's very easy for people to
(4:00:48) just make the claim that they're protestants that's fine okay anybody can do that but in order to be like a member
(4:00:54) of the catholic church or the orthodox church a process that takes many years they um will have to baptize you
(4:01:02) themselves so if you're what's that i i just said and then get confirmed like it
(4:01:08) takes it takes many years it's not it's i mean it's not something that you just go "oh i am." that's not how that works
(4:01:14) so you have to be inducted into the church so there's quite the pro there's there's quite the process for it well if
(4:01:20) you're no you can't just say i want to go have a a religious marriage it's not that's not how that would work well if
(4:01:25) you're saying that for religious people the government should stay out of marriage and should be enforced through the church i agree with you i don't
(4:01:32) think we have any disagreements so then the follow-up question is what about for secular people should they just not get
(4:01:39) married at all or should that be should that involve the state or how should i
(4:01:45) understand um from a secular perspective why secularists would want to have uh maybe some form of protection for
(4:01:51) marriage and this and that but it seems like it's a really bad deal for men who are secularists i'm not exactly sure why
(4:01:58) it is that they would want at this point uh to get married and have state enforcement i really i can't even
(4:02:04) understand what the point of it is i i really don't even understand what the point of it is there's no actual
(4:02:10) grounding or divine command saying you must so why the hell do you do it i don't i don't even get it yeah i mean i
(4:02:17) i think i think i agree with with what you're saying i okay your position is different than what i thought it was
(4:02:22) going to be but you're basically saying you don't actually want the state to be involved you want the church to be involved for religious people yeah i
(4:02:30) just well i just don't i really don't understand and i never have understood why do non-religious people want to get
(4:02:36) married in the first place i don't actually get it you're asking the wrong guy no reason why is it hard to believe
(4:02:44) that people want to uh get married if they're non-religious because you can do
(4:02:49) all of the same we could the state could have the the same exact enforcement mechanisms that you would want
(4:02:55) everything across the board without ever calling it marriage my my family is um i'm personally non-religious but my
(4:03:03) boyfriend or fiance is um religious so he wants to do a religious kind of ceremony so do do you think i should be
(4:03:10) denied that i think that the church would deny you that yeah they would not do that you're just lying but like why
(4:03:17) what do you just lying i think that they they very well may deny you a marriage if your husband was a member of the
(4:03:24) church and you were not they very well could deny you that yeah he does have a point there nina i don't know what else
(4:03:29) to tell you they could point it also depends on what religion that's psychotic there there's no point there
(4:03:35) wait wait i i do want to go back to like a few i just have a few more questions look there are there are some exceptions
(4:03:41) like for instance there's a there's a problem going on inside of orthodox and catholicism where sometimes i'm more
(4:03:46) godly than you are let's be real here where sometimes you have like an orthodox who will marry a catholic woman
(4:03:51) and that can be very challenging inside of those relationships and it takes a lot of i mean it's hard and so there has
(4:03:57) to be a submission aspect and the church basically has to ratify it and say that it's okay to do you have spiritual
(4:04:02) fathers inside of these churches this is not i i you guys only think of this through a protestant prism you go into
(4:04:09) the church and you wave your hands and then you leave andrew do you go to church every sunday two sundays a month
(4:04:16) sunday not every sunday no two sundays a month my church is really far away so i
(4:04:21) i made the commitment to go twice i mean this seems like you're really not very
(4:04:27) argument listen it's not a weak argument in the middle of a michigan winter to try to drag my entire family two hours
(4:04:33) to the closest orthodox church i'm sorry it's not a weak argument i mean it's kind of weak that
(4:04:39) you meant true no offense but i meant it was a weak argument of nenah's to oh
(4:04:44) sorry my bad but it's kind of weak that you didn't want to move too near an
(4:04:50) orthodox if orthodox i was really trying to make an argument that would be between me that
(4:04:56) would be between me and the spiritual fathers of the church who say that hey this is okay to do within the framework
(4:05:03) and perview of your situation between us i want to live near your church members in that community which is the whole
(4:05:09) point of the church in the world that you're trying to why do you think that that would be good
(4:05:15) for my children let him cook let him cook why why do you think that would be your what are you talking about facetime
(4:05:22) every sunday so he's covered he's good okay anyway you have never been inside a church and i know you haven't twice hey
(4:05:30) andrew ask a question really quick on that it's really small it's really small it's really small my god you guys okay
(4:05:37) go ahead well you know what actually hang on hang on hang on nick no you can't ask the question i got to go soon
(4:05:44) alex finish your line of inquiry okay so stop stop stop we kind of agree on
(4:05:51) the uh marriage thing so i'm going to move on to the next thing i want to kind of explore where emotional abuse so i'm
(4:05:56) gonna ask you a few questions if your wife for example doesn't [ __ ] you for three years would you divorce her
(4:06:02) divorce her yeah well what are the circumstances behind it like let's just
(4:06:08) say she chooses not to there's no good reason rachel's like not having it anymore so if rachel were to abandon her
(4:06:15) faith and we were to have tons and tons of interaction with spiritual fathers of our church and under absolutely no
(4:06:22) circumstances was she willing to perform what is part of her duties as a wife then they may grant a divorce yeah wow
(4:06:29) that you make that sound so sexy so your reason the reason hang on hang on hang on well our religion is not about being
(4:06:36) sexy for you lauren barely okay so i have another question what if she insults you every day for three years
(4:06:43) again then we would seek counseling and through especially through the church and we would try to work those problems
(4:06:49) out marriage is hard marriage is difficult it's not easy and the thing is is maybe there have been
(4:06:55) years where she's insulted me every day for all you know the thing is doesn't matter because sometimes in marriage you
(4:07:01) have rough years not just rough months rough days rough years and people grow together through challenge just like
(4:07:07) with friendships friendships are a series of trials before you can call someone a friend otherwise they're not really your friend if you haven't gone
(4:07:13) through anything with somebody and call them a friend you're a [ __ ] idiot because they're not your friend okay uh
(4:07:19) so basically you're saying is that you would seek counseling first and then if it ultimately didn't work out then you
(4:07:26) would call it quits right is that correct i couldn't i listen you're you're misinterpreting this again i
(4:07:31) don't get to call it quits that would be within the purview again of the church i can't just be like i'm done the church
(4:07:38) would take a look at the entirety of the situation before they'd make a determination like that and more than likely they would put down like
(4:07:44) different behavioral programs and things like that to do everything they possibly could to salvage the marriage like most
(4:07:50) churches would okay i mean i don't even necessarily disagree with that that much uh another
(4:07:56) the last thing i wanted to ask you is um you were talking about earlier how there's like it's kind of hard to draw
(4:08:02) the line for emotional abuse right it's like where do you draw the line uh i
(4:08:07) feel like the same thing can somewhat apply to physical abuse like what if you mildly push your wife away when she gets
(4:08:13) in your face would that be considered physical abuse right yeah so you can you can extend this too and be like "what
(4:08:19) about like smacking her on the the rear end when she's not expecting it and it surprises her so she lets out a scream
(4:08:24) right?" it's like listen i think that when you're talking about physical abuse we can draw far less of an arbitrary
(4:08:31) line than we can when it comes to emotional abuse i think it's far easier to make the determination on what's
(4:08:37) being physically abusive and what isn't being physically abusive and i think that there when you're talking about
(4:08:43) consent it's the easiest possible thing to identify like hey i don't like being slapped and you slap her i think i think
(4:08:49) you can identify those situations far easier would i say that there is um like
(4:08:54) that it's even arbitrary there's no system no there's a system for identifying these things for sure would
(4:09:00) i say that finding the line can sometimes be difficult sure but i think it's far more obvious okay i mean that's
(4:09:06) fair i actually agree with pretty much everything you said so we don't even have much disagreement oddly enough uh
(4:09:12) okay i'll kick it off to anyone who wants to i guess say something all right guys well have a great night i'm going
(4:09:18) to get out of here take care of yourself andrew fantastic seeing you as always that's my other best friend we'll see
(4:09:24) we'll see nina at the pearl debate on the 24th right nina yes we will with the just perth things debate if you guys
