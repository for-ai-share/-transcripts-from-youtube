(5:51) cool what about you awesome my name is maddie i am 22 and from utah and then i
(5:57) am a senior in college with a finance degree all right just a student for now which college did you go to u okay and
(6:05) you said you're you have a finance degree or you're working on it um hopefully in the next few weeks it'll be completed okay and you're getting so
(6:11) you're getting your bachelor's in finance yep okay uh do you work do you have a job or um i do real estate part
(6:17) of the time okay um and you you're from utah salt lake city uh-huh okay are you
(6:23) mormon or no not mormon okay but didn't they like rebrand
(6:29) let's get switches okay um they're called the church of jesus christ of latter day saints i am a
(6:34) member oh you're mormon okay well not mormon church of jesus christ of latter day saints but thank you but but it's a
(6:41) sect of christianity yes at least it's mormonism at least what the mormons
(6:46) that's the mormon position we officially changed the name because we want to include jesus christ in the title and
(6:52) make that clear that that's the center of our church well they change okay you
(6:58) changed the name because there was a lot of really bad history associated with mormonism and they didn't want the reputational damage that's that's why no
(7:05) because we chose to make sure it was clear that we made this jesus christ the center of our church no it's because
(7:12) they were diddling little kids in your temple that's that's why and because of that they wanted to change the
(7:18) reputation of the mormon church that's why it happened because in utah there was sex which were marrying underage
(7:24) children and everything else and it was awful god awful what was going on and there's a bad reputation i urge you to go to the church's official website and
(7:32) actually look into what they say about that because they do look up official mormon history and how god awful it is
(7:38) within their various sects you know every religion is pretty awful every religion not like that one um actually
(7:45) pretty bad human sacrifices you know that type of thing we're talking about like the mayans or yeah can you tell me
(7:51) in the 20th century where christians were doing human sacrifice i'm not saying christians are doing that where it was completely appropriate to
(7:57) have uh you know six underage wives and that was in the sect of mormonism not inside mainstream christianity i am
(8:05) seriously urging you to look up exactly what it says on the church's official page
(8:12) and they address all these issues propaganda of the mormon church i'm not here to debate my religion i'm just telling you to look it up on the
(8:18) church's official page if you really want to debate this you can debate it with my father he was a bishop i'm happy
(8:23) to do so bring him on i would be happy to uh to debate the theology of mormonism and the history of the church
(8:30) of of mormonism andrew we had a rage quit before the show let's maybe all right all right like i hit the brakes

(11:05) assistant at an early learning childhood uh center okay great all right well uh
(11:11) we're going to go around the table once more what is everybody's current relationship status uh if you're single
(11:16) how long have you been single and what's the longest relationship you've ever been in go ahead i am single and freshly
() 
(11:23) single so um yeah not okay not too fresh maybe like a month or so but we'll see it but uh yeah i mean that's it nothing
(11:31) too too much to it i mean i have a favorite ex i guess but that's it you know i mean it's real when did it end uh
(11:39) like a month or yeah like yeah a month so you've been single for a month longest relationship yeah longest
(11:45) relationship seven years seven years is that the one that ended the month ago no that was like a high school going to college yeah mhm so your favorite ex is
(11:53) not your most recent ex right yeah oh it is we were just on and off all the time
(11:58) and it was kind of like a thing that it was like why are we arguing so much like we should just kind of if we're arguing
(12:04) more of the time than we're actually celebrating like our time together like might as well just go out you still have your life you're 27 i'm 25 like go
(12:12) experience whatever you want to experience so we could just maybe if it's meant to be you know then that's it
(12:17) but other than that no you know like i can't hold down like i don't own a person so would you take him back now at
(12:25) the moment with like where he's at probably not just because he has things to work on and i have things to work on
(12:32) and not to say like i'm too involved in a relationship when i start dating so like until i feel like i have the time
(12:39) and everything but until then like honestly i don't have the time i just got another dog so i'm just like it's
(12:44) too much it's too much so so wait just to be clear your seven-year relationship is the one that ended no okay that one
(12:51) was a high school from sophomore year all the way until i finished college okay the the relationship that ended a
(12:58) month ago how long was that relationship um on and off-wise we knew each other
(13:03) since 2022 because we would break up and then get back together and then break up and then get back together so like three
(13:09) years yeah so okay so how many times was it on again off again i don't i don't
(13:16) know i don't know yeah i didn't want to drop the bomb but yeah i don't know it was just like we would fight so we would be like "okay i'm done." and it was like
(13:23) "okay then you broke up." like we broke up and then we would go to like no contact and then it was like a we would talk again and then it was like oh we
(13:29) should try this out sounds healthy it was not healthy and that's why you let it go if it's not healthy that exactly
(13:35) time you're actually letting him go this time yeah yeah that's why like yeah yeah and especially just because like i was
(13:41) always um i guess i would say i was manipulated but i was not it's just the point of like i start to have too much
(13:48) empathy and i put their feelings above mine and then when i stop like concerning about myself like i stop
(13:55) concerning about work i stop it's just like that point where i'm like until i feel like you could s like fully provide
(14:02) we're going to get married we're going to have kids we're not going to deal with lies we're not going to deal with issues and we have a very healthy
(14:09) standpoint maybe we'll get back together but until then no okay so uh it's maybe
(14:15) been what a dozen times that it's yeah more than a dozen dozen times 12 here let's okay um mhm so you've only been
(14:23) apart for a month okay so you guys are probably going to get back together then oh no right now
(14:29) we're on no contact fully fully have you been on no contact before uh not like
(14:35) that i guess i guess this time we did it like amicably like we kind of just like looked at each other and we kind of were
(14:41) just crying and i was like i don't need this like and you don't need this either like we don't need this and yeah we said
(14:47) our goodbyes and i haven't looked and he hasn't looked for me so until then yeah you guys will probably get back together
(14:53) but um have you had a rebound no not yet not yet have you before before i mean
(14:59) after my high school relationship i mean i did but then again i was also like freshly like 18 19 so then i was like
(15:07) but i mean my frontal lobe was not developed so i can't i can't blame that
(15:12) okay and uh your seven-year relationship who ended that one uh he did he got
(15:18) somebody else pregnant oh man nice congratulations yeah so that's great did
(15:24) you stay with him no i did not after that after the pregnancy okay but he he cheated on you before then i mean
(15:30) obviously it took nine months so yeah okay um all right uh what about you i am
(15:39) single for the last six months so just came out of a two-year relationship that's been my longest but i've had a
(15:45) couple others that are about that length all right you've had okay uh the so
(15:50) you've had a like maybe two or three relationships that were about two years yeah yeah that's fair okay
(15:58) uh was it two was it three um no there probably the last one was two there's
(16:04) been one 1.5 there's been some shorter ones but but is has it been three
(16:10) relationships four relationships of that length how many oh i would say two two
(16:15) okay who broke up with who in the most recent one um it was kind of mutual there was just some life differences
(16:21) difference of opinion and couldn't really be worked out okay and what about the i guess the first one then um who
(16:29) broke up with who that was that was hard
(16:37) um that one was pretty mutual as well there's it was just really failing and just had to go our separate ways okay
(16:44) uh you've been single for 6 months that was a two-year the two-year relationship though right that was the one where
(16:51) there was a a mismatch of values or how did you frame it um values yeah i would
(16:57) say so just timeline people wanted to get married sooner than others and i'm kind of really big on just finishing out
(17:04) school getting into a career and really getting settled down before making huge life decisions and just not wanting to
(17:10) jump into that so he how old was he um 23 23 and you were 22 or maybe 21 um so
(17:17) he wanted to get married he wanted to have kids mhm and you didn't is that
() 
(17:24) correct um you wanted you wanted to finish college well no you but i
(17:29) understand you want to have kids down the road but at the specific time you didn't all a little too fast for me for
(17:34) the time too fast uh besides his the lack of or the misalignment when it came
(17:41) to timeline as to relationship milestones getting married having kids what uh
(17:50) uh was there any i guess was there anything else mismatch there in the relationship um probably just religious
(17:56) differences okay was he like a muslim or what was he no he's just a different kind of christian and i just we didn't
(18:02) have the same walk with that sure we're both pretty strong in our beliefs so sure what what uh denomination are you
(18:09) i'm just christian or non-denomin okay and what was he he's lds oh mormon okay
(18:16) all right there you go okay there it is it's going to be a mormon conversation we're going to be talking about
(18:21) mormonism tonight folks uh mormonism okay uh but i assume you knew he was a
(18:28) mormon when you first met him right was that like i mean is that a non-negotiable for you like they have
(18:35) to be non-denominational or could they be like catholic could they be orthodox
(18:42) no i just i think we both realize we just really want somebody that's going to walk the same walk with christ and we just view a lot of those things
(18:48) differently with the religious structures and um there's a lot of covenants and things you make in that
(18:54) religion that can be i just wasn't didn't feel truthful i didn't get my answer from god yet so okay i don't
(18:59) really want to dive too much more into it but yeah it was mutual sure wish him the best okay got it yeah okay um well i
(19:09) guess i suppose that makes sense difference of values when it came to religion and timeline uh now when you
(19:15) say that you want to finish out college and get jump started in your career uh do you
(19:21) um have a sense of when you would like to be married and start having kids no it's all up to god's timing i don't
(19:27) really feel any pressure or rush well sure let's say you met a guy today and you guys dated for one year you got
(19:34) engaged you got married a year later you're 24 you finished college at this point you've done some of your career uh
(19:42) let's say your husband is fairly well off maybe he makes $150,000 a year uh
(19:48) would you and he's like "but i want to start having kids now." do you want to continue pursuing your career or would
(19:54) you like to have kids uh at 24 i actually believe you could do both so i
(20:00) definitely grew up with a mother working in the home and that's something that i really admire and so while i think that being a wife and mother is super
(20:07) important i believe at the same time if you want to do both you can i definitely see myself taking a few years off of
(20:13) work as a young mother but i love my career i like finance and so i'm super
(20:18) interested in still pursuing that and remind me your career you said real estate and with finance i know that you
(20:25) can do a couple different things with that um but primarily real estate is your focus
(20:31) so selling houses let's say your husband made $500,000 a year so you didn't need to work uh and he told you "i don't want
(20:39) you to work i want you to stay at home i don't want to ship our kids off to daycare i want you to stay home take
(20:45) care of the kids take care of me take care of the household stop working do you
(20:50) i think that would it would less be of a a necessity i wouldn't need to work but i think that i would en i do enjoy
(20:57) working i do enjoy my business relationship so even if it was 500k i would probably still do the amount of
(21:02) work that was meaningful for me without sacrificing my children what i mean so
(21:08) what amount of work would that be i mean you'd work 20 hours a week 30 hours a week i mean i
(21:15) work in sales so i can i can delegate things as i need to i can run a team remotely and so it's not really like a
(21:21) huge hindrance to me i guess the thought of working so would you have your kids in daycare no nannies nannies yeah i had
(21:30) probably 10 or 12 nannies growing up and it was a great experience yeah is that you think that's god's plan that
(21:36) you have your kids get raised by nannies no i don't think it's the worst alternative i think having a mother in
(21:42) the home at least 80% of the time is super important but i also saw the value of like hey being an active parent is
(21:49) more important than being a present parent 100% of the time so to me a thoughtful relationship thoughtful time
(21:55) with your kids and like really being invested in their lives is more important than being there 105% of the
(22:00) time just there well you can't be invested if you're not there right can i also add something on that go ahead
(22:06) abigail to uh based to go off of your answer to his question do you not
(22:11) believe in a wife submitting to her husband's leadership because if your husband is telling you i don't want you
(22:17) to work and you're going to work anyway that goes against biblical uh teachings
(22:23) wouldn't you agree yeah i think it just comes down to situation every family has to make their own decisions based off of
(22:29) finances based off of you know situation you'll talk to your husband before you get married figure out you know what do
(22:35) we see life looking like together and that's a conversation you can have so i don't think it has to come down to
(22:41) biblical frameworks every single time we live in a modern world that has to account for that
(22:47) it's interesting do you have more on that abigail or yeah i do disagree i think it can be black and white because
(22:53) it's pretty specific in the bible that you are to submit to a husband's leadership you can have that conversation in the beginning and say
(22:59) your husband says you know it's okay for you to work and then like you said situations change thank you situations
(23:05) change and say he is seeing that you're not giving enough time to the kids in his eyes and so now he doesn't want you
(23:12) to work is that something that you'd be able to respect in the man that you chose okay i think it's always like a
(23:17) continued conversation of like "hey like how is motherhip going?" i obviously don't have kids right now so i can't
(23:22) tell you what's in their best interest because they do not exist but down the road i could totally see myself like "hey my 2-year-old like i need to spend
(23:29) more time." like absolutely here here's what we're going to do this is it's a interesting conversation uh i want to
(23:35) get everybody introduced with their relationship but we'll come back to this topic because it's we'll come right back
(23:40) to it um after we get everybody's relationship status so uh what about you
(23:46) i am married i got married in july um so congratulations
(23:52) congrats we need a champagne pop cuz you were on the show before i was like and you were not you were d it was the same
(23:58) guy though right oh yeah of course guys we need a little champagne pop for hey look we got to celebrate but uh okay so
(24:05) you guys are married though right what we are yes we're married yes we're married sweet okay cool um and he's my
(24:11) longest relationship so we met in 2020 when i was in high school okay and stayed together did long distance for a
(24:17) little bit while i was in college and then he actually moved to the area near me and yeah now now we're married it's
(24:23) great he's the best all right cool what about you um i have
(24:29) been single for i think two and a half years now and then my longest relationship was a little bit over a
(24:35) year all right and you said you've been single for two and a half years what the heck
(24:42) uh who broke uh who ended the one-year relationship um it was pretty mutual as
(24:48) well we both kind of just decided was he mormon he wasn't actually mormon are you
(24:54) mormon i'm not i'm the church of latter-day saints the church of jesus christ of latter-day saints
(25:00) non-denominational yeah i grew up in assemblies of god churches and non-enom are you're christian too right
(25:06) yes uh what denomination i go to non-denominational church non-denominational okay got it are you religious or not um i did not like grow
(25:13) up in a religious household so like i explored i mean after that i started kind of just going to christian church
(25:19) afterwards and then i was like i do [ __ ] with it i'm oop sorry i don't mean to say it like that but yeah but i liked it
(25:25) and i it like so then afterwards i just so but i am not like the craziest
(25:30) christian so yeah fair enough uh relationship status me i'm i'm single
(25:36) i've been single i think like three and a half years i say three and a half
(25:41) years technically single maybe like 2.75 years because like we we
(25:49) opened the relationship he was dating actually someone else um but that was cool eye open eye opening i just think
(25:55) um after um and just yeah like after i got ms i think things changed he didn't
(26:02) he didn't leave me at all but i think that i had different desires and i think
(26:08) he had different desires too so i opened the relationship for a year um he you
(26:15) know did that i was cool with it and then after like that one year i was like you know i i think we should just you
(26:21) know break up you're kind of with somebody and you know it's cool so we broke up and and yeah it was it was kind
(26:28) of mutual we both knew it was just a sign of times okay all right what about you um i've been in a relationship for

(28:32) andrew andrew is an orthodox christian so you got any questions he's your guy
(28:39) so uh we have a super chat i'm going to let come through we have uh wait what

(28:58) andrew do you want to do a quick response on that tried to set one up with jacob and jay dyer and he said no i
(29:04) would be willing and and he refused to debate with me on the topic of joseph smith he absolutely refused so that's
(29:11) that if you would like i can later at some time uh give you the number of my dad he is a missionary and he is
(29:17) teaching the gospel so yeah he's not going to come in and debate about jose and mormons don't debate about joseph
(29:23) smith they won't do it i guarantee you if you want to debate with somebody there's plenty of missionaries that
(29:29) would be willing to you can go to any church i guarantee you there won't be a single missionary reach out to and debate about joseph they wouldn't
(29:36) come in on the show they wouldn't come in on the show but they would be willing to debate about joseph smith with you privately if you would like not
(29:42) privately not exactly privately publicly because publicly the position's
(29:47) untenable so they they no because this is a dating podcast not any platform on planet earth they
(29:55) won't do it doesn't matter where we host one v one debates um yeah it doesn't matter where you it could be a
(30:01) theological channel could be anything mormons don't debate if you would like to debate with someone that's fine you can film with the missionaries and meet
(30:07) with them privately or or out in at church or whatever you can do what you want and also i'm just going to make
(30:13) this clear brian i'm not here to debate my religion i'm very set on this so i'm just i respect you i'm fine with that
(30:19) i'm totally fine with that hang on hang on i wasn't even responding to you i was responding to a super chat no i'm just
(30:24) you hang on and then you started to discuss this again with me i didn't even direct it at you so what i'm saying to
(30:31) you though is there is not a single mormon who's in any leadership function
(30:37) for any mormon church who will debate on the topic of joseph smith i know i've reached out to hundreds of different
(30:42) churches they don't do it and i can give you the number of one that would be willing to do it all right all right all
(30:48) right well we'll i just don't want to talk you guys connected i guess after the show sorry and uh and we do we do uh
(30:55) serious one v one debates on here uh not on the dating talk panels but we have a different format so we have this one

(31:28) thank you appreciate it big labby matter okay so that's everybody's relationship
(31:33) status before i and i i wrote down the notes so we're going to get back into some of the conversations about you know
(31:40) mismatches and timelines when it comes to dating wants needs uh that sort of stuff career career like balancing
(31:48) career and family i think that's a really interesting conversation but first we have to get through a few other topics really quick uh mary let me have
(31:54) you pull up the first react that we're going to do the first uh
(32:00) tweet all right so this is a really quick one uh kanye west april 9th leapia
(32:05) place should be governmentissued i had to [ __ ] start beefing with kanye because um leave it there as someone uh
(32:13) only dates women with i find this deeply offensive hash big matter so um i think
(32:18) we ratioed kanye pretty hard on this probably not but um anyways that was just uh a quick little quick little
(32:24) thing i want to bring up really quick uh let's go to the next thing though which is the big thing so we have a i meant to
(32:30) do this last week but uh scroll up scroll up no other way back up so we
(32:36) have ashley st clair here who uh i don't know if you guys some of you are aware she's a uh i was a supposed
(32:45) conservative political commentator primarily on x she gave birth to elon
(32:52) musk's almost a year ago at this point uh i think it was back in may of
(32:59) 2024 so what almost a year ago she gave birth to his was it son new baby into
(33:06) the world uh and she posted this and it went super viral uh and there's an
(33:11) update so but i'm going to give you guys a bit of background for the panel and any viewers who are not privy to it so
(33:18) uh she posted that everyone freaked out on social media there was a whole bunch
(33:23) of uh uh discourse about it tab over to the next one uh so oh well here's the big thing
(33:30) right okay so um she was essentially she didn't get attention from elon musk on
(33:36) valentine's day the man who has multiple baby mamas and
(33:42) um like 14 children and so she went public on twitter on
(33:51) valentine's day or was it the day before i don't know it was valentine's day i think and uh put him on blast and
(34:01) uh let let's pull up that clip that thing though because she got a lot of criticism uh pull it back up so she
(34:07) deleted this but she wrote now mind you she's chasing this guy after for like
(34:12) millions of dollars of child support she filed a lawsuit against him scroll down a little just a little more so she wrote
(34:18) back in 2022 camala can't help herself from bending over for man to get ahead
(34:23) uh scroll back up scroll back up scroll back up and then she deleted the post but we had it um so it's kind of just
(34:30) interesting uh ashley sinclair conservative like she was at the prior
(34:35) to this advising to be uh you know traditional relationships are superior
(34:40) blah blah blah but then she like goes and gets knocked up by the world's richest man uh knowing that he's not
(34:47) going to be like the dutiful like going to take my son to baseball practice like
(34:54) the dude is like involved in the current pol uh presidential administration and
(35:00) he runs multiple billion billion dollar companies so it's just kind of interesting like
(35:08) uh that like this person espousing like trad values but she's like here's the
(35:14) guy she's going to choose to get knocked up with and now he's he like gave her a tesla he bought like a or he's paying
(35:22) for her like $40,000 manhattan penthouse apartment uh paying millions of dollars
(35:27) in child support pull up the next one uh there's other some other damning some other damning tweets uh i think she
(35:34) writes in december of 2023 i think family court is the most evil institution ever mind you she's
(35:40) currently in family court well she brought it to family court uh with elon musk despite him uh having an informal
(35:48) agreement with her paying her millions of dollars uh a year in child support and probably other sort of benefits so
(35:55) but she wants more because she's greedy uh next
(36:00) uh there's no sin as cruel as alienating a child from a parent seeing so much of this everywhere so this is relevant
(36:07) because she's falling for sole custody of the child which seems like it would be
(36:13) alienating towards elon musk disregarding the fact that she chose to
(36:20) get knocked up by a man who doesn't seem like he has a lot of time to you know between his 14 other children his five
(36:27) other baby mamas running multiple billion-dollar companies and also being involved in the uh administration the
(36:34) government administration next oh and then in that little thing at the beginning she said "please respect
(36:40) my privacy." the very next day or some days after she does a uh tell all with
(36:47) the new york post which is a uh kind of a t almost a tabloid uh so she does a
(36:53) sitdown interview in her 40 $40,000 per month uh what's it called uh apartment
(36:59) penthouse apartment in new york with some journalist from the new york post kind of like weird that she asked for
(37:04) privacy but then does this next ah okay here we go so here's the update uh scroll up i'm going to read it
(37:11) so this is from laura loomer laura loomer says "gold digger and professional gaslighter ashley st clair
(37:17) was caught on camera outside of her ritzy manhattan uh condo paid for by her
(37:24) sugar daddy elon musk she's selling her $100,000 tesla she said was gifted to her by elon musk during their romantic
(37:31) relationship she said she's selling it to make up for the for 100,000 in alleged cuts to her child support
(37:37) payments from elon." she took a jab at elon musk scroll down telling people to check the tesla stock adding "i'm not
(37:43) the only one cleaning up after elon's messes." ashley as i reported has hired anti-trump lawyers to sue elon musk he
(37:51) was ordered by the court to take a paternity test so go full screen on that video we're going to okay and then um go
(37:58) uh sorry go to the video tab that's just one up that's not it should be nine or wait one two maybe three actually video
(38:07) tab three uh no it's just above the window
(38:16) tab so the button for the window tab it's just one above
(38:22) it no now you're you're out of
(38:28) f11 it okay here just do this go to look at the scenes in obs there's a videos
(38:35) tab no it's scenes do you see where it says window it's videos tab it's right above it just
(38:42) click it no no no no no no no up just up it yep okay that's it um all right uh
(38:49) full screen the video and then start it from the beginning and then press play i'm
(38:57) selling it because i need to make up for the 60% cut that elon made to our son's
(39:03) childhood why do you think that you did that that's a great question for him
(39:10) you feel like he was sort of like vindictive against you in some way uh yeah that's his operande when women uh
(39:17) speak out when was the last time that you you spoke to him or tried to speak to him
(39:23) february 13th but he's just not not responding to you at all
(39:29) how would you characterize the way
(39:36) you can check the stocks i am uh i'm not the only one
(39:46) [Music]
(39:51) after carvana look at that all right
(39:58) all right pause that cool uh so there's a few more things to go over but i do want to get i
(40:04) guess the panel's opinion on this whole thing uh just one quick note though you'll note that uh ashley stlair she's
(40:12) not particularly famous like aside from her having a child with elon musk she's
(40:19) not famous so she's asking for privacy in this whole matter she i don't know if
(40:25) you guys know like what the kardashians did did or like people in hollywood did when it came to celebrities they call
(40:30) the paparazzi on themselves so this is like a really weird thing for her to do because like there's not paparazzi just
(40:37) like hanging outside her building hoping to get the shot of ashley stlair out in
(40:42) the street she calls the paparazzi on herself and is like "hey come do but
(40:47) like trying to frame it like it's a paparazzi moment." that's kind of weird but so what do you guys think uh of
(40:54) everything and then just also she's getting millions of dollars a year in child support but she needs she she has
(41:01) to sell her tesla to uh cuz the child support
(41:06) payments aren't enough it's at least the tesla component selling it it's just seems like a kind of vindictive move to
(41:13) try to be like well [ __ ] elon basically but um your thoughts um actually i
(41:18) totally agree with that i think that honestly okay look at like for her to sell the tesla and like calling the like
(41:24) paparazzi obviously it was just so elon could see it on tv and be like "she gave away the [ __ ] car i gave her." like
(41:30) and that's really what i think about it cuz i've actually never heard of her the only baby mama i know of elon's is
(41:36) grimes so yeah everything she's doing seems very intentional it's 100% for
(41:41) money for attention attention and if 60% of her child support is $100,000 babies
(41:50) don't cost that much she doesn't need all that she wants more not for the child but for her sure any thoughts
(41:57) really it's kind of just dumb dumb situation dumb like how's it dumb
(42:04) um kind of just the whole thing like you got into that situation you should handle it amicably like maybe she has to
(42:11) involve the press to get some sort of reaction from him which i could understand but you understand the press
(42:16) involvement well maybe if he's really just not paying attention i could see why she would go to that length i'm not
(42:21) saying that i agree with it at all i mean you so prior to well there's
(42:27) another there's a lot of like other components to it but um prior to her going public with this it was handled
(42:33) totally privately he was he's a busy guy i'm assuming he was pretty upfront like
(42:40) and even if he wasn't upfront which i assume he was there's some pretty clear
(42:45) things the fact that he's a billionaire the fact that he's involved in multiple like ceo of multiple companies this is
(42:53) not going to be a guy who's like insanely invol and he wait and he's got like four other baby mamas and 14 other
(42:59) kids like i don't think going into that situation as a woman you can reasonably expect that this guy's going to be there
(43:05) every single day like she made her choice yeah she made a choice to be involved with this guy and then now that
(43:11) she's dissatisfied with the choice she's she she made it's like "oh now i'm going to go public." it was a it was being
(43:18) handled privately i think it's terrible in any sort of relationship situation to
(43:23) like ever go to the press or go public with stuff especially when the guy's paying like hundreds of thousands a
(43:30) month millions a year in child support but you think it's justified no i've never said i think it's justified i'm
(43:37) trying to do it why she would take that step but frankly i 100% agree with what
(43:42) you said okay any thoughts um my take is that this whole dumpster fire could be
(43:48) avoided if people would just stop sleeping with other people that they're not willing to parent a child with um so
(43:55) true true true very true it's true so uh yeah no basically elon i love that you
() 
(44:02) love babies but you need to chill dude you need to stop you need to be be a dad if you're going to make more babies uh
(44:08) you need to be a present father um because that's what our i mean that's what our society pushes this idea of
(44:14) just sleeping around with people and you forget that that creates children um and
(44:20) if you're sleeping with someone you have to take responsibility for the fact that you might be a parent to the child that you create so elon that's for you what
(44:29) anything for ashley though no i mean i obviously we don't know everything that's going on the situation i agree
(44:34) that she's probably trying to take advantage of him and making trying to gain popularity from the situation um no
(44:41) also ashley don't sleep with people you're not willing to have a child with and raise a child with here's another
(44:46) factor i i forgot uh she she had a kid before so this is baby daddy number two
(44:53) i thought you said she was like a christian conservative commentator not christian i don't think she's christian
(44:59) but sheck is on the street not christian but she's conservative i'm actually confused
(45:06) about your your position i wonder if you can if you can help me out here you said
(45:11) that elon shouldn't be with this uh ashley because he's not willing to raise
(45:18) uh a child with her right so he shouldn't be impregnating her well i my my take is basically that you shouldn't sleep around with people unless you're
(45:25) ready to be responsible for the child that you create um but he isn't being responsible for the child he's not being
(45:30) a present father though i mean he's doing he's doing what's expected i i think that it's not great though i don't
(45:37) think it's a great situation that a child is without um their both of their parents living together with them um and
(45:44) obviously that's not always that's sometimes unavoidable um but no in general i think i mean this whole
(45:50) situation would have been solved if they if he wasn't sleeping with a ton of women i don't know how you can put this
(45:56) on elon musk though right he basically just had oh it's on both of them well it just seems like it's on her to
(46:02) me he just he just ordered a prostitute's womb right i mean that's what he did he ordered it up put a baby
(46:08) in there and then said made an arrangement for uh money right i mean that's essentially what happened here
(46:15) and that's i mean that's bad both of them should not be doing that yeah why was st clair an afterthought to you and
(46:21) it was directed well because because he has what 14 children now are any of them the same baby mama do we know they are
(46:30) well this is a rep repeated thing that he continues to do so that's why i addressed it to him specifically yeah
(46:36) but i mean it's not possible so women women are the gatekeepers of sex and they're the gatekeepers of the womb in
(46:42) this particular case what do you mean by that basically well it it means that
(46:47) unless you're in some barbaric nation uh you are not i mean you get to choose
(46:54) your sexual partner right you get to choose who impregnates you right and so does he i mean he's like choosing to
(47:00) he's choosing to have sex with but absent yeah but right but absent womb right elon musk can't do anything and so
(47:06) the thing is well it takes two to create a child he's basically ordering up a womb he's just ordering it up like he
(47:12) would on amazon right he's ordering yeah and that's why i'm saying the mother yeah and that's awful i think i'm not
(47:17) saying what he's doing is right i'm just saying that i don't know why st clair is an afterthought like yeah i guess that's wrong too it's like it seems like to me
(47:24) like the the person who would sell the womb is uh literally setting their child
(47:29) up for failure like some worst form of motherhood i could ever think of you're you're saying that it's mostly her fault
(47:37) no it's both of their faults both of them chose to engage in sexual behaviors with each other both of them took on the
(47:43) risk of creating a child and both of them should have been equally responsible for the child that they create yeah so in this case though they
(47:51) have an arrangement right the arrangement is i'm going to pay x amount of dollars per month on behalf of this
(47:57) child i want to have a child right but i'm not always going to be present for
(48:02) this child that's my end of this contract right that we're about to sign she says "sure that sounds like a
(48:10) wonderful contract." she signs it he seems like he's keeping up his end of
(48:15) the contract here and she's not keeping up her end of the contract are you saying that i don't know much about the
(48:20) situation are did he intentionally want to have a child with her yes oh i did
(48:26) not know that oh yeah that's messed up no that's still i still think it's equally messed up on both of their parts
(48:31) that both of them how could it be if they both they both enter into this agreement right so they both enter into
(48:37) the agreement and he's keeping up his end of the agreement she's not keeping up her end of the agreement well i mean
(48:43) yeah that i'm i'm talking about specifically the fact that they i'm talking about before all of the drama
(48:49) that's happening now they both were in error to intentionally engage in
(48:56) activities that could create a child and not be as present as a parent both of them as they could be for that child um
(49:03) i mean yeah so the after stuff the stuff that she's doing afterwards yes that is her fault i mean obviously we don't know
(49:08) woman who uh wants to get impregnated by a very rich and powerful man for only
(49:14) the purposes of media clout and relevancy is a pretty horrible [ __ ] person i would say that that person uh
(49:22) is is much worse than the even the person who's impregnating her especially since he's doing it only from the angle
(49:28) of i want to so in must mind he's saying i want to spread my seed far and wide it's part of his quote mating strategy
(49:35) right that um he has as much offspring as possible so that his genetics live on and he can afford to do so because he's
(49:41) the richest man on planet earth so he essentially rents out these women's uteruses and they prostitute their
(49:47) uteruses out in exchange for money and they sign a contract with him essentially to do so beforehand and it's
(49:54) like it seems to me like women could really guard against this or he could
(49:59) just stop doing this as well like i don't understand like yes it's bad you shouldn't yeah but why is it a problem
(50:05) for right he doesn't care like what could you do to because there's a child that you have to consider you have to
(50:11) consider that there's this child involved that is going to be without a present father and that is 100% his fault he should not be intentionally
(50:17) creating children that he's not willing to be a responsible parent to so yes their the intentions might be different
(50:23) behind why they are trying to have this child and i will agree with you that maybe she did do it to get famous but
() 
(50:30) that doesn't change the fact that both of them are equally in the wrong because both of their decisions equally impact the child in the same way and the fact
(50:36) that the child is not going to have present parents and that they intentionally creating child to put them in a bad situation so equally well first
(50:42) of all it could equally be the case because in this case he's he's the one who provides the entirety of the support
(50:48) right not her he does so at in in the aspect of the provide role he's at least
(50:54) doing the provide role she's not even accommodating her mother role right she's not even accommodating that right
(51:01) from the outset she makes sure there's not going to be a present father in this kid's life right from the outset yeah
(51:06) i'm not saying she does this via agreement it's like that's insane to me no i'm not saying that she's yeah i'm
(51:13) not saying that now they're equal i'm not saying that oh like she they're equally in the wrong now obviously she's
(51:19) trying to take advantage of him based off of what we've seen um but before all this happened that's my whole point is
(51:25) that all of this could have been avoided if both of them had just not gotten into this terrible agreement to begin with
(51:31) because no matter if she broke the agreement the agreement itself from the beginning was bad and they were both equally wrong to agree on having a child
(51:38) in a situation where the child was not going to have present parents does that make sense yeah i don't i don't disagree with you that both are doing a
(51:45) functionally immoral thing what i'm looking at is who has uh more legitimate
(51:50) irresponsibility or responsibility for the behavior thus far that's what i'm looking at that st clair st clair is 100% in the
(52:00) wrong here um and has been from the from from the outset and that at least he's
(52:06) holding up to his contractual in or she's not even doing that right right no i agree with you now that she is
(52:12) definitely like in the wrong is not doing the right thing i'm talking about from the start this whole thing would have been avoidable if they were both
(52:18) idiots with how they're engaging in activities that create children yeah yeah well i mean but there's not
(52:24) there was never any dispute that that's an immoral category right we're just talking about some some people clearly
(52:29) think it was brought up as though it was st clair was brought up secondary you're like i'm talking to you elon i'm like
(52:35) what why did you oh i was i was specifically talking about how the the behaviors that led to this whole
(52:41) situation could have been avoided if both of them did not do that because he clearly does this with many women um so
(52:48) yeah it's a problem all right um any reactions on i feel
(52:53) like you covered quite a bit so i yeah i think that i agree like a lot of this
(52:59) can be avoided if you wait till marriage anybody here it definitely seemed like an attention stunt um whether it was for
(53:06) from like for elon musk directly or for other women to be like "oh my gosh you
(53:12) know she's such a victim there's so much wrong that he did." and you know okay
(53:19) any anything from you or i think that um ashley sinclair's got a lot of cojones
(53:27) to i don't know to like i mean i'm i'm not in any way in any shape any form
(53:34) near the amount of no notoriety that that she is and i i think that i kind of
(53:39) agree with you in a sense where like he needs to be able to raise the kid too he needs to know that when you know the
(53:45) action's happening but um i i i don't know how like i'm scared to even show my
(53:51) new car wrap to people i i don't even like want people to know what kind of car i'm in let alone where my apartment
(53:57) is doing a interview i i don't know that to me but then again i guess everyone
(54:03) has their own comfort with privacy i i guess do you want to be like baby baby mama number five or elon musk no not
(54:11) after the trajectory he wouldn't do it no he's like "okay i'll pay you $100,000 a month." he's not going to be there and
(54:17) i that's going to be a tough tough deal for me i mean $100,000 a month 100 grand
(54:23) a month i mean i could live off you could stop you could stop the you know the you have to think about the child
(54:29) the courts in there's an innocent child involved in this yeah but yeah but then yeah like there's a kid with no baby and
(54:35) eventually like i'm going to try to like the thing is is if he's not there i'm the type that like is like okay well we
(54:42) need to get somebody there or father there so then he's going to be like why are you picking another one a man to
(54:48) father my son i'm like you ain't here man like i don't know like so yeah uh let's uh go back to the window
(54:55) tab oh here i need you to go back to the other tab like the ashley
(55:03) stlair thing i wanted to finish up on that let me know when you have it uh
(55:10) guys like the video if you're enjoying the stream like the video perfect uh all
(55:15) right by the way brian this is um what this is essentially i've i've always had a theory that i wanted to run by about
() 
(55:22) about st clair in these so i think that there's a lot of women in right-wing media who get very upset because they
(55:29) don't get what they consider to be their due and proper respect at right-wing media from the men and they hatch
(55:35) revenge plots they actually hatch revenge plots in order to get back gets these vaccines at the right-wingers in
(55:42) these media comp and do [ __ ] like this ashley st clair lauren southern i have endless examples of women doing this i
(55:49) wanted to see if what your take was on that
(55:54) uh are these women though you're saying it's conservative women because i don't think ashley stlair or lauren southern
(56:01) are conservative they're part of conservative part of conservative media and at least marketed
(56:07) themselves as being part of conservative media or right-wing media
(56:12) like there's a revenge there's a revenge plot or revenge aspect to it of um of
(56:18) them doing [ __ ] like this sure yeah i mean uh i've definitely seen this before you mentioned lauren southern i don't
(56:24) know if you recognize this name sydney watson uh but these women i are feminist
(56:29) they're they're feminists they're not particularly conservative um i mean lauren southern slept with destiny right
(56:36) allegedly allegedly that's not that's not alleged anymore oh it's confirmed okay oh yeah more than um i don't know
(56:43) how do you how are you going to be like a trad conservative republican and [ __ ]
(56:50) blue-haired leftist destiny that's kind of crazy but um agree and uh yeah i mean
(56:56) she loved him for his brilliant mind ryan yeah but no i mean uh i guess there's been a bunch of
(57:03) uh bunch of uh conservative women fake conservative fake fake fake
(57:09) conservatives we don't claim that anyone can have falling into lust um oh let's uh let's finish up the
(57:19) uh actually wait but no i mean andrew it is a good point like the vindictiveness
(57:24) yeah that's crazy um i don't even really understand and there's a there's a whole bunch of like stuff we we left out like
(57:30) for example i'll just add one other thing uh ashley stlair her communications between herself and elon
(57:36) musk were done on this app called signal and on signal uh you can't screenshot it
(57:42) or i guess maybe it sends like a notification if you i haven't used it but you can't screenshot on signal and
(57:48) it did the chats disappear after i guess you can set it to a c 24 hours 12 whatever so he was communicating with
(57:54) her on signal and she was using a secondary phone taking photos of the conversations
(58:01) on signal with elon musk and where it's like there's an implied there's an
(58:08) implied component of these are going to be private conversations we're not going to be and she leaked all of those in her
(58:15) lawsuit she leaked it to the press and that's super despicable um and mind you
(58:21) she didn't release all the conversations she only released the conversations which which tended to i don't even think
(58:26) they really made her look good or were exculpatory in any sort of way uh
(58:31) released some of them that kind of made her look a little better made him look a bit more culpable so it's all
(58:37) intentional and she i'm pretty sure she was in the hospital one of these
(58:42) screenshots that she took or uh photo that she took from a secondary phone of their private intended to be private
(58:49) communications she took it on the day she gave birth with him that's crazy like she's in the hospital she's at
(58:56) least that's what is indicated she's in the hospital bed and she's like plotting
(59:03) against elon musk like even before there was and this is even before there was
(59:09) any sort of conflict uh she was taking screenshots going way back of their
(59:14) communications when things were good and she was trying to get a second kid she wanted another kid from him it's wild
(59:21) there's a bunch of there's so much to it we're not going to get into all of it let's let me just wrap up really quick on this scroll down so laura loomer uh
(59:29) oh i forgot elon no scroll down scroll down elon musk responds to laura loomer where and he says "i don't know if the
(59:35) child is mine or not but i'm not against finding out no court order is needed." scroll down a bit despite not knowing
(59:41) for sure i've given ashley $2.5 million so far uh and that's the kid's been
(59:47) alive for less than a year and he he's sending her $500,000 a year and then scroll down just a little bit she
(59:54) responds "elon we asked you to confirm paternity through test before i ch before our child who you named was even
(1:00:00) born you refused uh hit show more he gave 2.5 million when the paternity was
(1:00:05) no no no no no no show more okay yeah uh and you weren't sending me
(1:00:11) money you were sending support for your child that you thought was necessary well yeah that's oh my god this girl oh
(1:00:16) okay sending me yes i mean the the mother the mother gets the money uh and
(1:00:22) then he was also paying for a $40,000 apartment he got a tesla i think he was paying for her security details so like
(1:00:30) she was getting the money so i don't know what what that's about until you withdrew most of it to maintain control
(1:00:36) and punish me for disobedience i don't know what most of it means in this context but but you're really only
(1:00:42) punishing your son he's claiming he's still paying her he's already paid her 2.5 mil and he's agreed to pay her
(1:00:49) 500,000 a year i'm sorry she's set for like she could stop working she's set
(1:00:54) for life just off the child support you don't need $500,000 a year to raise a
(1:01:01) kid she continues though by saying "it's ironic that your last effort in court scroll down scroll down it's ironic that
(1:01:08) your last effort in court was to try to gag me while you use a social media channel you literally own to distribute
(1:01:13) derogatory messages about me and our child to the entire world it's all about control with you and everyone can see it
(1:01:19) america needs you to grow up you petulate manchild um and then i'll read this one from
(1:01:24) laura loomer ashley you don't need 3 million to raise a baby this is so outrageous that you had sex without
(1:01:30) birth control you seem to have plotted for many years how to get elon musk to knock you up there's uh just some
(1:01:36) context here there's some screenshots of her old tweets saying like kind of pointing towards her
(1:01:43) like there's like premeditation when it comes to her like pursuing elon musk and
(1:01:49) some uh there's some kind of damning uh tweets that she put out a while ago and
(1:01:54) and also uh messages you're complaining because you want more money for a baby in what world does it cost more than
(1:02:01) 500,000 a year to raise a on a baby excuse me guys not to mention you were making over $25,000 a month on x
(1:02:08) payments how does one person need that much money to survive this is an insult to everyone scroll down you're trying to
(1:02:14) cash out on a billionaire who you baby trapped okay there it is laura loomer doing uh some pretty good reporting on
(1:02:20) on all that uh so is anyone actually falling for her stuff like does is
(1:02:28) anyone on her side i can't see how anyone could be there's there's some there's definitely some but i think a
(1:02:33) lot of people are like they see through it they're they're kind of like calling her out a little bit i think there's a
(1:02:39) lot we don't know too that's true so i think we know enough he know i think that he knew from everything he's showed
(1:02:45) me so showed us so far i can't imagine how anyone could be falling for they must have what she's saying and doing
(1:02:51) they must have done a paternity test or something to confirm the baby was his cuz 2.5 million just immediately given
(1:02:58) like that's just a lot like like i feel like he knows like it's solidified it's his and but yeah that's yeah wow well i
(1:03:07) don't know i mean they got to do paternity test they got to do it might not be his that's a [ __ ] jerry
(1:03:13) springer moment right there um all right well we're going to move on the baby isn't his like that poor child i know
(1:03:19) wait what's that the the poor kid like obviously it's getting monetary money like just money and stuff and it's
(1:03:24) probably going to have some ferrari when it turns 16 or whatever but it needs a
(1:03:29) present father as you stated before i was raised in a very wealthy household but i was very very blessed that my
(1:03:35) father chose me over work every single day but i mean who's so are you is that
(1:03:41) that's more so the fault of ashley sinclair though yeah no i'm not saying it's not her fault i actually think it's stupid of her to sue this dude when
(1:03:48) she's making money and i also feel like it was stupid of them both to have sex
(1:03:55) okay all right we are going to move on to the next topic it's going to be somewhat related to balancing career and
(1:04:02) uh family so uh i'm going to have you pull up that video make it full screen
(1:04:08) on youtube uh this is a clip of andrew you're going to put in the video video tab too for
(1:04:15) this guys perfect uh go ahead and play how do you show respect to your wife oh
() 
(1:04:22) all sorts of ways i basically give her whatever the hell she wants i adore her but here's the thing the reason that i
(1:04:27) do this is because if i say this is what ultimately is going to happen that's the last word in it and i don't even want to
(1:04:33) have the conversation we don't now she may really want to and i can tell sometimes that she really does but i
(1:04:39) don't care because it's my decision ultimately so you don't care about how she feels oh no i didn't say i didn't
(1:04:44) care how she feels i just don't care to have her question my authority autonomy over the marriage you know was there
(1:04:50) initial conversation prior to that or is it just like we're doing this don't ask depends on the context i say more for
(1:04:55) like bigger decisions in life not necessarily like little things even larger decisions if ultimately let's say
(1:05:02) i went home and i said "we're moving to nevada in 3 weeks get your bags packed and i'm not going to have a i don't want
(1:05:07) to hear a word about it you're doing it and that's the way it's going." and you think that's respectful i think that
(1:05:12) ultimately it's my choice and how she shows me respect yeah that's how she shows me respect
(1:05:19) okay let's get reactions uh starting with you truthfully
(1:05:24) honestly if he is like paying for everything and she has no job and like she's a like traditional like wife you
(1:05:32) have no say he literally found you he found you a different all sorts of ways wait what
(1:05:41) highly successful celebrated author who makes a bunch of money oh yeah see yeah yeah yeah just moved to nevada babe it's
(1:05:47) probably a bigger house just move no no no her she oh she is oh
(1:05:53) yeah number one in her category i mean at least um she was for a couple
(1:06:00) of years number one in your category and then you know what i do i take her cash i spend it on
(1:06:07) guns i just take it right out of her hand that her royalties is mine and i go
(1:06:12) spend it on guns i mean you made it pretty clear in the beginning you give her what she needs and what she wants so i don't looking at it hold on
(1:06:22) your thoughts on that um i think relationships are always should be a group discussion but
(1:06:28) biblically like it makes sense um i agree but i always think that you know some kind of input should be appreciated
(1:06:34) and i know at least i would want that in my marriage and if that's how it works for you andrew that's great um but that's kind of just a personal thing
(1:06:41) what but what if there's a uh there's just a disagreement and
(1:06:47) there's been input given from both sides who's the tiebreaker
(1:06:53) the husband or the wife i guess it depends on the relationship that you're in and how you guys
(1:06:59) determine that christian biblical rel marriage what about for yours personally um personally right now i'm not in a
(1:07:06) relationship but i think i i wait wait wait wait be quiet back there please i really value my future husband's opinion
(1:07:12) and i definitely take that into consideration but at the same time i think there also needs to be consideration for everybody's health and
(1:07:18) well-being and thoughts in the relationship and so while i do respect your opinion on that i think there also needs to be you always need to
(1:07:24) acknowledge people's opinions because that's how you facilitate a healthy relationship whether it's biblical or
(1:07:30) not um i disagree i think going into the marriage you can take into account if
(1:07:38) this is going to be a man who's going to take care of you but once that decision is made you're putting things in his
(1:07:43) hands now for you and even for me um picking a man who you know will take
(1:07:48) into account your thoughts feelings opinions is important um like he said if
(1:07:54) there's a disagreement and your input has been given if the man has made a decision you chose him as your husband
(1:08:00) so i would say you have to submit cool i love that's your opinion that's
(1:08:06) great okay um andrew i actually uh well i i i have
(1:08:14) a question for you andrew on this but i i want to get some more feedback from the rest of the guests on this your reaction to the video you're married
(1:08:20) you're christian your thoughts so andrew i think you're hopefully exaggerating how
(1:08:27) you would tell your wife to get the bags and pack up and go uh move somewhere no
(1:08:32) exaggeration no exaggerate well i think you're being a jerk about it then um but soative to be a jerk too you what it's
(1:08:41) my prerogative to be a jerk too yeah well i don't think that's biblical um but um no i do i mean you're
(1:08:47) non-denominational cares what you think is biblical uh no i i'm not a denominational because i follow the
(1:08:52) bible um so so i do i do agree with you though made up made it up 300 years ago
(1:08:57) version of the bible took took books out of the bible but okay go ahead um no um
() 
(1:09:03) but no i think that i i do agree with you to an extent i do think that um the bible does place the husband in a role
(1:09:10) um where he is supposed to have the final authority um but i do think in a help healthy biblical marriage part of a
(1:09:15) husband loving his wife is getting having a discussion and taking her her
(1:09:21) her keep going sorry um um and and taking her input into consideration
(1:09:27) while still making that final decision um but no i think just uh ignoring
(1:09:33) anything she has to say isn't loving i think you should absolutely listen what the clip said what did the clip say clip
(1:09:39) said didn't say that you ignore everything they say well you said you said you the ultimate authority revolves
(1:09:44) around the man so if it did come down to a situation where i said "listen this is
(1:09:49) going to happen and i'm not looking for objections and i'm not looking for input because this is important you just need
(1:09:55) to do what i'm telling you to do." that's exactly what she needs to do well if there's an obviously like if the
(1:10:00) house is burning down yes you should what about if the house is burning down even on a major life decision who is the head of the family biblically who's the
(1:10:07) head yeah it's absolutely the husband that doesn't mean that you shouldn't take input i cannot think of a situation
(1:10:13) where you would not want where you should not take input from let's break
(1:10:18) this down and see if this is correct in a marriage right the body of the church is represented by the woman and the head
(1:10:25) the christ head is represented by the man jesus christ told you to do something would you do it or would you
(1:10:31) go you need to take my input first if it was urgent obviously i would do it right then and there like again if the house
(1:10:37) is burning down and my house if christ told you so if christ told you something to do something can i finish can i
(1:10:43) finish what yeah go ahead so if if my husband says the the house is burning down we need to go now i'm going to get
(1:10:49) up and go and i'm not going to question you that wasn't my question please answer my question here's my question i'm not done talking go ahead yeah but
(1:10:55) you're listen when you if you if you begin to talk to answer a question i didn't ask i am going to cut in and
(1:11:02) reask the question because you're not answering the question i asked you you're just making excuses for talking do you believe that the woman is the the
(1:11:09) representation of the body of the church and that the man is a representation of the head which is the christ head as
() 
(1:11:16) paul lays down uh for his marriage prescription do you believe that that is the case yeah absolutely i think the the
(1:11:22) husband is supposed to be the head but he should still if the man is the head if that is the case if the man is the
(1:11:27) head and is the reflection of the christ head what situation would you ever be in
(1:11:33) where you would question christ it's not questioning i'm not questioning christ
(1:11:38) um well then you're supposed to obey the representation of the christ head as paul says submit to your husbands as you
(1:11:45) would unto the lord and for the record there are times where i i sometimes i
(1:11:50) think it's it's healthy to talk to god and be like "hey i don't know how i feel about this." and maybe pray about things
(1:11:58) and so it's not like always it's okay to ask questions and it's okay to give input like i have a conversation with
(1:12:04) god um and sometimes i i obviously do i follow christ um but that doesn't mean
(1:12:09) that you can't always provide input and i think that it's healthy in a marriage um for your h for a husband to listen to
(1:12:17) their wife um obviously not dispute though we're not disputing that it's that it's healthy or unhealthy for a
(1:12:23) husband to accept input from his wife no i'm not saying you have to accept his authority we're yes exactly we're
(1:12:28) disputing authority so if this is a case husband has authority and refuses input from his wife on certain situations he's
(1:12:35) supposed to have the authority to do so yes or no right no no no i'm i i absolutely agree he does not have to
(1:12:41) accept input he needs to listen he should listen to what she has to say you need to listen you should absolutely
(1:12:47) have a conversation about big things obviously if it's an urgent thing to the head it's up to the head it's up it is
(1:12:53) and at the end of the day yes i don't think it's truly loving your wife if you are making decisions without because she
(1:13:00) might have valuable input to add to the conversation that might um might change
(1:13:06) his decision his final decision perhaps she even does but it's not up to her is
(1:13:12) it right no i i never said it was up to her all i'm saying is so if it's up to the authority if it's up to him and he
(1:13:18) doesn't want input you would have to back that up by your own logic of saying that's rational reasonable and biblical
(1:13:23) no absolutely i have continued to say he does not have to necessarily agree with her input but you're you're saying
(1:13:29) that's why i clarified at the beginning are you exaggerating about going in and telling your wife "we're moving in 3 weeks now let's go." um or is he act are
(1:13:36) you actually going in and saying "hey i think we should move in 3 weeks." what do you think about that and you do not
(1:13:42) have to listen you do not have to listen to her input but you should be loving to your wife and care about what she thinks
(1:13:49) that's not not love listen first of all it's not unloving for you in a position of authority in the head of your
(1:13:55) household to make unilateral decisions on behalf of the wealth of your family or the health and wealth of your family
(1:14:02) that is your decision ultimately is the head the representation of the christ head what you're spouting is feminist
(1:14:07) nonsense you're trying to dispute authority male patriarchal authority within a christian setting by saying
(1:14:14) this the husband ought to still even in a situation where he has unilaterally as
(1:14:19) the head of the household decided what the decision needs to be should still take input from his wife even if he said
(1:14:27) in this particular case whatever the context is i don't want input it's just necessary that we do this
(1:14:33) um if he is the authority if he is truly the authority from your worldview you
(1:14:38) need to respect and obey his authority and submit to it correct i i agree but
(1:14:44) if you are just blind if you're making decisions and being a jerk about it and not and not listening in cases obviously
(1:14:49) again i will reinstate it what makes it jerk behavior what makes it because you're you're making a decision and not
(1:14:54) caring about what she has to say i'm not saying you have to agree a jerk that does a jerk i don't know what marriage
(1:15:00) you're in that you do not have discussions about important life events with your wife why you don't care
(1:15:07) no that's that's what that was your whole argument is that you were deciding you're using an extremist argument so what i'm saying is this there can be
(1:15:14) situations in which you as the authority the ultimate authority autonomy the head
(1:15:19) of your household the representation of the christ head as whom the wife is to obey and submit as she would unto the
(1:15:26) lord okay can say i do not want any questioning of any kind nor to even have
(1:15:33) a conversation about this i simply want my will in this for the family executed but what if you're not doing the lord's
(1:15:38) will hang on your job as a wife is to submit and obey that authority now to
(1:15:43) say that well husbands there's that they should take input from their wives nobody's disputing that husbands always
(1:15:50) almost always take input from their wives they almost always discuss decisions uh between themselves and
(1:15:56) their wives but there could be instances where they choose not to and have valid reasons and it's not for you to concern
(1:16:03) yourself with those reasons you're it's for you as a uh woman representing the
(1:16:09) the christian aspect the female aspect the body to submit to his authority that's the christian that was my whole
(1:16:15) point that there might be valid reasons tracking your point like if my husband said there's a fire we need to get out
(1:16:22) i'm not going to question him i'm going to get up and get out even if i don't see the fire
(1:16:27) definitely not an emergency though i'm talking about whatever it is that he is deciding unilaterally is that important
(1:16:33) that he wants to have zero discussion on his job is to obey what what what are
(1:16:38) situations where he would not want input okay that's up to him okay then let's
(1:16:44) talk not you then i well that's the issue is i'm talking about how hey that might be a sign that maybe you're a jerk
(1:16:50) husband if you're in situ cuz i can't think of any situation maybe it's a sign that you're a controlling wife who wants
(1:16:55) equal authority with your husband never said equal authority you are making stuff up decisions to unilaterally lead
(1:17:02) you when he thinks that he needs to uh uh control and have authority over whatever the situation is maybe you're
(1:17:08) just a controlling wife maybe you're a wife who just doesn't trust your husband's leadership maybe you're a bad christian wife who doesn't trust your
(1:17:14) husband's leadership and won't submit to his authority because if he says unilaterally i have the authority we
(1:17:20) need to do this and you need to obey then your job is to submit
(1:17:26) did you i want you wanted to come in so we'll have you come in what if he's not following the lord's will what if he's going directly against what they believe
(1:17:33) the wife believes is not the lord's will and she's meant to submit to christ before you
(1:17:39) so who's who's the representation in inside of the church i don't know about you but inside of the church we have
(1:17:46) things called bishops priests things like this this has always been the case that a wife could stray away from
(1:17:53) fulfilling wely duties or husband husbandly duties based around various aspects of their christian faith when
() 
(1:18:00) that happens there's a redress of the ecclesiastical authority of the church who often will step in and do things
(1:18:06) like counseling assist with these problems help them remove themselves from error now secularists always laugh
(1:18:12) when you say this but what's so hilarious is they demand the exact same thing they demand a governmental seized
(1:18:18) authority which can step in to assist them with the same types of problems uh marriage counseling psychology uh
(1:18:26) divorce courts uh child child custody agreements they're asking for the same
(1:18:31) thing they're asking for an authority to step in and assist with the moderation of problems which may arise in that
(1:18:37) marriage dynamic christians have the exact same recourse and is it possible that a husband could ask you to do
(1:18:43) something outside of the realm of reason right in some rare instances sure but you have redress there there's higher
(1:18:50) authorities that you could move within the church to get redressed to know that you're doing the right thing or not now
(1:18:55) most of the time the likelihood is is that inside of the traditional churches
(1:19:01) the priest is probably going to say "you need to obey your husband." and a lot of women are resistant to that that's why
(1:19:06) in orthodoxy you see such a split between the sexes in catholicism and in protestantism not so much women are the
(1:19:13) majority but women are the ones who are the most resistant to the idea of the submission to the husband
(1:19:20) you had something abigail or um i mean i think what he's been saying is pretty
(1:19:26) well said when we go back to the original video that brought up this discussion they asked him like "do you
(1:19:32) consult your wife or and he said that i mean he even said just now that he
(1:19:38) doesn't dispute that a man should consult a wife and listen to
(1:19:44) her opinion but he made it very clear that it's situational and if he says that this is what's going to happen and
(1:19:51) i don't care to hear questioning then ideally if you chose a good man and you
(1:19:57) chose to marry this man then if he's if he's not wanting to hear your questioning he's probably got a good
(1:20:03) reason as to why what would be one of those reasons what would be a reason why you place to question that though right
(1:20:11) but i'm talking about how that's an issue on the guy's part like hey why are you not willing to hear input from the
(1:20:17) person that you care about i don't think that's in dispute though so yeah he he already said it's situational but what
(1:20:24) situ can i can we even think of a situation where there would not where there would be a reason not well this is the problem right so think of it like
(1:20:30) you would in the military think that you were in the military for a second and there was a general the general right
(1:20:36) being a good leader is um you know sometimes that's going to require a discussion with the soldiers who are
(1:20:42) beneath your chain of command in order for you to make good decisions based around you know the the various
(1:20:48) executions of what you need to do in the battlefield absent the battlefield things like this but if a general comes in and says "i don't really want to hear
(1:20:54) your opinions execute your your duties and shut your mouth." um you really don't have any recourse against that
(1:21:01) right because he's in authority the question is not this hang on before you before you rebutt about whether or not a
(1:21:07) marriage is this or that we're talking about this from the frame of a christian purview what is the frame in a christian
(1:21:13) worldview right not from a secularist worldview in which your feelings get hurt and so you get mad and you don't
(1:21:18) like doing it blah blah blah blah blah but rather what are your duties to christ and what are your duties to your
(1:21:24) husband what i'm saying is that whatever the situation is right that you would consider rational or irrational one
(1:21:30) thing i came up with is he feels the need to move jobs now perhaps he has a type of wife that can instill doubt in
(1:21:37) him right and he doesn't for this particular case want any sort of doubt she's not a bad person she usually
(1:21:43) reinforces what he says but maybe this decision he just feels like consulting her for some reason not the best idea
(1:21:51) it's h ultimately up to him and his authority and for her to be obedient to
(1:21:56) his claim of authority that's ultimately what a christian marriage is right but can you think of a situation where that
() 
(1:22:02) would be necessary that's the thing like i just did he just gave a situation no like i know the whole like and when
(1:22:08) there's a general and everything in charge but like you're the whole thing that brought this whole up is a situation of specific situation for
(1:22:13) moving now i don't know yeah i well i still don't get why you can't like afterwards like have a conversation i i
(1:22:20) got one i got one let's take her she was in a relationship with a man i know
(1:22:26) there was a component of there was a mismatch when it came to uh mismatch when it came to he was a mormon you're
(1:22:32) non-denominational christian she didn't want to have kids yet she wanted to be boss babe and i
(1:22:39) asked her "well would you continue working if your husband was capable of providing you for you and your family?"
(1:22:44) and your husband said "i don't want you to keep working i'm making enough money to support the family i want you to 100%
(1:22:51) focus i know you want to work i know it fulfills you in some way but we're
(1:22:56) married i'm the husband i don't want you to work i want 100% of your attention on
(1:23:02) our children and the household and me is that is that a satisfactory example no
(1:23:08) no because i think you can still have a conversation about that you don't have to listen to what she has to to the
(1:23:13) input but i think conversation at all yeah if you're not going to listen then the conversation is well i think you
(1:23:19) should i think that's the issue i think you should be open to what you're obviously there are situations where yes
(1:23:24) it's important to make that decision but so let me ask you you're usurping authority from the husband you're listen
(1:23:30) i i want to show you the contradiction your worldview so that you can understand it when you say you the
(1:23:35) husband who is the leader and the authority in my christian marriage who i have submitted to need to do x you are
(1:23:42) usurping his very role as the leader you're demanding him to be so when you say you need to accept x input or x
(1:23:50) thing from me when he says no i do not and in this case this is for the betterment of the household and family
(1:23:55) it is not for you to question if you usurp that hang on you are in what is called the role of satan right you're
(1:24:02) usurping the authority from what you call the christ head the not kidding this is the christian worldview the idea
(1:24:09) that the man is the representation of the christ head in the marriage if you're going against the authority of
(1:24:15) the christ head what is that other than satanic you tell me i'm not saying i wouldn't listen to him i'm saying that
(1:24:21) it's healthy to have conversations about things and okay let me let me ask you this hold on i'll get i know you guys
(1:24:27) are raising your hands i'll get you guys in in just a sec so when you say have a conversation i don't think andrew is
(1:24:33) disputing that the husband can counsel hold on hold on the the husband can
(1:24:40) counsel with his wife get input from her but how many subsequent conversations
(1:24:45) and disagreements and eventually fights do we need to have before the husband gets his will well it doesn't have to be
(1:24:52) a fight it can be a conversation but so here let me let me roleplay this i don't want you to go to work i want you to
(1:24:58) stay at home with our kids okay we can have a conversation about how but but how much do you need to are you going to
(1:25:04) just nag me until i bend to your will no okay but how many conversations need to
(1:25:09) take place i it depends on the can is just one conversation okay yeah as long as there's no followup needed yeah but
(1:25:17) but so what hold on hold on so hold on so what if the determination on my part is i okay cool we i heard all your
(1:25:25) inputs you you made a powerpoint presentation here's why i want to work here's why i want to work i'm going to
(1:25:31) be able to find i'm going to be happier and it's going to be a financial benefit to the family because i'm going to make
(1:25:37) be making x amount of additional money and we can go to the bahamas bl whatever it is and i'm going to listen there and
(1:25:42) sit there i'm not going to interrupt you you can you can give me your powerpoint presentation for why you should be a
(1:25:47) boss babe when i want to have kids and a family and want you to stay at home and i can provide i've listened to it wait
(1:25:53) wait wait hold on hold on hold on i've listened to it i've listened to it and i'm like "thank you for sharing." nah
(1:26:03) no so i say no what's the next step yeah i would respect that absolutely would you
(1:26:10) respect that yeah depending on the case i would what what you what do you mean depending on the case if the husband was
(1:26:16) fully able to provide for my family and there wasn't going to be any detriment to me not working and it would only be a
(1:26:22) benefit to my children then in that case yes i would what do you mean a detriment to you not working didn't you say there was like some greater calling
(1:26:27) fulfillment when it came to you there is fulfillment and i think i would find that later on in motherhood where like
(1:26:33) kids are going to school i could pick that up this is my personal wants it doesn't need to match everybody else in this room but i think that for the time
(1:26:40) being if it was at the greater benefit my kids me being at home and raising them especially when they're young i
(1:26:45) would do it so okay how about your husband says this you're married you have three kids and he's like "nah
(1:26:54) you're just not going to work." maybe he might be like "you know what once they're once they're all out
(1:26:59) of college." how about that are you going to be happy with that i can't tell you no wait you can't tell me no i can't
(1:27:08) tell you now oh you can't tell me now but i am i will be marrying a husband who would be willing to have a
(1:27:14) conversation with me that appreciates you know my thoughts as well and he appreciates your thoughts but like he's
(1:27:19) like i've heard the powerpoint presentation for why you want to be a boss babe i i i appreciate your thoughts
(1:27:26) but my decision is no what then then that's fine we can make an agreement on
(1:27:32) it if it's a b greater benefit like i've said before to me being at home with the kids if the house is taken care of
(1:27:38) financials are good and that's great everybody can live a happy life healthy food in the home able to live a positive
(1:27:45) you know and no it's that's negotiations the opposite of submission is negotiation so
(1:27:51) the thing is is like let me get let me give you like a a very clear-cut example something that maybe uh nobody can
(1:27:58) dispute women often due to hormonal regulation become extremely irrational especially
(1:28:03) when they get very close to certain situations or decision-m right and sometimes right due to that
(1:28:10) irrationality i think it's perfectly acceptable for a husband to do things like say you're [ __ ] irrational
(1:28:16) you're overly hormonal you need to shut up and go away or walk away from this situation that's exactly what you need
(1:28:21) to do and you need to go somewhere calm down and you don't get a say you don't get a say what's wrong with that can
(1:28:28) somebody tell what's actually wrong with that are you going to all pretend that women don't have trouble with regulation
(1:28:33) extremely disrespectful and the way you phrase that is in a way that's totally not okay and i won't even give you an
(1:28:38) answer to that question i think it's so ridiculously phrased it doesn't seem ridiculous to me it seems like the irrationality needs to be contended with
(1:28:45) somehow go ahead go ahead okay so here i would be like "all right so i lived 10
(1:28:51) years of my life out of a bag anyways so i wouldn't care about moving even if it was to timbuktu i don't care but i would
(1:28:58) be like "all right partner while i pack while i pack all of our stuff i want to know i want to know what's what's going
(1:29:04) on why are we moving?" but i'm packing all of our stuff i will do all of it just tell me right now as i pack okay
(1:29:10) all right and you had something go ahead okay so you wouldn't object to your wife going to a leader of your church and
(1:29:15) saying "hey i disagree with my husband on this." and the church leader happens to agree with her well it depends on the
(1:29:22) context if she's going to the church in order to give them idol gossip or uh
(1:29:27) things like this or you know talk about um interpersonal context that's not ba
(1:29:33) if she's going to the church in other words for and saying to them there's something here which is not following
(1:29:39) christianity and that needs to be dealt with then yes the ecclesiastical authority is designed specifically to
(1:29:45) assist with that just like uh in the secular world she smiles as though this
(1:29:51) isn't true in the secular world do you want would you want your uh husband to go to a psychologist in order to like
(1:29:57) gossip about you and run you down and things like that no you'd want him only to go to a psychologist for the purposes
(1:30:03) of trying to assist with some type of marriage where one one partner or the other thought they were being completely
(1:30:08) unreasonable or or you know outlandish or doing something that they weren't supposed to be doing the same exact
(1:30:14) thing would be uh happening under a christian view the idea would be you're not going there to bark about your home
(1:30:20) problems but you're going there to get assistance for things that would step outside of the christian view one person
(1:30:27) i am christian just so we're clear you're a mormon and i'm not going to
(1:30:32) okay well i will okay no you're not for my view you're not for my view you're not but that's fine the thing is is like
(1:30:39) that's fine i'm just saying that even inside of the lds church this is the case even inside of the the church of
(1:30:46) latter-day saints that you have people that you can go to who assist in marriages who assist even in arrangement
(1:30:52) of marriages by the way no not you can go to people well yeah they do they just
(1:30:57) don't do it like the church doesn't go i'm picking you and picking you but what happens is the women of the church do
() 
(1:31:02) matchmaking and they do all sorts of different things with their daughters and their friends and things like this the same thing by the way that women do
(1:31:09) even outside of churches they play matchmaker all the time yeah uh secular inside a church whatever but the point
(1:31:15) here is is that that authority is still even abs inside of your church for you to go for redress if if a partner is
(1:31:23) doing something that you consider to be external to the christian faith doesn't it okay i just wanted to clarify that so
(1:31:29) she does have an option if she does object and doesn't agree if that makes sense well you know well it hang on
(1:31:37) again that's not correct right this is context dependent yeah like i don't
(1:31:42) agree that my husband says i have to do the dishes on sunday it's not what you're going to a priest for you'd be
(1:31:47) going to the priest for something like my husband's listening to satanic music in the garage and it's very concerning
(1:31:53) to me uh something like that something which would be stepping outside of the christian view not to question his
(1:32:00) autonomy and authority over his household that's not what their job is or the ecclesiastical authority's job is
(1:32:05) now there could be extra marital things which they could or i'm sorry marital things which they can assist with uh
(1:32:12) specific counseling things like this which catholics and orthodox have made available for years and years and years
(1:32:17) which does assist with things like who does the dishes on sunday or whatever that is right uh but generally speaking
(1:32:25) you're not going to them for those types of things you're going to them for issues of the spirit all right a couple
(1:32:31) chats coming through here we have lucas lucas says "is it me or is it the obstinence and programming with this
(1:32:37) generation of gals beyond intractable it seems that they're willing to forego highc caliber men for the sake of their
() 
(1:32:44) boss babe ideology." to which he continues in this upcoming message thank
(1:32:49) you lucas for the message he continues by saying "chair 2 you are a pretty a
(1:32:55) pretty and appear to be a wholesome girl i assure you very few high earning high
(1:33:01) virtue men will accept any push back on outsourcing the raising of their kids for me it was a
(1:33:09) non-starter any response there you said you had like 12 nannies
(1:33:14) or something growing up yeah just through the years through the years are your are your parents still together or yeah very much so okay very happy family
(1:33:22) lots of kids yeah okay um so you do you want to have nannies
(1:33:29) like for your kids or um i wouldn't mind if the situation had to permit it's something i'm totally
(1:33:35) let's assume how about how about this situation let's assume he earns enough money for you to be able to stay home
(1:33:40) but he doesn't earn enough money for you to be able to have a nanny uh are you
(1:33:46) fine with that um it's if i was staying home and taking
(1:33:52) care of the kids the nanny right exactly if i was working part of the time in that case i would have a nanny i don't need a nanny just for fun just to go out
(1:33:58) shopping like that would be done but if let's say you did meet a guy who was okay with you like working whatever he
(1:34:05) was fine with it it wasn't i'm sure you there's plenty of men who are not going to be as uh as hardline on some of these
(1:34:12) uh components uh but uh you said you'd
(1:34:18) want to work like part-time right mhm okay so maybe you work like 20 hours a week so you have the nanny 20 hours a
(1:34:24) week or something like that uh wouldn't you say though that even then that that
(1:34:32) time would be better spent with you like the kids would be better spent with you versus some stranger i mean it would it
(1:34:39) would obviously always be preferable to be with me their mother over a outside person sure i'm just saying if the
(1:34:45) situation came down to it and i had to be working or if it was more advantageous for our family as a whole
(1:34:51) we had a reasonable discussion about it here's the pros here's the cons i'm seeing a little bit more pro not even 20
(1:34:57) hours but i could see some benefit to me still working yeah i was thinking about this the other day when it came to
(1:35:02) daycare or having nannies or whatever and uh the the cost of daycare is so
(1:35:09) exorbitant at least well i guess it depends where you live here in california for example you're going to spend for one child between $2,000 and
(1:35:17) $3,000 for uh for one child maybe they give you discounts if you have two kids i don't know the details but let's say
(1:35:23) for two kids it's going to cost you $5,000 and i'm thinking like okay that's $60,000 a year um say the wife makes
(1:35:31) $70,000 like some maybe she makes $60,000 a year that doesn't the math
(1:35:37) just doesn't make sense to me for a woman to make $60,000 a year and push
(1:35:42) all that money to a daycare when she could just stay at home now i understand that women cannot well and these numbers
(1:35:48) are highly charitable sure and i think the average salary in the us for a woman's 40,000 40,000 a year and so and
(1:35:55) you look at the average daycare cost it's the average is at least 10,000 the average is at least 10,000 yearly oh
(1:36:02) yearly okay i was talking in california per month for dayare 20 it's two two to
(1:36:09) $3,000 a month so you're looking at well the california average is 19 i think last year 19,000 a year on average so so
(1:36:18) even if you have the offset of an extra $10,000 because of the inflationary cost of living so starbucks pays there let's
(1:36:25) say $20 an hour instead of 15 is still eaten up in the daycare cost you're really only getting an extra 20,000 a
(1:36:31) year after taxes if you're lucky right it's like what what are we doing here it seems silly and and even even if the
(1:36:39) even if your wife is out earning whatever it is that the cost of daycare is there is still the i i just think
(1:36:47) it's always optimal to have the mother taking care of the kids okay cool
(1:36:53) you make instead of outsourcing to canuela not to mention the amount of abuse that we see inside of this these
(1:37:00) various programs oh yeah the mother's definitely yeah the mother's definitely going to take cuz i've heard some horror
(1:37:05) stories from like some of these daycarees you know they don't change the diapers as often as they should um there
(1:37:11) there's like a bunch of kids the kids are constantly getting sick because they're they're all the germs and
(1:37:17) everything and um you know i think the kid is going to do the best when it's
(1:37:22) the mom solely exclusively uh taking care of the kid not daycare not nannies
(1:37:30) uh so i don't know that's my thought even if she's making $100,000 a year i still you know and you know let's say
(1:37:37) the day uh for you have two kids she's making $100,000 a year she's got to put the kids in
(1:37:42) daycare that costs 50,000 she's left with 50,000 also you know i was thinking
(1:37:47) about this the other day it's really it's actually a big leap of faith when you think about it um you wouldn't just
(1:37:53) hand your kid to some stranger you just met and say "hey watch my kid for 8 hours in a day." but you put a lot of
(1:38:00) stock in the fact that the state inspects these daycarees even though that's a joke right it's like they can
(1:38:05) hide all sorts of things from the state and often do and it's like it's a huge
(1:38:10) leap of faith to even go down that path to begin with just to hand your kid over to somebody else to watch for hours and
(1:38:16) hours and hours of their day who knows what they're filling their head with who knows what's going on there it just seems like a terrible idea ultimately
(1:38:23) yeah we have some chats coming in here we got john smith john smith sorry for the delays guys sorry for the delays the
(1:38:29) bear versus man convo proves women are horrible at risk assessment and they can't decide what they want for dinner

(1:39:48) thank you man jason castle donated $200 appreciate it man this is feminism people all the women on the panel
(1:39:55) claiming to be christian you can't be a christian and be a feminist at the same time feminism is antithetical to
(1:40:02) christianity feminism is evil oh okay well going around the table jason cassell thank you so much for the uh tts
(1:40:08) really appreciate it are you do you consider yourself a feminist no not really yeah no no depends on how you
(1:40:15) define it but no okay no i would say yes but then if i was asked by a feminist
() 
(1:40:22) sometimes they don't think sex workers can be feminist so it depends yeah okay what do they i'm anti-feminism
(1:40:28) anti-feminist okay same here anti-feminist yeah anti-feminist anti-feminist um all right we'll come
(1:40:33) back to the feminist conversation later can i ask um a quick question sure i was just for for chair three what do you
(1:40:40) think i i want to know this uh what what do you think submission means what does that mean to you submission like
(1:40:47) submission to your husband like yeah respecting your husband respecting their final decision making um i mean
(1:40:53) obviously it depends on the situation but um typically trusting their decision- making then you're deciding
(1:41:00) when to be submissive and ultimately you're not being submissive what do you mean yeah well hang on hang on hang on before before you you get into it i just
(1:41:06) want to make sure that because i think it's a fair a fair criticism that you know if you're not defining terms do you
(1:41:13) think that submission means obey uh yeah yeah i do yeah obey and uh
(1:41:20) obedience part of submission okay okay so then uh why would you i guess
(1:41:27) following that line of reason would it be submissive or nonsubmissive to question
(1:41:34) your husband's authority on a major decision well it's it's not that i wouldn't listen it's that i would want to have a conversation about it and i
(1:41:40) think most decisions can like i don't think there and obviously there's some situations that we addressed that there
(1:41:46) does need to be an urgent decision that should be made by the husband i think most decisions most major life decisions
(1:41:52) can be talked about before they they're decided on i agree they i agree they can be what i'm asking you to reconcile is
(1:41:59) your definition of submission being also obedience obeying trusting doing and
(1:42:05) reconciling that with the idea that there needs to be x to plate you if
(1:42:11) there's even a major decision which happens can you tell me how that fits your definition of submission what sorry
(1:42:17) what do you mean by that like you're asking what you question if you question the authority of your husband by
(1:42:22) demanding a conversation with something he doesn't want to converse about rather wants you to be obedient in how does
(1:42:28) that form to your version of submission how's that you being submissive i i wouldn't necessarily question and and
() 
(1:42:35) and demand a conversation i think just in general it could be uh problematic if
(1:42:41) a guy is not seeking discussions with his wife though because the the initial
(1:42:47) example that was brought up at the very beginning in the clip was you're moving in 3 weeks and you come in and you say
(1:42:53) that i don't know why you could not immediately after have a discussion hey how are you feeling about this instead
(1:42:59) of coming in and just throwing it on perhaps what do you perhaps you can but the idea here isn't what can or you can
(1:43:06) or can't do the idea here is what is submission what is not is it actually submission if he says "listen i know
(1:43:14) that you probably have all sorts of protests here but i don't want to hear them i want you to do instead execute
(1:43:20) and obey what it is that i'm expressing to you that i want done to obey my will." is are you then submitting or not
(1:43:27) submitting by saying no we need to stop right now and have a conversation about this i'm not saying i would stop and say
(1:43:33) "hey let's have a conversation." i might want to and you can submit to your husband and i can also still think that
(1:43:38) he should have a conversation with me about these things yeah sure you can you can say that you think that he should
(1:43:44) but then the idea there in the clip then when you had a criticism you just
(1:43:50) countered the criticism because you said no i'm not saying that i would actually question it that is submission and that
(1:43:55) is exactly what i expressed submission is obedience right yeah no i'm saying i i would i would absolutely submit to
(1:44:01) that but no my my issue is this idea that guys should not be just making
(1:44:08) decisions sorry i know you want to talk um as uh as a person who doesn't care
(1:44:13) what they have to say all the time i don't think that there's decisions where that's obviously there are some but in in general that's not necessary so i'm
(1:44:20) just pointing out that if a guy is is doing this on things that can be talked about that that's an issue well then
(1:44:26) that's countering the trust that women should have in faith in men no i is that inside of a christian marriage you're
(1:44:33) supposed to have trust and faith that your husband's leading you correctly and trust in faith in his authority when you
(1:44:39) say things like this like "no he needs to stop and have a conversation with you he needs to justify it to you he needs
(1:44:45) to make arguments to you for it." things like this you're actually countering the view it's actually what it what it does
(1:44:51) is it inverts it it inverts the view of what submission is actually supposed to be it's obedience to your husband it's
(1:44:58) really inside the christian view at the purview of the man to make these decisions and that i think women should
(1:45:05) be reinforcing who are christian women they should be reinforcing that idea of trust in your husband trust in your
(1:45:11) husband trust in your husband and they don't instead they resist submission at
(1:45:16) every level because they think it's mean they just quote mean you know and it's like that to me is absurd
(1:45:22) i have a question for you andrew so oh question is is it submission if like let's say you know you're like "oh we're
(1:45:29) going to move to the husband goes "oh we're going to move to nevada in 3 months." and then the woman's like "okay
(1:45:35) i'm going to pack both of our stuff now i just need you to tell me like why as i'm packing i don't need like i'm going
(1:45:40) to do it either way i just need to know the reason." is that cool is that submission well actually this is a great
(1:45:46) question i understand why you're asking i'll let me back to make sure yeah yeah let me repeat it back make sure so he
(1:45:53) says "look we're moving in just a couple of weeks right you need to pack everything up." and you go "okay i'm
(1:46:00) packing it up honey." right now tell me why we're doing this again yeah right got it so here's the thing let's say you
(1:46:07) do ask that question he says no why well is it legal stuff no no no don't say no
(1:46:13) just say he says no what is your role in
(1:46:18) the christian view he says you say "can you tell me why?" and he says "no
(1:46:25) i would be scared if it was was it legal like if it's another woman i don't care we'll pack up and leave i don't whatever." so he points out he looks at
(1:46:31) you and he says "no it's not legal." oh there you go then then i'm like "okay like then whatever." okay if it's not legal then cool they're not like
(1:46:37) skipping town you know yeah okay so then you're going to assume okay if it's not legal then whatever like i don't care i i've lived out of a bag for like a 10
(1:46:44) years anyways yeah yeah i got it but what i'm saying is that within the purview of submission right the fact that you even had to ask him if it was
(1:46:50) legal is also moving against your idea of trust really it's moving against
(1:46:56) trust in the authority of your husband well then wait wait question i got a question for you what if we what if i like pre-planned like you know in in in
(1:47:03) advance in a sense where i was like hey on a date with him you know before we
(1:47:09) were even married and i was like hey if you ever needed to skip town it can you
(1:47:14) just let me know my rule my rule is to let me know is it legal involved if it's legal involved then i so so you mean you
(1:47:22) set down some boundaries that you had within before i even get married yeah early on yes right do you expect him to
(1:47:30) adhere to the boundaries that you i would hope so yeah cuz i'm going to adhere to all mine no oh that's not submission what no way that's right come
(1:47:38) on we have earlier it's a mission it's a mission and but can he just tell me if
(1:47:43) it's legal or not the mission is obedience to your husband but what about the law view obedience to the hut listen
(1:47:50) i'm going to i'm going to try to explain this the best way i can inside the christian view even if
(1:47:56) pre-marriage you had some discussion about whatever it was right but here's what is put on the man's shoulders in
(1:48:03) the christian view the he's he's to put his life before the lives of his wife
(1:48:08) and before the lives of his children he's to accept all danger they get the lifeboat right he doesn't get the
(1:48:15) lifeboat he stays behind right if they're marooned on a desert island he's the one who gets eaten and not them okay
(1:48:22) if there's any sort of defense of the nation which comes up his duty and obligation is to go and take care of
(1:48:28) that problem by the way these are not the only duties that they have that's just some but starting the starting
(1:48:35) level of security at the home starts with the husband and the head who is the husband he if they are providing those
(1:48:42) duties and providing those resources inside of the home as they're supposed to do inside of the christian view right
(1:48:49) their wife's job is to submit to the authority if he's holding up his end
(1:48:56) right his end of the authority here you're supposed to be holding up his end of the authority period okay well
(1:49:02) question last one um so what if we made this thing where i was like okay if we
(1:49:07) ever need to skip town move whatever could i just be like this and then if you do this then i know it's not legal
(1:49:14) yeah you so i'm not an accomplice like you can put in the request for any high sign that you would want okay i'll just
(1:49:21) be like this and if he goes like this i'm like listen you can put in a request but that's the opposite of submission to
(1:49:26) make a man that he obeys your authority really a husband is not obligated to
(1:49:32) obey the authority of their wife the opposite is the case i just went like this and you know legal like is this but
(1:49:38) what if they respond with this you know their authority right it's their authority even if it was legal i'd be
(1:49:45) like cool do i get a lawyer like like you know to help us i gave you my high sign right i would i would want to know
(1:49:51) if it was legal if it was legal it's fine i'll just get a lawyer that's fine i just want to know do i make the call you don't have any trust or faith in
(1:49:57) your house i do i do trust i just want to know if it's legal if you have trust then then trust
(1:50:03) but the legal why that makes so much sense because the idea here is that if the man is taking the head the christ
(1:50:10) head here right the same way you're supposed to trust and have faith in christ is the
(1:50:15) same way you're supposed to trust and have so i'm going to assume it's not legal yes you're supposed to
(1:50:21) i just thought as long as it's not an eagle i'm cool i don't care i can live anywhere think
(1:50:27) about how easy it would be too to trust in a man who's taking on the role of dying for you like like your husband is
(1:50:34) supposed to love you as christ loved the church and christ died for you so i think it'd be really really really easy
(1:50:40) to take in that submission role and take on that submission role when you know that he loves you enough to die for you
(1:50:46) yeah i'm cool but he knows that i'm going to do this at one point wait i i do have going around the table on that note the man being willing to die should
(1:50:53) your boyfriend so you've been dating for a year uh should your husband be willing
(1:50:58) to die for like take the bullet for you yeah yeah yes yes
() 
(1:51:05) yes only if he wants to be yeah okay quick answer willing to yes willing to
(1:51:11) yes yes yes yes okay um and then if a guy wasn't willing
(1:51:17) to like what's your response like if he's like "nah i'm not doing it." then why are we dating why why was he dating
(1:51:24) okay he's got to give his life he's obviously not fulfilling that role not fulfilling that role no i think like as
(1:51:29) christians we should be willing to take the boat like i'm willing to take a bullet for most people like i i think
(1:51:34) that it's pretty selfish but in this situation it sounds you said man the man should take the bullet yeah i mean i
(1:51:41) think everyone should like i would take a bullet for my husband too yeah me too yeah i would too yeah but like that's
(1:51:48) actually beating up your own biblical role again right so here i would take a bullet the reason the reason andrew's
(1:51:54) mad at me for wanting to die for my husband look i'm not i'm not i'm not even trying to beat i'm beating up the ideology not you personally i just the
(1:52:01) things that you're saying here don't make any sense even from the christian role that would be incorrect he should
(1:52:06) step in for all threats towards his family that is his ultimate duty unto
(1:52:13) not only fulfilled to his family but unto god he's supposed to you don't have to yeah but i want to and here's why you
(1:52:20) shouldn't even hang on here's why you shouldn't even because the idea is you're a caretaker for the children this
(1:52:26) kind of thing right these roles are set for a specific reason right but all of
(1:52:32) this usually comes down to just a poultry excuse for egalitarianism and refusal to submit to your husband's
(1:52:39) authority and so you come up with all sorts of crazy mental gymnastics to try to justify egalitarianism why we need to
(1:52:46) be more equal why the husband and wife need to have a fair shake against each other no the christian view submission
(1:52:54) of the wife to the husband husband leads and is in authority just look that way okay
(1:53:02) um wait i had to follow up on this well i guess my confusion is there was a
(1:53:09) lot of push back on this whole oh the man like you don't you
(1:53:15) don't want to be submissive to your husband but you want him to die for you
(1:53:22) like does that seem like a fair like the least a man can get i suppose a christian man can get is if he's willing
(1:53:28) to die for you if he's going to provide if he's going to protect you should at least obey him
(1:53:35) that's a way better that's like way better tradeoff i just have to obey you
(1:53:40) have to die [ __ ] if if somebody gave me the choice y'all none of y'all are going to date me after this if i have to obey
(1:53:47) some if the choice is okay brian you got to obey somebody or you die i think i'd
(1:53:53) rather obey somebody now i'm going to get called a beta male whatever fine i accept i accept the beta male title i
(1:53:59) will survive and whatever uh i think the woman should take the bullet because i'm better suited to you know after uh
(1:54:06) breastfeeding i'm better capable maybe breast like breastfeeding
(1:54:12) the women are better at can you milk a man i don't think they're actually
(1:54:19) doing male males do males do lactate our males do lactate yes that's true you can
(1:54:24) milk a man wow that is disturbing you have to like do like drugs for it it was a big to-do because there was a a group
(1:54:31) of the te's who pumped themselves full in fact of
(1:54:36) various hormones so that they could lactate more and there was a big controversy over what the quality was of
(1:54:44) what they were putting out there and when it was scientifically tested it was not good interesting yeah um i don't
(1:54:53) know man i just think [ __ ] sorry the guy's got to take a bullet for
(1:55:00) you it's a fair trade-off you got to you got to listen to what he says you got to listen to him somebody in your chat said
(1:55:06) "man milk." that's so gross oh my gosh that sounds like a an actual drink yeah
(1:55:12) we have uh we have some chats here on youtube side we need to get through oh andrew uh this is rachel wilson's wife
(1:55:18) maybe we need a little cameo if she's feeling up to it um andrew listens to me often but what's best for him is what's
() 
(1:55:24) best for me therefore in situations where he doesn't want my input he isn't obligated obedience to your husband
(1:55:31) husband is obedience to god well put rachel this is interesting because i never seen this type of dynamic so to me
(1:55:38) it's like i'm looking at through a bush like just kind of peeking around like "oh this is cool." like you know i never heard of this stuff before yeah that's
(1:55:45) that is andrew's wife rachel we have slave my slave andrew's andrew's slave
(1:55:52) yes uh beat and cheeks here chained to give birth specifically to the stove she's not she is allowed to come out on
(1:55:59) tuesdays and wednesdays for sunlight you know i'm a very vampire is she a vampire or or not a vamp because of the sunlight
(1:56:06) never mind okay yeah i give her some sunlight come on yeah of course uh bean cheeks i love how these boss babes
(1:56:11) parenthesis feminist want a s not a man being a boss babe is not only uncchristian-like but against the
(1:56:17) christian patriarchal view of maintaining a healthy family dynamic why would you feminists want another person
(1:56:23) to watch over your kids does anybody want to do a response to beat and
(1:56:28) cheeks morg morgan do you want sorry did i it's not maddie my bad right maddie is
(1:56:34) right sorry i got the m's got me all [ __ ] up maddie my apologies i feel like we've talked about this a lot of
(1:56:40) times um doesn't need to be recapped again but yeah if it was i think you
(1:56:46) know the situation it would benefit the kids to be at home i didn't need to work in any sense of the word i would stay at
(1:56:53) home and work i've said that okay you're people people are going to have different opinions on that and that is
(1:56:58) 100% okay with me boss babe it is wait sorry boss babe it is what do you mean yeah they can call me that it's great oh
(1:57:05) okay all right he follows up by saying "i will ask the famous andrew question if men are supposed to be providers and
(1:57:11) protectors to not only their family but to provide society something significant as their duty what duties do women bring
(1:57:19) what do you women bring to the table are you virgins if not actually this is a
(1:57:25) this is a fantastic question brought up by beaten cheeks so he's asking this and maybe we can go around the panel on this
(1:57:32) if it is the case that men's job in society is to uh procure resources so
(1:57:38) think of it from a bird's eye view the whole world's a bunch of waring tribes which is exactly what it is between
(1:57:44) different nations countries things like this if it's the men's job to procure resources refine resources distribute
(1:57:51) resources and it is their job to defend the nation and defend the social security inside of the nation so the
(1:57:58) security of all people what is the equal role that women have in society to that
() 
(1:58:03) that's his question it's a good question for the panel yeah why don't we start uh we'll start on this side what do you
(1:58:10) think um i don't know to be honest i believe like from the dawn of time we're we're gatherers they're hunters we're
(1:58:17) supposed to just be at home and i i mean i love traditional wives i actually
(1:58:22) abigail respect i want your life i want the life um honestly yeah because once i
(1:58:28) get married and i have kids i truly believe because i chose that man and i already know his mindset enough to like
(1:58:34) choose him so i need to trust him because obviously that's why i chose him i would not just get with the man that i
(1:58:39) did not trust so i mean i mean yeah blind's eye view like i would just kind of respect him all the way because i got
(1:58:46) to know him before we before we married hang on hang on chair one um what about to the question though what is the equal
(1:58:53) responsibility to society that is equal to down for men the equal responsibility
(1:59:00) that women have to that responsibility they laid out that men have what is the equal one that women have
(1:59:08) i guess just keeping the home keeping the home keeping the kids keeping everything stable on that side all right
(1:59:13) let's get somebody else go ahead what about you um i would say it's nurturing raising a family um teaching kids good
(1:59:20) principles good morals teaching them about the bible i think that's really important um as well as provide not
(1:59:27) providing sorry don't blame me like cooking taking care of the home as well but overall just ensuring the well-being
(1:59:33) of husband kids and the home um but men have to match up to that life as well
(1:59:39) and i feel like that's also something in modern day that we do not see a lot and so okay in a perfect world it's easy to
(1:59:46) talk about here's the line let's divide it but it's not always that way true uh no i agree with you guys that motherhood
(1:59:52) is absolutely an amazing gift and something that is obviously essential to society obviously not every woman though
(1:59:59) is called to be mothers some women never get married and that doesn't mean that they are less valuable to society um and
(2:00:06) so you can absolutely still provide amazing value to the world um as a as
(2:00:13) not a mother but i do agree that um motherhood is a amazing thing amazing gift so motherhood would be what you
(2:00:19) would say would be the equal the equal responsibility all the way to the the uh
(2:00:25) responsibility socially that men have well i think that women who aren't married or don't like or just don't have
(2:00:32) kids yet i still think that they are they have a responsibility to give value to the world in other ways um what are
(2:00:38) those ways i'm curious like just like for instance my job right now is working full-time in the pro-life movement um
(2:00:44) and i think that's something that is i've i've been called into wait that's still based around motherhood though
(2:00:49) wait i have i have a quick question on that if your husband said "hey this
(2:00:54) advocacy that you're doing is fantastic but like you want to have kids right?"
(2:01:01) okay and he said "well once you start having kids got to cut that out i love
(2:01:06) i'm hey i'm a pro pro-life husband whatever but your work in that
(2:01:11) organization must cease do you listen to him i would if he absolutely like made
(2:01:17) that decision but no my husband uh supports me continuing my work when we
(2:01:22) do have kids because i love what i do and it's great oh that's important work sure
(2:01:28) um i think that women are like i believe that
(2:01:33) you're supposed to live as you're not going to get married and because some people aren't called to be married and so i'm going to live in that way but
(2:01:40) then let's say i do get married well hang on hang on hang on i just i'm i'm really sorry to cut you off i don't mean
(2:01:46) to do this the only reason i'm doing it is because i'm this is a very specific question which is not tailored to you
(2:01:53) individually as people as the person so i'm not asking you this question so i'm
(2:02:00) going to repeat the question men's job in society is to procure resources
(2:02:06) refine resources distribute resources every single job skill that you look at
(2:02:12) will provide this for you right 95% 96% in many cases 97%
(2:02:20) uh things like electricians things like uh oil rig operators things like construction workers right the people
(2:02:27) and people who go out and actually procure resources all basically all men almost all of them this is seems to be
(2:02:33) what their social and societal role is that is the case they are to protect society and provide resources on behalf
(2:02:41) of women and children in society what is the equal social duty that women have to
(2:02:47) that i think caretakers and nurturers whether that's in their communities in the people that they're around in their
(2:02:54) churches and then for those men okay quick answers if we can
(2:03:01) um i i mean i guess i i didn't really grow up in a nuclear family so i i don't
(2:03:08) really like i'm just i you know this is it has nothing to do with you asking
(2:03:13) prescriptively what do you think socially women i i guess they they could i did babysit when i was younger so i
(2:03:20) would say that yeah i guess they could nurture the my yeah it has nothing to do
(2:03:25) with me so never mind that wouldn't that wouldn't pertain but uh okay so mother show and back to motherhood nurturing
(2:03:31) okay yeah i would agree um having kids and making sure that they're raised properly
(2:03:37) with a good moral um moral foundation and then that also educated properly
(2:03:43) because the education system is next um proi providing relief and nurturing and
(2:03:49) stuff um i just got it we prepare the men for war me next yeah well said i think an ideal society has nuclear
(2:03:56) families everywhere so fostering a nuclear family raising your daughter up and the way that we have described women
() 
(2:04:03) need to be and raising your son up in the way that you described men need to be would be so then we essentially have
(2:04:08) universal agreement almost on this panel that the social obligation for women is
(2:04:13) based around motherhood and raising the next generation of children in some way participating towards that that seems to
(2:04:20) be the social obligation that you universally agree on however here's the problem in all western nations and
(2:04:28) almost all nations in fact but the west particularly we we are not at
(2:04:33) reproductive rates to replace our society at all we are under replacement across the board which means that women
(2:04:40) are failing in this social duty of both reproduction and the assistance towards
(2:04:47) the ends of reproduction which by the way all of you on this panel agreed is the social equal of what men are
(2:04:55) providing for you however men are upholding their end which is the
(2:05:00) procurement refinement distribution of resources and protection of society so i want so my my the question boils down to
(2:05:07) this since this is the case what do you think should be done that's not based
(2:05:12) around um well actually we'll just make it easy what do you think should be done so that women go back to this idea of
(2:05:20) role of reproduction in society in this social role of being matrons in raising
(2:05:26) the next generation since you think that's the social duty go ahead uh so i actually had a video i don't know if
(2:05:32) you've seen this interview ever but you know you two bono is very political and he he did an interview i think a couple
(2:05:39) years ago and it said uh america is a very young country and it hasn't developed its um structure quite yet and
(2:05:47) i i don't know if i'm saying that correctly but this interview is online and he talks about how america is so
(2:05:53) young that it's going to eventually within the next like hundred years develop its you know that type of a
(2:06:01) structure like its family structure its political like it each country is every country this uh this issue the
(2:06:07) reproduction issue is in the entirety of all western nations regardless of age
(2:06:14) the united states though right united states all of them including the united states okay it do you but there's other
(2:06:20) nations which are which okay so longer the united states my understanding is the united states actually the oldest
(2:06:26) current established nation with its original established do uh foundational
(2:06:32) constitution it's the oldest one that exists currently i see the pilgrim vibes coming back now other nations other
(2:06:38) nations which you could argue are older like england or the uk things like this sure but they suffer from the same
(2:06:44) reproduction crisis re really they they i know japan yeah and all all of them i i think i think there's a there's just
(2:06:51) um i mean i have a personal opinion about japan in a sense where i feel like there's a lot of shame um in you know
(2:06:57) for the man to carry uh a lot of the you know the how do i say it um financial
(2:07:04) and and responsibilities and if anything happens then you know it's dishonored to
(2:07:10) him and and how do you just so so why won't women fulfill their social roles
(2:07:15) wh why won't women fulfill their social roles yeah their social roles of reproducing having the next generation
(2:07:21) and assisting with that which is what all you agreed is the social role that women have if men are going to be
(2:07:28) providing all of this for them i think there's a communication issue like between not not between like me and you or anything but there's a communication
(2:07:34) issue between men and women like i think that like and this is just i've taken
(2:07:39) you know polls from my own life and also you know other situations and scenarios that i've heard of and seen just over
(2:07:45) the course of my 32 years i think that like the problem is is like the whole ghosting thing that shouldn't even
(2:07:51) happen that's going to kill a culture same thing with cancel culture that's going to kill a culture you know you got to if if you don't want to talk to
(2:07:57) somebody no more you need to tell them why unless it was a super violent reason you can bail sure but you got to tell
(2:08:02) them why so then they can at least utilize that reason for the next person like you know why are you going to like
(2:08:07) hoard that information from them and it's men's no it's so it's men's fault or no it's both both faults they both
(2:08:14) the cancel culture needs to stop and so does ghosting both of them that's going to kill that's killing culture how is
(2:08:20) that going to assist with the reproduction uh because then people will be more honest like "hey i didn't really like you because you know you're kind of
(2:08:25) hairy or you're kind of like you're kind of masculine or something can you know and then and then i would remember that stuff cuz mostly dudes would just ghost
(2:08:32) me and then never tell me what was wrong then all of a sudden 10 years later when i change they hit me up and then they
(2:08:37) want to be with me and i'm like what okay so what was wrong with me oh it was just uh i don't know and i'm like no you
() 
(2:08:43) tell me what was wrong with me and you should have told me then so i could have utilized that information and used it in
(2:08:49) my next relationship men's fault no no no it's men's fault in my scenario but i'm sure um i'm sure i mean for me as of
(2:08:57) in a recent like at least because i had a problem with ghosting for a very long time so i always told people this was
(2:09:03) just something in my my mechanisms that i used myself in the past seven years i
(2:09:08) always told people why i stopped talking to them absolutely 100% so you think that the reproduction crisis will be
(2:09:15) solved if people stop it would be helped it wouldn't be solved but it would be helped because then people could figure
(2:09:20) out what was actually wrong with them according to other people as opposed to people just being like i'm going to bail
(2:09:26) out whatever like you know i'll just find a new one and it's like no like tell somebody what's wrong so they can fix the problem and if they ain't going
(2:09:32) to do it with you they're going to do it with the next person okay fair enough chair one what do you what do you think we'll go around real quick what if if
(2:09:38) the social obligation is of women to reproduce and assist with reproduction which all of you agreed is their role
(2:09:45) why do you think they're failing in that obligation honestly i'm super agreeing honestly if there was give me one second
(2:09:53) okay chair two bro i wouldn't say this is something that like specifically comes down to like
(2:09:59) traditional women aren't doing their jobs i feel like it's it's a problem all over the world in countries in some
(2:10:05) countries a lot worse than the us um i think a lot of it comes down to economic stability a lot of families don't feel
(2:10:10) comfortable with being able to provide for a large amount of kids college tuition is expensive um while i do
(2:10:16) believe i mean people people want that yeah i think everybody wants that um they just want to have a and why it is
(2:10:23) the poor have have more kids than the rich and the middle class than if it's about money
(2:10:29) i think that's a question for perhaps you sure no i actually agree that it's
(2:10:35) not just it's not a failure of of women necessarily because it takes two to create a child women women themselves
(2:10:41) cannot go and create a child on their own um and like obviously as someone who works in pro-life activism financial
(2:10:47) instability is a primary reason why people are getting abortions a lot another reason is oftentimes um the
(2:10:54) baby's father doesn't want to want a child a lot of the women i've worked with seeking abortions are there because
(2:11:00) the baby's father is dragging them there because men aren't willing to be responsible fathers either so it's it's both it's men and women i think that
(2:11:06) definitely are well even if you're compensated for abortions yearly it wouldn't solve the reproduction crisis not even close sorry what' you say even
(2:11:14) if you were to compensate for the abortions yearly it still would not
(2:11:19) solve the reproduction crisis right i mean it would help but no i think the reasons people are getting abortion is the same yeah it's it's the same reasons
(2:11:26) though is financial instability and pe and i also do think there's a is a problem with people don't value
(2:11:33) motherhood and um feminism or what people consider feminism now i guess what modern day feminism has become is
(2:11:39) telling women that motherhood is less of an important role um than being a ceo or
(2:11:46) whatever and that's not true motherhood is one of the most what incentive do men have to marry women who won't submit though and on top of that here's here's
(2:11:53) here's what actually here's what actually causes it the reproduction crisis there's actually just really one
(2:11:59) major correlation which causes it is that women take their reproductive years
(2:12:05) their 20s which is their primary reproductive years and they go to college in their 20s and they don't
(2:12:11) start having families until they're about on average now in the us 28 years old before they start but a lot of them
(2:12:18) are starting in their 30s most marriages now are starting in their 30s because of this women have less children
(2:12:25) significantly less children so actually it seems to me that if you wanted to solve the problem of having your entire
(2:12:31) nation uh completely replaced by immigrants or people who aren't from your nation that the way that you could
(2:12:37) solve this is by having some sort of propaganda campaign at the national level to glorify the family and not to
() 
(2:12:44) glorify women going to college which seems to be a complete and total waste
(2:12:49) of what women's social obligation is which is having children and bringing up the next generation of society andrew i
(2:12:56) have a question so what do you think about parents like because they exist out there i'm just going to say they exist seeing them what do you think
(2:13:02) about parents that don't want their kids to have kids that they just want to be the parent forever they don't ever want to be a grandparent they don't ever want
(2:13:08) the identity of a grandparent they don't ever want to get old what do you think about those parents because there are those parents out there uh well hold on
(2:13:14) i'd actually prefer if the panel responds to okay andrew's point that he just it's no it's okay um maybe later we
(2:13:21) can get into it here was the here was the point if you stave off in their 20s if women were to stave off in their 20s
(2:13:27) and here's how we know this because we can look at reproduction rates especially since the 1800s where they've
(2:13:33) been dropping like a rock right and we can see that when women were getting
(2:13:38) married younger we were having many more children because of multiple reasons primary one is they have more
(2:13:44) childbearing years the second is the children tend to be much healthier three the mother tends to be able to recover
(2:13:50) much better so any woman will tell you who's had a child in their 20s that it was a breeze in comparison to when they
(2:13:56) had one in their 30s or especially in their 40s right which is like they can
(2:14:01) be god awful on their body at that point so it seems that what we're doing is we're taking the smartest women who
(2:14:08) should be at home raising the next generation and telling them instead that they should be going to college and
(2:14:13) sacrificing their childbearing years in order to get a job which by the way the
(2:14:19) types of jobs that they're getting there's basically only three categories none of them are getting jobs in stem so
(2:14:24) to delay in psychology in and they're getting degrees in nursing and they're
(2:14:30) getting degrees in sociology that's mainly what they're getting degrees in they're basically not doing anything
(2:14:35) stem-wise and they h half of them or more don't even work in the very fields
(2:14:40) they got a degree in so this seems backwards to me right doesn't that seem backwards to everybody would you just
(2:14:45) see that it's just they're afraid of a the older generation's afraid of aging
(2:14:52) what do you mean like they're afraid of aging they don't ever want to be a grandparent so they don't tell their kids to have kids
(2:14:58) you mean in these isolated i'm not familiar with this phenomenon i think it's very common wait you never it's a
(2:15:05) very a very common phenomenon that grand that you know older parents are telling
(2:15:10) their children not to have children i mean there i'm sure there's some anti-natalists out there who do that but wait they're called antiatalists wait
(2:15:17) yeah antiatalists are people who don't want other people to have children really oh okay okay thank you i didn't
(2:15:24) know so anyway yeah back to the point though um they say that's what it seems like so um so shouldn't we do that
(2:15:31) shouldn't we try to defer women from going to college and instead to move younger towards marriage if you wanted
(2:15:37) to actually solve this issue not necessarily i think that you can still
(2:15:43) go to college and be a mom at the same time i think that's important that um i mean that's a common thing that i will
(2:15:49) agree with you society pushes on women that you can't be a mother and and you can't have a career and be a mother you can't be a mother and be successful
(2:15:55) being a mother is success in itself um but you can still do both i do think in general though there's a push for people
(2:16:00) to go to college and my generation definitely is going to college just because they're expected to and i don't
(2:16:06) think that's just a women thing i think that's in general like people just go to college when they don't know what to do with their life um my my idea here in
(2:16:13) society is that if the social push for women right for for them to actually do
(2:16:20) the same what their duty is to society which you agree is reproduction the assistance towards reproduction right
(2:16:26) that's what you guys universally agreed is the social duty of women well not always if that's the case yeah but even
(2:16:32) the cases where they can't where women can't have children just like in the cases where men can't defend the nation
(2:16:38) or are unable to defend their families due to physical ailments we still would be pushing society towards a rule that
(2:16:44) men and women did do this so we don't take the outliers and then make policy based on the outliers that's what makes
(2:16:49) them outliers yep so the thing is is like if that is the case wouldn't you want the the kind of top down rhetoric
(2:16:57) from your leadership like even tpusa or even you know the president of the united states on down to be to women not
(2:17:06) to waste their childbearing years in school but instead take their
(2:17:11) childbearing years and move into the idea of husband and family that would solve that would actually solve the
(2:17:18) reproduction crisis that that would solve it done that solves the immigration issue of
(2:17:24) having to pump in millions of immigrants that solves the issue i mean it just solves it outright
() 
(2:17:32) doesn't that seem like a good idea right yeah i and i mean people can go to
(2:17:38) college and work and have children but they don't obviously because we have an issue with and why i mean but think
(2:17:46) about it it makes sense why they don't you're you're going to go to class for like you know eight hours a day you're
(2:17:51) doing homework you're studying you're focusing on career you're doing all of these different things of course having
(2:17:57) a child when you're a sophomore in college is going to put a significant demand on your time and stop your whole
(2:18:05) college career outright right so i i actually have some anecdotal and maybe the the viewers in the chat can weigh in
(2:18:12) on this andrew when i was when i was myself in college trying to date and
(2:18:17) stuff the amount of times i would get and hey look maybe they just weren't feeling it but the amount of times i
(2:18:24) would get like "oh hey you want to grab dinner oh i got a test i got to study
(2:18:29) i'm busy i i'm i got to i got a midterm got a final." the that came up all the time
(2:18:38) when i was dating when i was like more college age and uh a lot of those fizzled out and maybe
(2:18:46) they just weren't feeling it whatever but there's a lot of women who are like in some pretty intensive uh programs
(2:18:51) especially if it's in certain stem fields like [ __ ] biochem that's that's you got to study that's not
(2:18:59) that's not a sociology class biochem like those are difficult classes and so
(2:19:04) uh there is like maybe that component maybe men have encountered this with dating it's like and then you get a job
(2:19:10) then you're working 9 to5 you're tired all this sort of stuff and so uh yeah i
(2:19:16) have a question um andrew what would your advice be to an 18-year-old girl
(2:19:22) who is wants to do that she wants to be a mother at the age of 20 21 but um she
(2:19:29) has to provide for herself like her parents like i'm kicking you out of the house at 18 and you can either go to
() 
(2:19:34) college or you can get a job and move out and like get your own apartment and there's some women too like the bible
(2:19:40) doesn't say that every single person is going to find somebody to marry and have children and so we are put in a position
(2:19:45) where okay i'm going to have to live like i'm not going to get married and if god happens to put that person in my
(2:19:51) life and i do get married i'm happy to hop into that role of submission and be the wife and the nurturing mother that god's called me to be but what do you
(2:19:57) say to the 18-year-old who's like "what do i do?" like you remember the parable of the talents
(2:20:03) what how about help me recall yeah and the parable of the talents is um it's a
(2:20:09) it's a parable laid down which essentially is expressing that you should use your talents on behalf of god
(2:20:14) and jesus christ right that is essentially what it boils down to there's more to it but for the sake of
(2:20:20) time we'll just say that essentially is what it boils down to okay what i have noticed and and noted is that women seem
(2:20:27) to have absolutely no problem toggling uh working and then going to college
(2:20:32) part-time so that they can uh get a degree they can seem to be laser focused on career if necessary but when it comes
(2:20:39) to being laser focused on marriage they seem to kind of let that go by the wayside and i hear a lot of the god cope
(2:20:46) which says "hey right i'm just waiting for god to put the right man in front of me." well how about you use your
(2:20:52) god-given talents and find the right damn man there's tons of them out there and focus like a laser like you would on
(2:20:59) school and college and this type of thing instead of utilizing the cope of like one day i hope that god will magic
(2:21:06) down the correct man for me it's like look you have talents and as christ expressed these talents are supposed to
(2:21:13) be utilized on behalf of god one of the talents that women seem to really have and universally have is being able to
(2:21:20) find a man who can provide for them they even in modernity seem to still have that talent so well what would you say
(2:21:26) to the verse he who finds a wife finds a good thing not she who finds a husband finds a good thing like i think the man
(2:21:32) is the takes on the that role of pursuit over the woman and i i i like you know
(2:21:38) what i've noticed i you i agree with you that man men take on the pursuit role
(2:21:43) but i have noticed that when women want to be pursued by certain men they let it be known totally
(2:21:50) situations where they're going to encounter him again or they put themselves in situations where they drop
(2:21:56) subtle hits to their friends they seem to put it out there that they're wanting this man to pursue them right they don't
(2:22:03) seem to have any trouble with that social dynamic so what do you think like i'm going to all the right things i'm involved in a bible study i'm involved
(2:22:09) in my church i'm involved serving here and going to all these places where i would meet this man and then like he's
(2:22:16) up it's up to him to pursue once i like you know drop some hints here and there i'm not going to take on that role of
(2:22:21) pursuit and saying that i want you and i want you to provide it for me and i want to do those things cuz i like that takes on a very masculine role so what would
(2:22:28) you say to that is that wrong let me ask you a question right okay um are you part of the lds as well i'm not i'm
(2:22:36) christian just non-denominational non-denominational okay so you're non-denominational so you have a vast
(2:22:42) pool here of uh men to choose from at least in the regards of um of your faith
(2:22:48) so other faith the reason i asked this is there's some faith where look you can't even date outside of that faith
(2:22:54) right orthodoxy is one you're not allowed to marry somebody who's not an orthodox okay so that's that's why i
(2:23:01) asked this question uh but for you right if if women spend as much time being laser focused on getting a good husband
(2:23:08) as they do with other pursuits they would tend to get probably a pretty good husband but you can't expect that he's
(2:23:15) going to be magicked up you also have to do your part like women have always done by the way they used to always uh put
(2:23:22) themselves out there looking for courtship from different men and men will pursue how do you think that looks
(2:23:27) you're never going to have a tr trouble with men pursuing them that's not a problem that's not an issue they have
(2:23:34) what is the men they want it is a problem it is a problem for a lot of women pool is a lot smaller nowadays yeah let's find out if it's a problem
(2:23:40) for a lot of women if uh if there was men right now let's just say there was a
(2:23:45) man random man in the room who was equal age with each one of you and you guys opened up your dms how many dms do you
() 
(2:23:52) guys get compared to that man that say "hi beautiful hello gorgeous oh girl i
(2:23:58) saw you on such and such and you were amazing oh my god you're you know what's up hottie?" how many of those do you
(2:24:04) guys get go ahead raise your hand if you get those dms come on don't lie to me raise your hands if you get those dms
(2:24:10) uh-huh uh-huh and let me tell you how many of those dms i get and i'm a i'm a
(2:24:16) fairly well-known pretty famous at this point podcaster but you're married a couple a couple but okay but the guy's
(2:24:24) ding ding she's hang on she's married she's married and gets them she's
(2:24:30) married and gets them other women are married and get them what are you talking about so the thing is is like very few very few and i have many
(2:24:37) advantages huge advantages other men don't have so the thing is is like the
(2:24:43) pursuit is not an issue for women that's insane right they get pursued endlessly
(2:24:48) it's who's the right man and you know the uh the kind of pickiness factor and this and that i think that women
(2:24:55) unfortunately the older we've i mean as society's gone on we've gotten pickier men have gotten pickier i think that
(2:25:00) when you have countless people at your disposal with tinder and hinge and
(2:25:05) instagram you are less satisfied with the option that you're given however the dms that i'm getting are very rarely a
(2:25:12) high caliber man that i would be open to going and on a date with i've saved myself i'd expect him to i don't expect
(2:25:19) him to save himself but i expect him to have those same moral standings and beliefs that i do and very rarely the
(2:25:25) guys in my dms are that and so no i'm not gonna allow how old did you say you were i'm 22 yeah you're 22 right so yeah
(2:25:33) if you if you pursue rigorously pursue finding a man who has the caliber of
(2:25:39) qualities that you're after in this case good foundational christian ethics and you have reasonable standards when it
(2:25:44) comes to things like income height and look nobody's asking you to date somebody you're not attracted to that's
(2:25:49) basically an impossibility for most people nobody's saying that you should do that uh though i do think attraction
(2:25:55) can grow over time between two people uh but overall i would say that if you keep
(2:26:00) your standards within the confines of reason just remember that young men at
(2:26:05) your age they have potential right you're looking for the potential for what they can do when they're in their
(2:26:11) 30s and 40s most men your age are going to be broke as [ __ ] they're going to be broke right they're going to be [ __ ]
(2:26:17) working a job that's somewhat menial right and it's after they engage in family that they grow into that role by
(2:26:24) the way right so it's not find you know as long as he has the grounding foundational ethics um that that you're
(2:26:31) that you're after the christian ethics a lot of that stuff grows postmarriage and post family
(2:26:37) it's these standards are so so high though for a lot of women where they're like "oh he's got to make $100,000 a
(2:26:44) year." and it's like at 23 you can make $100,000 a year at 23 or 24 25 what are
(2:26:50) your that's for men in their 30s what what are your standards yeah what are you looking for in a guy um i am looking
(2:26:58) for number one a guy who fears the lord and loves the lord with his whole heart i think that a lot flows from that um
() 
(2:27:05) i'm looking for a guy who's ambitious and has goals and is a doer and he says what he's going to do i think that
(2:27:12) there's a lot of i mean i would love to follow after a man that his word means
(2:27:17) something and i see it in action and um i think that honestly a lot flows from
(2:27:23) both of those i think that a character in a guy if he really is honoring the lord and wants to honor the lord in all
(2:27:28) that he's doing i mean i would respect the heck out of him i would submit to him for sure like but there's very it's
(2:27:34) very rare that i come across men like that that i really respect are there anything looks wise like he's got to be
(2:27:40) yeah i've got to be attracted to him but i think that changes okay i think that totally changes i also think that that's
(2:27:46) so fleeting oh my gosh like i mean if i'm going to choose dating a guy who's 6 foot over maybe his character i think
(2:27:52) that that's incredibly stupid and i'm probably not ready for marriage so i mean it's like i think that i'd rather
(2:27:59) much rather choose man's character over the way he looks when i'm approaching trouble with our kids when i'm
(2:28:04) approaching trouble in our finances and the things that we're going to experience on this earth and his 6- foot
(2:28:10) brown hair blue-eyed look is really not going to hold up when we're under the weight of the world and so i'm going to
(2:28:15) marry character over that any day of the week but i also think it's tough because you do need to be attracted god wants us
(2:28:20) to be attracted to our partners like it's going to be hard to have a nice sex life when you're you know like woof i don't know if i you know it's hard to
(2:28:26) reproduce with people you don't want to have sex with totally i get it they can feel it too that makes sense right it
(2:28:31) makes sense it's hard to reproduce with people you don't want to have sex with is a fundamental part of relationship
(2:28:38) dynamics i'm not disputing that that's the case but here's the thing right if it is the case that a lot of women um if
(2:28:45) they if they want to have those resources for families when they're younger it used to be very common place
(2:28:50) for women who are in their 20s early 20s to marry men who are in their 30s men in their 30s still very attractive and h
(2:28:57) end up having a lot more resources things like this but what's happened is a modern phenomenon is women get really
(2:29:03) upset about the idea of age gaps they get super pissed about it and it's because they i'm not
(2:29:09) yeah i was always chasing the age when i was younger so i understand
(2:29:14) they get upset about it because it's competition for within their age tier right there's always a younger more beautiful woman so they get mad about
(2:29:21) that [ __ ] right but one thing you could do inside of the tier men you know if you're looking for that now and you think that women men in their 20s are
(2:29:27) just playboy is look for men in their 30s who are more grounded and established those guys probably will do
(2:29:32) a lot more take care of you much more ready to settle down and you know here's the thing this may be uh shocking but as
(2:29:40) it turns out men in their 30s really really like to have sex with young hot women isn't that crazy right and they
(2:29:47) also enjoy marrying them so it's like it's not it's not crazy for women to be seeking outside of that age bracket okay
(2:29:55) we have a a couple uh chats we need to uh get to we have you missed her she was asking a question oh sorry my one
(2:30:02) concern with the age gap and i know this is weird but simply put i don't want a man who's been promiscuous in the past
(2:30:07) and i feel like that happens a lot with the age gap and i also don't want a man that's going to die a lot sooner than me
(2:30:13) because when i'm 80 i need someone to still protect me yeah but the but but the age gap argument nobody is saying
(2:30:19) you need sons are for that's what you have sons for so the thing is is like that's and by the way again the church
(2:30:26) has looked at this problem every which way when i say the church i mean the orthodox church here's the truth the
(2:30:32) truth is is that you're making what's called deferment it is true that those men may die uh before you die right
(2:30:39) perhaps even 20 years before but you have sons your sons are going to protect you by the way the the old saying goes
(2:30:44) even bad men love their mamas that means that even if it is the case that uh that
(2:30:50) you raise hooligan sons even they you know what i mean ain't going to let nothing happen to mama that's the way
(2:30:56) that that works you can't count on having sons the second thing what's that you can't count on having sons though
(2:31:01) like that's not like that's not a guarantee yeah if you have if you're a person who plans on having five six
(2:31:07) children right if you get started young i think that you being able to count on having a son or two is pretty high it's
(2:31:13) significantly high but let's just say that you don't you still have brothers you still have cousins you still have other members of family those people
(2:31:20) will also step in for that protectorate role if your husband dies early also matrons in society have less to fear in
(2:31:26) that regard if if they they if your daughters for instance they're married now you have uh uh sons-in-law they're
(2:31:33) also going to help out mother-in-law right the idea here is that you're creating a a grounded foundation for
(2:31:41) family that's the whole point and so it's like it seems absurd to me because the other thing is you can defer
(2:31:46) resources so you can make the argument he could he'll be a father for less time by the time kids are 18 you've spent 90%
(2:31:52) of all the time you're ever going to spend with him 90% of the time so if that's the case then that means you're
(2:31:58) just deferring resources and saying "but they could also give them a way better life within the confines of those 18 years." can you address the promiscuity
(2:32:04) thing i said though because i do not want a man who is promiscuous yeah men shouldn't be promiscuous yeah that's true but here's the thing and i'm just
(2:32:11) going to be blunt with you most women care far less about former male promiscuity than men care about women's
(2:32:17) no i i agree with that i agree with that there there's a n and here's the reason for that the reason for that is based
(2:32:23) around uh knowing who your offspring is so for women the virtue of chastity and
(2:32:30) the reason so ingrained in men is because we before there was paternity tests which were a recent advent we
(2:32:36) needed to know who who was having our children right if they were sleeping with multiple men you didn't know if it
(2:32:42) was your child or not and so that's why we're hardwired against it we loathe it we think it's gross we you know the the
(2:32:48) whole nine yards however the phenomenon is the opposite often times women if a
(2:32:53) man is a virgin in their 30s will think he's weird or sick or has a problem or
(2:32:58) he's a red flag because why won't women sleep with him if he's in his 30s and is staying a virgin there's actually
(2:33:04) incentives in society for men to sleep with women um that aren't uh aren't
(2:33:10) there in reverse except for the peer pressure of women so i think it's it's actually uh i i wouldn't look this just
(2:33:16) my opinion but i wouldn't look at the virtue of the man having slept with a with um you know i don't know like five
(2:33:24) six seven uh former women even uh i think that uh that's going to ultimately
(2:33:30) be less important in that dynamic than in the opposition i know that sounds counterintuitive how you think about it
(2:33:35) though no i agree with you okay oh wait just to be clear are so uh
(2:33:41) you're you're a virgin right me yeah i'm a virgin and so are you wanting only to
(2:33:47) date a guy who's a virgin or it would be preferable and typically members in my church do wait for marriage but if it if
(2:33:54) i meet the right guy um standards change and stuff based off of the person based off of their virtues and everything just
(2:34:01) got it yeah i mean i think with the age gap thing it's not i i don't think when it comes to age gaps the argument there
(2:34:08) isn't if you're a young woman you should or have to date older men it's just more
(2:34:15) so countering like oh this is predatory on the man's part to want to date a
(2:34:21) younger adult woman okay or explaining reasons for it but did you think it was
(2:34:26) weird i had a 62-year-old swipe up on me on a dating app would you think that's weird just wondering 16 swiping on you
(2:34:33) on a dating app i mean yeah yeah and you're how old are you you're 21 i'm 21 that's normal i mean it's a big it's a
(2:34:39) big age gap i don't think that that's uh i don't think it's weird that he's
(2:34:45) attracted attracted to you i i don't think it's weird that he's attracted to
() 
(2:34:51) you but like the likelihood that you're going to be attracted to him or that that's like if you want to date him i
(2:34:57) don't have a problem with it but probably trying to give it a shot he probably
(2:35:03) tried gap it's a big it's a big age gap i mean i was just wondering where the line is to chair for there was something
(2:35:10) else that came to mind as i was kind of replaying our conversation in my head here when you said that you're a member
(2:35:15) of a non-denominational church so i went and pulled up some stats i have the advantage of doing that try not to when we were discussing because you guys
(2:35:22) don't have that same advantage but i did want to pull this up it does turn out that it looks like uh non-denominational
(2:35:28) churches are about 70% female 70% oh really so here's a suggestion take it
(2:35:34) under adisement or not find yourself an orthodox church an orthodox christian church because those actually are
(2:35:41) lopsided the other way 55% men 55% men and join one of those and then you can
(2:35:47) convert to true christianity and probably find a superbased husband just a just a suggestion you can also look at
(2:35:53) my my church if you want oh boy or just make non-denominational churches less feminine and oh there there you go yeah
(2:36:01) yeah but you really can't because um the idea and this would get into a
(2:36:06) whole thing so i'll just make it very quick but the the entire idea of christianity and modernity in western
(2:36:12) nations folds in unfortunately with egalitarianism and women try to mold the
(2:36:18) idea of equality and egalitarianism into the patriarchal religion of christianity
(2:36:23) it is a patriarchal religion has always been a patriarchal religion we worship a
(2:36:29) man right well god incarnated as a man so uh we don't worship a man that was a
(2:36:35) bad tone of words but you you understand what i mean right from the top down christ is the head of the patriarchy and
(2:36:43) your priests always going to be male non-denominational church even allow women to be priests or preachers or
(2:36:49) whatever it is that they're called within those confines it's an assault patriarchal nation yeah right but it's
(2:36:55) an assault on the patriarchal na uh nature of christianity itself it's a patriarchal religion oh yeah no that's
(2:37:02) why i agree that there are issues with certain churches that identify as non-denominational but are very
(2:37:07) unbiblical and just catering to what makes people feel good which is everything the bible says not to do so
(2:37:13) no i agree on that all right uh got a couple chats here we have fan i am
(2:37:20) abigail can you read these are you able to see it or no let me see uh yeah all right that here i'll just do it
(2:37:26) obedience obeying when you want to or like what's asked of you submission
(2:37:32) obeying when you don't want to or don't like what's asked of you wait obedience
(2:37:37) obeying when you want to or like what's asked of you submission obeying when you don't want to or don't like what's asked
(2:37:44) of you oh okay that's an interesting distinction um thank you fenim for that message
(2:37:51) really appreciate it man if you guys want to get your own message in it is reed is 100 tts is 200 and then let me
(2:37:58) actually do some venmo uh we just have thomas thanks for the 10 on cash app thomas really appreciate it thank you so
(2:38:04) much man so the read is that and then we have one sec guys tts 200 we
(2:38:10) have clitch hitchfield ask all the girls is it
(2:38:15) possible to be pro-choice and still believe abortion ends a human life
(2:38:22) no i don't get it pro-choice and believe uh is it possible to be like like
(2:38:28) essentially there are pro-choicers that will acknowledge that it's biologically a human life but they'll think because it's not a certain stage of development
(2:38:35) or it's not born yet that you can still kill them so i i kind of so i actually
(2:38:41) looked this up in cuz i'm i'm pretty spiritual i'm into spirituality and i looked this up and i was
(2:38:48) like i'm about the mother's choice some about the mother's life and you know i
(2:38:53) don't want her to have like a coat hanger abortion like for sure like that's not okay if she really needs one
(2:38:59) okay get one but i'm going to sit here and say i don't know the repercussions of that repercussions of what i don't
(2:39:06) know the repercussions uh spiritually of a woman getting an abortion but i would say like you know if she wants to if she
() 
(2:39:13) needs to if it's if it's in her cards to do i'm sorry to interrupt we have to be
(2:39:18) fair to the super chat oh i'm sorry i don't think you're directly answering it um is it possible to be pro-choice and
(2:39:26) still believe abortion ends a human life well i think this is a more conservativeleaning panel i think most
(2:39:32) of the panel here is probably pro-life perhaps with the exception of you and are you pro-choice i am pro okay uh so
(2:39:41) is it possible to be pro-choice and still believe abortion ends a human life it's possible i think it's possible it's
(2:39:47) possible but it's very yeah i mean there's like pro-choicers who are like "yeah i know it's they're like stoked on
(2:39:52) that." they're like "i know it's killing a baby i'm cool that's [ __ ] up." but i think the whole they'll make it seem
(2:40:00) like it's not a human life and that's their cope is to make abortion okay is because it's not a human so yeah it's
(2:40:07) possible but i don't think it's moral i think the abortion industry dehumanizes
(2:40:12) babies so much nowadays and stuff it's just disgusting well lydia we have a video from you that we're going to react
(2:40:18) to a little bit later on in the show uh relate i think it is related to abortion right i don't i don't know i have well
(2:40:25) you have a lot of videos so but uh i know we're going to pull that up we have some super chats coming in we have baz
(2:40:31) peek hey baz thank you so much for the australian 200 man appreciate it first time donor love the show i'm 27 my wife
(2:40:37) and i are not religious in the slightest and if i got home from work and told my wife we're moving she wouldn't even
(2:40:44) think to question why seems my wife has a better understanding of submission and trust than these so-called christians
(2:40:52) okay that's from baz does anybody you i don't know who that's anybody want to respond well i mean you should trust
(2:40:58) your husband number one so i mean if if you're questioning anything that your
(2:41:03) husband is deciding for both of you then there's probably an issue within okay
(2:41:08) all right uh let's see here we have uh rachel wilson uh rachel gets super chat
(2:41:16) privileges but just for anybody else the uh the threshold's 100 but rachel gets
(2:41:21) special privileges uh we have multiple large scale studies and lots of data from all around the world showing that the number one correlate to declining
(2:41:28) birth rates in every culture is women's access to higher education sorry but
(2:41:34) it's true i see i see andrew shaking his head there agrees with his wife
(2:41:41) uh thank you rachel for the uh super chat really appreciate it uh we have steve see i told her to pull those stats
(2:41:47) up and she obeyed and submitted like a good wife it's great obeyed and submitted and based based uh all right
(2:41:56) we have uh long live liberty thank for the membership i missed the other one who came up but thank you we have steve
(2:42:02) charles in war men protect what women replenish their civilization neglect
(2:42:07) either duty and civilization declines if women don't keep up replacement rates why should men fight and die for a
(2:42:13) declining civilization that's from our our australian friend steve charles thank you so much for the uh super chat
(2:42:19) man appreciate it and uh i i'm curious how far you can how far you take that
(2:42:25) though uh because i think people agree with that but men have have a uh the
(2:42:32) state can dictate to men okay uh we don't care about your bodily autonomy
(2:42:37) we're going to ship you off and you're going to go to war and we're going to put you in the front lines and if you
(2:42:42) try to like run away you go awall we're going to capture you and then you're going to be uh tried for treason or uh
(2:42:49) what is it what what's the specific military term for uh retreat like i knew
(2:42:54) of that's not retreat no uh what is it uh what's what's the military term for
(2:43:00) uh it's not awall it's uh
(2:43:07) i don't know whatever uh yeah you you're going to be court marshaled you're going
(2:43:13) to maybe i think in wartime i think if you uh flee the battle or whatever
(2:43:18) they're just going to kill you your your own side's going to just kill you discharge discharge it's not discharge
(2:43:24) um my neighbor did that when i was young he ran from his platoon and he i don't
() 
(2:43:30) know he got dishonorably discharged and then he went to prison yeah um but so
(2:43:37) the government can draft men to war what do you guys think about drafting women to have children
(2:43:45) what do you think about that is that fair fair proposition no because we we want children to be
(2:43:51) born into families that are willing to be responsible for a child that are willing to be good parents men don't
(2:43:57) want to go and die in some trench in the french cow country okay but there's also
(2:44:03) a child you have to consider in this situation it's not just about um what people want there's a child there's
(2:44:08) there's a child involved and we want the wellbeing of that child to be taken into consideration i also don't recall god i
(2:44:14) mean god ever comparing childbearing to war men being enlisted in war in the
(2:44:19) bible sorry what like i don't recall women bearing a child compared to men
(2:44:25) listing in the war in the bible are are you saying war less bad than giving birth or i'm just well actually it is um
(2:44:32) so the idea of women being saved through child birth is mentioned many many many
(2:44:38) times that that's one of the primary pathways to salvation for women which gives it a moral autonomy in society
(2:44:43) also i'm not really interested on this particular topic i'm not making a religious argument because uh the united
(2:44:51) states in every single country in the world compels males only to be
(2:44:57) conscripted in times of war so it's not even a biblical or theological or
(2:45:04) religious argument i i agree with you i was just i was just responding oh i'm not directing that at you andrew i'm
(2:45:09) directing it at her uh that's 1 timothy 2:15 by the way yet she will be saved through childbearing they continue in
(2:45:15) faith love and holiness yeah for example moral of duty you could have a secular
(2:45:21) government that only and this is the case for almost every single nation with
(2:45:27) the exception of less than a handful uh men are
(2:45:32) compelled by force in times of war drafted
(2:45:38) there's no corresponding like we're going to force women to do this are are okay low key this sounds like the
(2:45:45) handmmaid's tail um are are you saying we're forcefully impregnating women is
(2:45:50) that what that would like how ounce are i'm not i'm not okay i'm not doing a prescriptive claim i'm speaking
(2:45:57) descriptively i'm talking about what is not what should be i don't think women should be forced to but it is an
(2:46:03) interesting thought experiment to be like okay well if the government can force men to you know go to uh you know
(2:46:10) go somewhere european theater during world war ii europe european theater theater during world war i and die in
(2:46:17) some trench and being bombarded with shells and for months on end and suffer uh extreme ptsd this kind of ties into
(2:46:25) our previous conversation with duties so men have duties to the point where they can be forced to go to war for their
(2:46:32) country and we can talk about well women's duties are this but it's not state compelled whereas men's duties are
(2:46:40) state compelled through force nobody points a gun at a woman's head and says in in a time of war where in order here
(2:46:48) i can frame it this way well to finish my sentence women there's no com uh nothing that compels women from the
(2:46:54) state down that says "okay you need to go have kids you need to produce kids." nothing like that let's say for example
(2:47:02) not even that it would be a good idea you know like think about it from even the military side c like you guys
(2:47:10) remember growing up with the army commercials like they would even put the army commercials in kids shows right
(2:47:17) thinking that this would assist with the psychological indoctrination for later you know what i mean and they had the
(2:47:22) cool music and you know they uh they would have these cool slogans like army of one you know what i mean uh you know
(2:47:29) things like that all of that was indoctrination from the top down in order to get men to fulfill a social
(2:47:36) duty for the protection of the nation same thing you know but there's no equivalent of that uh even through
(2:47:41) propaganda for women and and that's that's kind of brian's main point here so then are you are you both saying that
(2:47:47) men should not be legally obligated to fight in wars well i think i think that the draft is
(2:47:54) necessary um and i think that there's all all sorts of compelling reasons i can give i now this is one of my most
(2:48:01) unpopular positions that i think that the the draft is necessary um and that
(2:48:06) there can be great times where you need huge amounts of conscripts to defend the nation and that there is a social obligation for men to do that the reason
(2:48:14) men resist that now is because they don't feel like women are living up to the same obligations that they are
(2:48:20) compelled to have to move towards and so they don't want the draft anymore women can't be drafted right there's all sorts
(2:48:27) of double standards for women women for instance sports reporters i was talking about this earlier today they can go
() 
(2:48:33) into men's locker rooms and they fought for the right to go into men's locker rooms to interview them men can't go
(2:48:38) into women's locker rooms and do interviews like there's all kinds of crazy double standards which are set uh
(2:48:46) between the sexes and an egalitarian society can't really have that so it's like if it is the case that you think
(2:48:52) that women deserve an honored place in society as matrons then they have to fulfill their social obligations like
(2:48:59) they expect men to do or why why is it that you would have any expectations of men why wouldn't men just resist it at
(2:49:05) every level that's brian's point here right i actually agree with you a lot on the draft is necessary and stuff what i
(2:49:12) think this is just a thought i've randomly had is that women shouldn't be allowed to go to college until they're like 28 if the if men are being drafted
(2:49:20) when women shouldn't be allowed to go to college until they're 28 unless they have kids it's just a thought i had
(2:49:25) because if they don't have a career to seek after then it's a thought it's a thought
(2:49:30) interesting thought it's a thought that's a crazy thought it's a crazy thought i speak what i say i i had to
(2:49:37) speak what i yeah that's okay i think i think one way that you could take care of this is um you you take the right to
(2:49:42) vote and you give it to married households instead one household voting oh that's nice i think that's a really good idea i like that idea one of the
(2:49:48) reasons that's a good idea is right now in the current state of voting the anti- suffragettes the ones who were against
(2:49:53) feminism initially and it was firstwave feminism that brought in the suffrage movement to say that women should be
(2:50:00) able to vote they made it one of the most compelling arguments which is this will divide household against household
(2:50:05) it'll divide husbands against wives the second women become political pawns of the machine they will be divided from
(2:50:12) their husbands that's exactly what's happened it read the the anti-suffragette arguments read like
(2:50:17) prophecies now if you read them now they read like prophecies like it's amazing
(2:50:22) how accurate each one of those arguments is oh one question are indeed divided and the anti-suffragettes wasn't it
(2:50:29) predominantly women correct that's that's correct well not only that but what's really interesting is that they
(2:50:37) had to fight so that women couldn't vote on voting because when women voted on
(2:50:43) their right to vote they voted against it and initially feminists made the bold claim that the reason is because women
(2:50:50) were too comfortable and their status in society was too good and it was they couldn't incur any debt no debt they
(2:50:56) weren't they weren't allowed to incur any debt whatsoever the husband had to incur the debt wow they weren't all of
(2:51:02) these things uh that women were so comfortable in society they didn't want to be considered political cogs to give
(2:51:07) you an idea of how powerful women were in their moral stances before they became cogs of the voting machine they
(2:51:14) passed the 18th amendment which passed before the 19th amendment which is their right to vote right they got the 18th
(2:51:22) amendment passed on just moral grounds because they were considered moral arbiters in society they were considered
(2:51:27) the more moral sex because they were not political cogs to be used and it's like
(2:51:33) and they gave up all that high ground it's just crazy to me it's like it's like backwards you know what i mean it's backwards we should not be dividing
(2:51:39) husbands against wives we don't need to do that it's not necessary
(2:51:45) i would say in hang on chair three chair chair chair three was giving me the look though she was giving me the like sorry
(2:51:50) i have rbf this crazy [ __ ] guy this crazy fucker's ideas over here
(2:51:57) do you actually think that women should not have the right to vote well actually i think most people shouldn't have the
(2:52:03) right to vote not just women specifically and here well let me make a case and let's see maybe i can make a
(2:52:09) compelling enough argument that i can change your mind does that sound fair you can try so do you think that you're
(2:52:16) pretty informed on the issue of abortion yes do you think that most women at 18
(2:52:21) years old are no but i don't think most men are either why do you think it's a good idea yeah men either exactly agreed
(2:52:28) do you think it's a good idea that they can nullify your well-informed vote that they can what nullify your well-informed
(2:52:34) vote on that issue i think that everyone should still have the right to use their vote when they are impacted by the
(2:52:41) government why do you hate the founders so much the founders didn't believe that i founding fathers not only didn't
(2:52:46) believe that but set it up so that that system was not in place they believe that stakeholders in society themselves
(2:52:52) should have the right to vote because they were informed on these political issues and had stake in society and that
(2:52:58) the youth especially like our founding fathers would roll over in their graves if they knew that 18year-olds could vote
(2:53:04) inside of political elections they would lose their [ __ ] minds they'd be like "what are you people doing are you insane?" um so i mean why do you why do
(2:53:13) you disagree with them why do you think it's a good idea because they're still impacted by the government that creates the ability for the government to
(2:53:19) oppress 18y olds i mean 10 18y olds are 10y olds are 18y olds are impacted by
(2:53:24) the government should they be able to vote well first of all 10 year olds can't also don't fight wars but no i i
(2:53:32) honestly i mean that is it's a valid argument but no 18 yeah it's a valid argument 18-year-olds can be drafted and
(2:53:38) they can't buy a beer they can't buy a [ __ ] beer they can't rent a car but they can be drafted they can't buy a
(2:53:44) cigarette they can't rent a car but they can be drafted and go off to war how is this a good system like make a
(2:53:50) compelling argument back how is it a good system i think 18-year-olds are so [ __ ] stupid they shouldn't be able to
(2:53:56) drink but but they they're so smart that they should be allowed to have a gun and that they can be compelled and
(2:54:02) conscripted into military service how is this a good system again no i i honestly
(2:54:07) i kind of see your point but i don't think the solution is to take away vote honestly if anything it would be to
(2:54:13) ensure voters are well informed before they vote but no i think it's a hard thing because there's pros and cons of i
() 
(2:54:20) don't think it's a good system i think if we look if we look and here maybe i can change your mind uh because we found
(2:54:25) some common ground here yes but your your argument doesn't doesn't say why women shouldn't have the right to vote
(2:54:31) it's kind of just saying why 18year-olds are was my argument that women shouldn't be able to vote what was my actual argument that most people should be able
(2:54:38) to right right okay so how does this relate yeah so i think that you could do one household voting i would give the
(2:54:44) right to vote to married households i think that that could be a really good idea another way that you could do is you could raise the raise the age of
(2:54:51) voting to 30 i think that that would be super helpful i think that uh there's
(2:54:56) all sorts of different things that you could do but it's going to disenfranchise a whole lot of people and
(2:55:01) i'm just totally fine with that i don't think everybody needs to be infranchised i think what's happened is the way
(2:55:07) politics are set up in the united states they're set up between blocks and it's which block can be bribed by the
(2:55:14) electoral money that lobbyists go in and say "look um we're going to fund you
(2:55:19) with x dollars uh so that we can pump and dump a bunch of cash right a big scam for a voting block." and then they
(2:55:25) use that sort of political power um not on behalf of the constituency but on
(2:55:31) behalf of the lobbyists so why is it a good idea to have everybody politically
(2:55:36) infranchised when clearly they make terrible decisions in life and they're not ready for that sort of
(2:55:41) responsibility whatsoever in running a nation having the say in running a nation why would you let them vote
(2:55:46) that's stupid right well the issue is there's smart people that are 18 and there's really really dumb people that
(2:55:52) are 80 years old and like there's going to be smart and dumb people and so you can't just general generalize a whole
(2:55:59) completely agree with you but you can generalize and here's why i can agree with you there's going to be really
(2:56:04) smart there's going to be 18-year-olds right now who are much smarter than you not me but you and the thing i'm kidding
(2:56:09) that was it was a great joke i slipped it in there it was a great joke but anyway there's going to be 18-year-olds who are out there who are smarter than
(2:56:16) me and you i agree with that there's not going to be many though and there's going to be 80 year olds who are much
(2:56:22) dumber than that 18-year-old but there's not going to be that many of them okay so if that's the case we're not going to
(2:56:28) make social policy based on outliers you would never do that everything in politics is a give and take anytime you
(2:56:35) make a political decision it's going to negatively affect some group somewhere and there's not a damn thing you can do
(2:56:40) about it so knowing that having that fornowledge why would we make social prescriptions based around the fact that
(2:56:46) some stupid ass 18year-olds uh no longer can vote but the like one or two who
(2:56:51) were really smart and informed we've taken away their vote too it's like so what yes but that's politics but if if
(2:56:57) the government isn't incentivized to care about young people if we really did make the voting age 30 then the
(2:57:03) government isn't going to care about young people anymore they are they are not going to work as hard for them
(2:57:08) that's just how it would work that's why that's silly that's silly the constituency of the government would be
(2:57:13) parents the parents are definitely going to have a whole lot to say about how
(2:57:19) young people are treated and what young people ought to be doing or not doing just like parents in the home do right
(2:57:24) now with their kids who can't vote so how would it even disenfranchise them they would have to trust in the
(2:57:30) generation of their own parents to represent them correctly which by the way they do right now they do it right
(2:57:36) now did you say i wouldn't say that they no i'd like an argument there i'd like hang
(2:57:41) on i'd like an argument back yeah from me oh no i i agree there's pros and cons
(2:57:48) to each thing but no i still think that the the government is not going to care as much about the younger people if
(2:57:53) they're not having to cater to their vote and i think that if you are if you are being taxed by the country if you
(2:58:00) are having to fight for your country you should have a say and how the government is run but no i do think there's just an
(2:58:05) issue i agree with you that there's an issue on voters not being well informed this is really i guess the the thing i i
(2:58:12) would like to take to task here is this idea that the government's going to stop caring about young people if young
(2:58:17) people can't vote in the government it's like does the government stop caring about 16-year-olds because they can't vote no do they stop caring about
(2:58:23) toddlers because toddlers can't vote no in fact parents are out there making all sorts of um of political decisions and
(2:58:31) political votes based around the protection of the young in society and the infirm in society 2-year-olds
(2:58:36) three-y olds four year olds 5-year-olds on behalf of those 2-year-olds three-y olds four year olds 5-y olds because they're the ones who can they're the
(2:58:42) ones who are infranchised why in the world suddenly if the voting age let's say was 25 do you think that the
(2:58:48) government's like "well you're 23 [ __ ] off i don't care what you think anymore the infranchised people still care right like they're the ones who tell the
(2:58:54) government what's what." well also the the thing is a 2-year-old isn't having to pay taxes they're not having to fight
(2:59:01) a war so if we were to go by your argument that you can't vote until you're 30 i don't think people under 30
(2:59:07) should have to pay taxes or fight in wars why that's silly 16-year-olds can work and they get taxed should they have
(2:59:13) to go fight wars i i i think that's an issue that you're that you're giving back to to the the government to your
(2:59:20) country and you don't have a say in how the country and 15y olds and 14y olds
(2:59:25) with part-time jobs should be able to work to vote then by that logic i again i think there's pros and cons to
(2:59:30) everything i yeah but that doesn't make any sense because your logic is if you're paying into a system you should
(2:59:36) have a right to be infranchised in the system my counterargument to you is really simple then if that's the case
(2:59:41) make it logically consistent at 13 years old i had a part-time job at a mcdonald's should i be able to vote if
(2:59:47) not why not honestly it's it's a compelling argument in itself that's why i mean no matter which way you go no
(2:59:54) matter who you cut out of voting it's going to negatively impact some people and that yeah i mean it's a complex
(3:00:00) issue so we have to kind of compare our systems and see which one works the best and it sounds like you're in more
(3:00:05) agreement with the system which i would propose than i am with the system that you would propose i'm just asking you to
(3:00:10) think about it that's all okay all right uh i got to get through a bunch of chats so we have dalomar the

(3:02:52) the discord thank you ogle appreciate it man good to see you in the chat uh we have matt here chair 3 100% feminist
(3:02:58) thanks for that super chat do you want to contest the feminist accusation i mean it depends on how you're defining
(3:03:03) feminists if you just means equal rights then sure but no i think modern feminism is um i i can i i would define it i
(3:03:12) think the same way he would it would be the movement towards egalitarianism with the deconstruction of patriarchy the
(3:03:17) reason deconstruction of patriarchy is necessary for egalitarianism you can't have equality if you say that men and
(3:03:24) women cannot be equally franchised in various things so you're going to have to deconstruct patriarchal systems feminism is antiatriarchal that's why
(3:03:31) it's anti-christian okay are you a feminist what no i'm not
(3:03:37) are you a feminist by that standard no so then why do you want egalitarianism i i think that obvious like i think that
(3:03:44) women deserve rights but no i i do agree that like men are equal right do they
(3:03:51) deserve equal rights what rights are you talking about specifically any anyone yeah yeah yeah so if they deserve any
(3:03:58) right they're going to necessarily be deconstructing patriarchal systems for that to happen there's no way around
(3:04:04) that women and men aren't equal no so i'm just saying like death women and men
(3:04:10) aren't equal so in order to reach equality we have to elevate women in one
(3:04:18) way or another to reach equality like like for example i do think in general that it is good for women to be mothers
(3:04:24) now i think it should absolutely i think women should have the right to go and work to go and do have a job if they
(3:04:31) want as well even though i might think that in general it is better for women to be mothers so if that makes sense i
(3:04:38) think they should have the legal right but well well but nobody's disputing that what i'm asking is this it is the
(3:04:44) case that you're an egalitarian and it is the case that in order the only way to have egalitarianism is to dismantle
(3:04:50) patriarchal systems because otherwise what are you equalizing what are you equalizing if it's not equalizing women
(3:04:57) to men that's the case necessarily you're going to be dismantling patriarchal system definitionally then
(3:05:04) if you believe in that you would be a feminist yeah i suppose no i i think i think there are
(3:05:10) certain things like for instance i don't think women should be drafted that is one thing so i don't necessarily that's not very equal i know that's i i i will
(3:05:17) i'll take that back maybe not exactly but so why is it the case though why shouldn't women be drafted because i
(3:05:24) well i i i honestly have issues with men in general being drafted like i i don't
(3:05:29) what do you mean i do think that there's an argument that it's taking away like their bodily autonomy well yeah but the
(3:05:37) thing is is governments and nations are not going to relinquish their right to uh force its citizen citizenry into a
(3:05:44) mil military conflict if needed so um given the reality that men do have to
(3:05:50) register with selective service uh should women equally have to register too
(3:05:56) no i don't think so at the end of the day and i mean i guess that's an example of something that i do think is is different i think when i'm talking about
(3:06:02) equal rights i'm talking about just generalized i mean we we can talk about and that creates privilege in society now now you're creating privilege for
(3:06:09) women so no i think men and women women are different privilege i think men and women i agree men and women are
(3:06:15) different you're getting a privileged role you don't have to go fight no wars and get drafted what do men get what do
(3:06:20) we get in exchange for that well women are considered the crown hang on let her answer let her answer well i think honor
(3:06:26) first of all i think that that's a huge thing that men are honored for fighting the war by who other men or women by
(3:06:34) because in this case you get you get an elevated position men get to be honored for the position of dying on your behalf
(3:06:40) well that's fantastic what a great deal for us no i think i think that i it's it's
(3:06:45) different in that aspect so again maybe not sorry i said equal i'm i'm talking equal as in as in our basic
(3:06:52) constitutional rights um but no i do think men and women are different so i'm not a so then would that be a violation
(3:06:58) of our basic constitutional rights to have a draft it can't be right because congress can definitely call up the
(3:07:04) militia when they need to right i do can i mean i go back and forth on that i
(3:07:09) just i i don't necessarily oppose the draft i just do i do have concerns about it i do you had something abigail go
() 
(3:07:16) ahead yeah i'm curious if you're against the patriarchal system or if you're for it and what aspects like what specifics
(3:07:25) i mean all aspects yeah all aspects just
(3:07:30) relationship the patriarch leading the society no no okay no
(3:07:36) definitely not no i think men are are are made by god typically to be leaders absolutely okay not that women can't be
(3:07:44) leaders in some aspects but typically not the same way i'm just curious i guess something that
(3:07:50) wait hold on just why you're moving right then they can't be leaders
(3:07:55) they just like their leadership is a little too much no you're good they don't want to defy um go ahead
(3:08:02) so it's interesting though i i think most women don't have any qualms with
(3:08:08) the current status quo of okay men uh they're the only ones that get drafted they're the ones that fight the wars
(3:08:15) they're the ones that overwhelmingly die and there's really doesn't seem to be
(3:08:21) much really any much uh of a social movement against forced military
(3:08:28) conscription of men by women uh most women are just like "yeah i don't want
(3:08:34) to go to war men should be like yeah in some sort of here let me ask you a question you said that men should not be
(3:08:39) drafted." well i i'm not necessar i i have concerns about it what are your like i again i think it i think it is i
(3:08:46) mean forcing people to fight for a country is can be a little bit against
(3:08:52) their bodily autonomy but no i do think it is sometimes necessary it's not great i don't like that we're dragging people
(3:08:58) that don't want to be there yes i agree with you it's bad yeah it's it's sometimes necessary though bad well
(3:09:04) here's the scenario war bad yeah war bad here's the scenario i would present to you is um
(3:09:12) so let's say there's an invading country let's i it doesn't even need to be a
(3:09:17) specific one it's just a hypothetical uh i don't know kazakhstan they're become a military superpower or some [ __ ] and
(3:09:24) they're going to invade the country and they are uh they are
(3:09:30) uh here's their policy if they invade the successfully invade the country
(3:09:36) they're going to kill all the fighting age males in that country who aren't even in the military and then they're
(3:09:41) going to take all the women in the country as war brides uh do you think then you should compel
(3:09:48) men and here's the scenario if you don't compel men to uh you force them to join
(3:09:55) the military to be part of the military then you know definitively that you will
(3:10:01) lose this war against kazakhstan and they're going to grape all the women and kill all the men do you think then that
(3:10:08) it would then warrant forcing men so that the women don't get raped and all
(3:10:13) the men don't die anyways to then fight and if you do fight then you have a 50% chance of winning versus just you will
(3:10:20) lose if you don't do this absolutely that's why i'm saying i have concerns about it but i do think it's sometimes something that's necessary right so
(3:10:25) that's but i mean that's the whole idea of okay well there are some circumstances in which and look there's
(3:10:31) been drafts where like vietnam war didn't need to shouldn't have been in that conflict to begin with that's a
(3:10:38) whole another conversation uh some drafts are not for like the the
(3:10:43) lifeblood protection of the nation um but there are some that are and so in
(3:10:50) this instance it's like okay well you would do that right uh so i'm just i
(3:10:56) don't know it seems but why not then compel women i think well i think men
(3:11:01) have a biological advantage and that's why we do draft men because they have um
(3:11:07) they're typically physically stronger um but no i i think that's why but no i
(3:11:12) think in general i'm i'm not necessarily opposed to draft i just do have concerns i mean i don't think anyone here thinks
(3:11:17) "oh it's great it's fantastic that we're forcing people to fight." no it's a necessary thing that isn't great but
(3:11:24) what do men get for that sole burden and duty being placed on them well it's not
(3:11:29) like women are just sitting back at home or they shouldn't be what do you mean like they're they're still doing things
(3:11:35) to support men they should be yeah but from the government down what is the government compelling by force women to
(3:11:42) do in wartime nothing yeah and i honestly like i think that it's because
(3:11:48) men have a physical advantage but no i i agree it's it's different in that way do
(3:11:54) you think that women that volunteer like you know like i volunteer as tribute um like the that instead of a man like that
(3:12:01) has a family a woman that volunteers and is like h well i have nothing going on
(3:12:06) for me so i'll just join the military do you think that she could just get like an honorable like you know like status
(3:12:12) or something uh you know once the war is over once she completes her mission uh
(3:12:19) would that be something i guess applicable for that i'm sorry what oh like um so pretty much
(3:12:26) it's a total nonsequator but okay what's your question oh um well pretty much if
(3:12:32) let's say there's a man with a family and he gets drafted and this woman's like "hey this guy's got a whole family
(3:12:37) going on i have nothing to do i'm a single woman i might as well just go anyways and i'm able-bodied woman uh if
(3:12:44) she took his place would she get an honorable or could she like get an honorable you know something for the
(3:12:50) medal of honor i i don't know something yeah i guess if she would that give an incentive for more women to do it but
(3:12:58) then again like why wouldn't the guy women can volunteer for the military yeah well yeah it's just i mean one one
(3:13:05) of the problems with egalitarianism which is that you end up taking patriarchal systems and then
(3:13:10) lowering the standards so that women can participate and that's exactly what happened in the military it's exactly
(3:13:15) what happened in the police force it's exactly what's happened across the board when it comes to any of the protectorate
(3:13:21) roles in society guess how many navy seals are women i don't know how many zero oh okay really and it's not because
(3:13:29) they can't be in fact they've been trying to get one to be for years and years and years and they can't pass the
(3:13:35) training they can't do it they can't pass basic underwater demolition training they can't they're physically
(3:13:40) unable to accomplish this the ones who were i did some research on the ones who were green berets i didn't think there
(3:13:46) was any green berets there is actually a few who are but it turns out those were just political appointments ultimately
(3:13:51) and they lowered the standards that those women could pass as well in fact the very first one the very first female
(3:13:57) green beret two months after she completed her training ended up getting arrested and going to jail because she
(3:14:03) discharged her own firearm negligently in her own house right that's how these
(3:14:09) are special forces right this is the lowering of standards and the
(3:14:14) deconstruction of patriarchal systems and military has to necessarily be a patriarchal system there's no choice you
() 
(3:14:20) rely 100% on men for defense here let me give a counter question i'll start with a gal in red she has a lot of political
(3:14:27) knowledge i'm not trying to pick on her she just happens to be able to debate a bit because she has some political knowledge so um what happens what do you
(3:14:34) think happens if men stop the role of defending women in the country what happens what happens to the country
(3:14:41) it would probably you chair three chair oh sorry ask your question again i thought you were asking yeah what do you
(3:14:46) think what do you think happens to women and children in the nation if men stop defending the country what happens yeah
(3:14:53) i mean they would be negatively impacted they i mean well they would be destroyed right they would be carried off as war
(3:14:58) brides yeah no that's why i think it's necessary unfortunately it's just unfortunate i i agree it's necessary so
(3:15:04) then brian's question which has gone unanswered time and time and time again what the [ __ ] do men get out of that
(3:15:10) what are we getting out of this and that's what brian wants to know ultimately right he's like what do i get
(3:15:15) for the fact that right this second and this is the truth this is the god's honest truth right this second if war
(3:15:21) breaks out with china tomorrow we do not have a large enough of mass armed forces to deal with it for a prolonged period
(3:15:27) of time the government can easily turn to conscription not saying they would but they easily could brian right if you
(3:15:34) need men especially it doesn't even matter if they have physical ailments they're going to draft your ass and that's going to be that he's eligible
(3:15:39) for the draft they don't give a [ __ ] about his studio they don't care about what he's got going on in life they
(3:15:45) don't care if he's got millions of dollars in the bank or not they don't give a [ __ ] about any of that they're going to drag his ass up and hand him a
(3:15:51) rifle and off work he goes so because that can happen to him it can't happen to any of you it cannot happen what does
(3:15:58) he get well what does he get he gets his own personal freedom for one and secondly
(3:16:05) women are viewed his own personal freedom taken erroneous no no wait what
(3:16:10) what go ahead wait explain the personal freedom thing no so by going to war and fighting for yourself you're fighting
(3:16:16) for your own personal freedom and the freedom of others and that's something that we should yeah but women would get
(3:16:22) that too what does the man get no nothing what i'm trying to say is the
(3:16:27) woman women are considered in christianity to be the crown and stuff
(3:16:33) you get a crown i guess you can say i mean look you got to make a secular argument on this because there's there's
(3:16:39) countries that are secular that draft for the submitted crowns are for the king not for the submitted yes that's
(3:16:45) what i the thing is is that yeah you get a crown and but unfortunately heavy is
(3:16:50) the head that wears the actual crown in this particular case it's going to be the man who's in charge of the family
(3:16:55) it's like what what do the men get socially in society for the for the fact
(3:17:01) that they have a social obligation to defend all of the women in society what are they getting for that hopefully they
(3:17:07) would get a submissive wife well they don't yes they don't even get a country where they can reproduce they have women
(3:17:13) who are infranchised with voting who vote so like here let me give you some more arguments here women are the
(3:17:19) deciding vote on almost all degeneracy in society anything that you would consider from a christian perspective to
(3:17:24) be a degenerate action be it lgbtq gay marri all of this women are always the deciding vote which are the positive for
(3:17:31) those effects every single time yes the trans phenomenon right now wouldn't even exist inside the united states absent
(3:17:39) women infranchised voting period that is actually the case you can look at a map a political distribution you can see it
(3:17:46) for yourself there's no ifands or buts about it no on top of all of that here's the here's the other major issue that
(3:17:52) you have because this is the case and men are expected to protect women in the
(3:17:57) electorate but women can send them off to war that they themselves don't have to fight via their vote that's a
(3:18:04) fundamental unfairness which exists in society fundamental unfairness that's
(3:18:09) why i agree with you on the fact that um only marriage married households should be able to vote i'm saying currently it
(3:18:16) is unfair and men do not have an advantage but they do get an advantage if they uphold christian values and um
(3:18:23) the country is predominantly christian
(3:18:28) no i would say the country is no longer predominantly christian um i would say
(3:18:33) that it the majority of people do identify that way but just selfidentification as we now know
(3:18:39) doesn't mean [ __ ] there's lots of people who selfidentify as being the opposite sex for instance right that kind of
(3:18:46) thing that doesn't mean that they are and just a simple self id of ic christian doesn't have anything to do
(3:18:51) with your actual status as one yes so the question just becomes this there's if this fundamental inequality actually
(3:18:58) does exist and it does that women can vote in politicians that then send men off to war against men's will right why
(3:19:06) is it that men should put up with infranchisement from women to begin with i don't think they should put up with it
(3:19:12) they shouldn't they shouldn't yeah they should not they shouldn't yeah i think um women need to uh seek marriage just
(3:19:19) as much as men need to seek marriage and stuff and then if you have a christian household the man will fight for the
(3:19:26) woman and the woman will nurture the man and provide relief for him
(3:19:32) wait so andrew is the is the for the question that you pose what do men get is it the vote is that the answer
(3:19:41) they get that's not the that's not the okay no men are supposed to get social duties and virtue from the opposite sex
(3:19:47) that is i see okay and they should get that yeah they get they get an equivalent social duty i agree for
(3:19:53) instance with chair 3 there are ontological differences the state of being between what men and women are
(3:19:59) itself are different we're bigger we're stronger right we don't have the same influx of hormones when it comes to
(3:20:06) rationality so we tend to make more pragmatic decisions overall not now this is not to say women are not logical they
(3:20:12) are not to say women are not rational they are not to say that women don't have agency they do all of those things
(3:20:18) are correct across the board but it is still the case they have influxes of hormones that men don't have to deal
(3:20:24) with and the one of the biggest stabilizers in a man's brains testosterone helps with rational
(3:20:30) decision-m and the skills of rationality itself men are uniquely equipped to deal
(3:20:35) with the political experience whereas women are not uniquely equipped to deal with it does that mean that women are always going to make bad choices
(3:20:41) politically no but the pattern seems to be that they have so far i'm not even saying you have to disenfranchise women
(3:20:47) though i would limit the voting pool significantly for men and women what i am saying is this specifically if men
(3:20:53) have to go sacrifice their lives on behalf of women and that's the expectation that when the titanic is going down the men are the ones who get
(3:21:00) to stay on the ship and the women and children get the lifeboats then damn it they get the big piece of chicken and
(3:21:06) what that means what that means is socially if they get the big piece of chicken that
(3:21:12) they get virtuous women women are moving towards virtue in society and towards the reproduction of society itself in
(3:21:19) the great exchange of not hating men but elevating their status in society as the
(3:21:24) protectors of all of it and i think that that's a completely reasonable exchange that from the top down we could start
(3:21:31) promoting and it would make a huge difference in society for both of us absolutely agree
(3:21:36) well said well put well put andrew well put um all right i have one question
(3:21:42) andrew what do you think are the we deserve a a champagne pop for that rant i agree i agree chicken wait speaking of
(3:21:50) for coming into whatever studio we deserve one go ahead i'll i'll get you in just a sec ogal thank you for the
(3:21:56) gifted 50und memberships actually you sent it in twice let me do the i the

(3:22:07) do it for natalia and cat i don't know why streamlabs hasn't been working for the ding but i appreciate it there's a
(3:22:14) couple chats that we'll get to ogle uh andrew did call for the uh you you don't have to do it but if anybody in the chat
(3:22:21) wants to send in a champagne pop gladly do it we'll also probably get maybe some pizza going too so uh yeah thank you so
(3:22:29) much ogo for the hundred gifted memberships you're a [ __ ] legend man ryan if you order pepperoni pizza and
(3:22:35) not every woman on that panel has to eat pineapple i'm never coming back to the whatever studio again i like pineapple i
(3:22:41) like if they better only be pineapple that you order for people from now on since i had to eat that nasty piece of
(3:22:48) pineapple pizza on this one i'm down i'll pick the
(3:22:53) pepperoni off oh no andrew that's a cuz then if it come then i got to eat the pineapple too i i could pick it off like
(3:23:01) how you did and just you know pick it off but it's it you know what andrew even if you pick the pineapple off i'm
(3:23:07) sure you'll agree with me on this it's still it's tainted it's tainted pizza
(3:23:14) it's just not it's like i mean would you eat a piece of pizza somebody dragged their balls on
() 
(3:23:20) depends on who no of course you wouldn't do that
(3:23:25) just kidding damn uh yeah yeah definitely not i definitely wouldn't do that but uh okay we have uh let's see
(3:23:32) here oh sorry you had a question go ahead oh you're good um my question is like obviously like men would be drafted
(3:23:39) if something were to come up but also like our most likely chances of war like nuclear were not necessarily invading
(3:23:45) countries like um european theater like world war ii world war i so there's the
(3:23:51) chance that they might not need all of those men actually and it's been decades since men were actually at risk or
(3:23:58) actually sent out and conscripted well american men but if you look at ukraine you look at russia you look at israel uh
(3:24:05) yeah they're definitely conscripting in ukraine actually really quick on on ukraine is compelling actually with
(3:24:13) ukraine there you can actually and i encourage ogle uh i i'll get in just a sec ogle
(3:24:19) you're a legend um you can look up there's hundreds of these videos coming
(3:24:25) out of the ukraine of men it's not just like well i'm drafted now and they send
(3:24:30) you a letter they abduct you in the street they beat you up the military police beat you up and they abduct you
(3:24:38) if you resist them uh and most men are like i don't want to go to the front in
(3:24:43) winter against russia uh no and so yeah they there's like gangs military police
(3:24:50) gangs that will drag men into a van some beat them up if they're resisting and
(3:24:57) there's hundreds of these videos of ukraine it's captured on uh security camera footage cell phone footage these
(3:25:04) ukrainian men being abducted by their own uh military and then they go to
(3:25:10) they'd get maybe six weeks of military training put them in the trenches on the
(3:25:15) you know the where the military conflicts are uh along the ukrainian border or wherever it is and uh so yeah
(3:25:23) men are being drafted and i know you say well there'd be nuclear war uh sure we
(3:25:28) do have nukes but i mean there's mutually assured destruction mad uh so i'm not really sure if i mean if it's
(3:25:35) like some i don't know how nukes are going to play out
(3:25:42) conceivable conflict global war world war iii than at any time in the past few
(3:25:48) i mean well at least since the cold war ended yeah ultimately the this is a i
(3:25:55) think the most compelling argument the other side has that you just made which is you know due to technology and the
(3:26:01) fact that it probably wouldn't be the majority of men anyway um then then how is it compelling that all men would
(3:26:07) deserve to kind of enjoy whatever the luxury socially they would get from the fact that it is the requirement that
(3:26:14) it's going to be men who do go i think that is the best argument the other side has so i thank you for making it my
(3:26:20) counterargument to this is vietnam during vietnam we had nukes we had them
(3:26:26) and so did the whole world right well not the whole world but the nuclear armed world like russia they had them there was still a draft and um you know
(3:26:34) tens and tens and hundreds of thousands of people went in the draft and many of them got shot to death by vietnamese and
(3:26:40) uh and this type of thing and in vietnam there was a draft as well the 20th century the largest killer of humanity
(3:26:47) at least to date that we know of was what's called democide death by government was the largest killer of
(3:26:54) humanity throughout the 20th including right here other than medical malpractice even right here in the
(3:27:00) united states warfare dynamically will never change and it'll always reduce to
(3:27:05) after the bombs and after the drones and after the mass destruction to men with rifles in their hands killing each other
(3:27:11) in trenches it'll always be the same it'll always be the same idea of suppress um flank kill it'll always come
(3:27:17) down to that so the thing is it's like no you could have a global conflict again on par with world war ii easily in
(3:27:24) the 21st century in which you saw half the population or more of able-bodied men drafted and sent off to war and that
(3:27:31) is the fact of the matter the us government knows it they've drafted it into their war plans they've made them
(3:27:37) all public for americans to see we know exactly what they think would happen in opening stages with many of the nations
(3:27:43) that we would go into conflict with so i would have to refute this by just saying simply that's not a historic view of the
(3:27:49) draft and two uh that we could easily get into a global conflict where a majority of men were in fact drafted
(3:27:59) i agree that we could too sorry had to do it opal_glue.net net donated

(3:29:35) wait what to her what's the question oh no no not that i'm talking about the question i'm sorry uh chris schroinger's

(3:30:32) oh nice oh nice that was quick what i call it i call it like it's a it's
(3:30:37) treats for irish drunks right because the cherry soaks in it's really quite
(3:30:42) delicious nice ole you're a [ __ ] legend sir
(3:30:47) what do you drink andrew legend okay vodka for me all right uh let's see here
(3:30:54) so what here's what happened i'll tell you why very quick story the reason i drink vodka instead of the traditional
(3:31:00) irish men's drink which is whiskey because i'm half english the official foot or the official headwear of the
(3:31:07) irish is the english boot or at least so i'm s told right so what what happens is
(3:31:12) if you mix the english tenacity for pressure with the irish tenacity of just
(3:31:18) wanting to fight for no particular reason uh you end up with one confused [ __ ] and that's who i am and
(3:31:24) that's why i end up with vodka instead of whiskey do you drink irish car bombs all the time in fact i went in one time
(3:31:30) to an irish bar and asked for an irish car bomb and the chick told me that i was being racist she said "how would you feel how would you feel if i went to
(3:31:37) your country and asked you for a 9/11?" and i said "sounds delicious what's in it?" and then they threw it on oh i've
(3:31:43) heard about that some people get kicked out for certain drinks there's other drinks too yeah um christ is lord andrew
(3:31:48) what sect of christianity was the thief on the cross the thief came to salvation simply by repentant heart through his
(3:31:55) faith christ alone saves not sex of christianity do you a quick response to
(3:32:00) this yeah i wouldn't make a salvific claim however the reason the thief on
(3:32:06) the cross was saved through the faith in jesus christ he also accepted all
() 
(3:32:11) doctrines of christ right then and there all of them that's what salvation meant
(3:32:16) and means today the idea that you can have these heretics running around
(3:32:21) giving off false doctrine all the time for the purpose of everything from self- glorification to their minations in
(3:32:29) society um is the opposite of what the thief on the cross was which was humble
(3:32:34) submission to jesus christ and the acceptance of all doctrines of him all
(3:32:40) right thank you for uh that message there uh christ is lord that that was
(3:32:45) his username thank you man appreciate it all right also also that's not good enough right it's christ is god right
(3:32:52) christ is god and let's see we have uh you know what we need to do uh stifler
(3:32:57) ask everyone to rate their own actually wait before we do that hold on uh i wanted to kind of wrap up on you know we
() 
(3:33:03) spend a lot of time on this i just had a couple things here andrew and i wanted
(3:33:10) to get your thoughts on this so andrew woman uh the wife needs to be submissive
(3:33:15) obey right but are there and look i know for example like this would be the extreme
(3:33:20) argument if the husband says well i want you to jump off a bridge of course you would agree that that would not be a
(3:33:28) situation in which a woman should be submissive or obey of course not right
(3:33:33) um but that would be irrational yeah yeah but how far like that's an extreme
(3:33:38) example but along those lines of like what would be the mo like the strongest
(3:33:45) argument in that example for example let let me ask you this um and and if it
(3:33:52) contradicted your own worldview so let's say you were i'm trying to think of the best
(3:33:59) example so you are analyzing a orthodox man orthodox
(3:34:06) woman christian and the wife wants to homeschool and let me andrew my
(3:34:12) understanding you're in favor of homeschooling you think it's superior right so the wife wants sure the wife
(3:34:20) wants to homeschool the kids but the husband and i don't think that this would necessarily be
(3:34:28) uh anywhere near approaching a husband saying jump off a bridge the husband's like no i prefer the kids to go to
(3:34:34) public school but the wife is like "well no." uh well not saying no but she's
(3:34:41) like "well hold on uh i want to homeschool the kids as the wife but the
(3:34:46) husband's saying "no we're going to send them to public school." in that situation while women ought to be
(3:34:53) submissive and obey their husbands but you would agree that the wife is right i
(3:34:59) assume um what would you say in that i would agree that she's factually correct and he would be factually incorrect but
(3:35:05) what would you say in that situation what should the i guess the so i'll answer both of these questions because
(3:35:12) they they're an answer to each other god's nature is non-contradictory and unchanging for god is the logos logic is
(3:35:20) also part of god's nature reason must comport to logic so if somebody asks you
(3:35:26) to jump off a bridge does not comport to reason and so therefore you don't jump off the bridge this would be a sign of
(3:35:32) the satanic in fact it doesn't comport the nature of god so that's answer one when it comes to the idea that uh a
(3:35:39) woman and a husband could disagree and the woman can be right this does happen of course it happens especially let's
(3:35:45) take the homeschool example i would even say she was correct right however is
(3:35:50) what he's asking comporting with reason yeah it comports to reason to say we want to send your kids to a public
(3:35:56) school things like that she does still need to submit to his will now in this case you have children you have family
(3:36:02) you have other things this is why i think the ecclesiastical authority of the church is so important and having a
(3:36:07) church body for support they can still go to the body of the church to ask for
(3:36:13) assistance in making those kind of great decisions on behalf of their family if they have that kind of dispute which is
(3:36:19) going on the church may still say you need to submit to your husband's authority and rightfully so but at least
(3:36:25) there's a body of support there that secularists don't even have they don't even have it it's like so you already
(3:36:31) have a superior uh way of living immediately that that secularists don't even have access to it's like uh in this
(3:36:38) particular case you can still go to the body of the church and ask for assistance and this is done daily by the
(3:36:44) way done daily and by the way inside of orthodoxy for instance or catholicism
(3:36:49) your priest think of your priest like an assignment to you as a spiritual father that's what they are their job day and
(3:36:55) night is to pray for you assist you help you in those big life decisions and
(3:37:01) assist you towards the things that it is that you're trying to gravitate towards in life and what's so interesting about
(3:37:07) it for instance when my father-in-law he was literally on his deathbed my i called my priest at 3:00 a.m and left
(3:37:14) him a message and he was at the hospital 40 minutes later right i was like "you might have to come down here and do the the last rights i'm sorry to call you so
(3:37:21) late." he showed up with red eyes right it's completely exhausted had to go to
(3:37:26) work himself in a couple of hours right and said "well i'm here right and whatever you guys need." that is a form
(3:37:33) of structure that you don't see often in that that secularists have access to so it's like that that sort of
(3:37:39) ecclesiastical authority is necessary and i understand i understand the conflict that you bring up but i think
(3:37:45) still ultimately absent that absent that ecclesiastical authority she does need to submit to his authority she does okay
(3:37:54) got it very well said yeah i was just curious in a situation like that where
(3:38:00) uh you would be like you would side with the woman in this case but it's not some
(3:38:06) extreme example like jump off a bridge it's just something like that even then
(3:38:12) that doesn't comport to reason right yeah that just doesn't comport to reason it has to comport to reason otherwise
(3:38:18) you're violating the very nature of christian ethics immediately got it so that's just asking like um if if anytime
(3:38:25) somebody would ask you to violate christian ethics themselves your obligation then is actually to resist
(3:38:32) got it immediately resist okay all right um we're going to get to stifler ask
(3:38:39) everyone to rate their own looks on a scale of 1 to 10 you can't pick seven starting with you go ahead damn that
(3:38:44) kind of sucks i was going to say a seven um i would say in my own head i believe
(3:38:49) i'm a 10 i feel like every woman should believe they're a 10 but i honestly i
() 
(3:38:54) just i would say i'm a 10 but okay should all and you said all women should believe they're 10 yeah just in their
(3:39:01) own thought but to society to what about men should all men believe their tens if
(3:39:07) they think so they think that they have like a good leadership they have a good moral so there's no room for self-improvement and you think that's
(3:39:13) good yeah no you're always good for self-improvement but 10 means there's no room for looks looks yeah even looks
(3:39:20) still there's always room for improvement yeah but that's up to you what what are we improving like what are
(3:39:26) you talking about like makeup or what no you could improve your health that improves your appearance men can improve
(3:39:32) their physique that improves their appearance yeah so okay um but but i'm a
(3:39:39) 10 now and i'm a 10 when i have abs both men and women should view themselves as well okay what about you uh rate your
(3:39:46) looks on a scale of 1 to 10 i just don't believe worth is defined in numbers so it's not something i do or believe in
(3:39:52) okay well let's test this uh would you date a dwarf i
(3:39:57) was i was attracted to him and he met my standards are you typically attracted to dwarves i haven't met that many
(3:40:05) so would it be would it be your preference to date a like a guy who's physically fit and 6' one or a guy who's
(3:40:11) 4 foot n my preference would be the first but i'm just saying i don't i don't think it
(3:40:17) needs to be quantified in numbers i think it has intrinsic intrinsic worth and it goes outside of just phys i just
(3:40:24) think it's vain to one through 10 well it wouldn't it be vain for you to not date somebody who's a dwarf technically
(3:40:31) if i had to face that decision then yes but i'm not in that case but i mean you're you're you are making an
(3:40:36) assessment of somebody on the numerical measurement someone's height it's literally a numerical measurement
(3:40:43) um it's kind of just trying to reconcile the whole you can't make an assessment
(3:40:50) on looks but i i'm just saying that i am 100% happy with my looks and if people
(3:40:56) want to use numerical values to gauge that on me or anybody else that's fine that's just not a standard that i i hold
(3:41:02) to i understand what you're saying about the dwarf and you know who would you pick this or that but i just think it's
(3:41:08) kind of um it's not reasonable and it's not something accurately what's
(3:41:14) unreasonable about being able to make like a determination like let me ask you this do you can you look at two people
(3:41:22) and it could be two women it can be two men whatever it is and can you make a determination as to if one is more
(3:41:29) attractive than the other yes that's just personal preference but that would be so okay but we can start rank
(3:41:34) ordering so if i give you 10 10 10 people you could start maybe ranking them in terms of okay this he's most
(3:41:41) attractive next next next but that's just not like a belief system that i choose to like apply to so technically
(3:41:48) yeah i could i could sort them all but i just don't do that well i mean it's it's not even something
(3:41:55) that is proactively done it's just automatically happening that is the
(3:42:02) nature of physical attraction maybe i mean i are you not physically gross um
(3:42:07) are you not physically attracted or do you not find men physically attractive like you you don't cuz some women are
(3:42:14) like i'm uh what what's sapioexual and i only care it's [ __ ] but i only care
(3:42:20) about their brain and stuff and their values or whatever it's like okay everybody i it's it makes it's very hard
(3:42:28) for me to believe that someone's can't make determinations on looks i could make a determination but the overall
(3:42:34) like factor and consideration of choosing one person over another is just such a bigger consideration because not
(3:42:40) only is it into physical pre visual physical preference it goes so far beyond that moral character i think if
(3:42:47) we were just going off that all the time yeah i i agree that there's things that that are more important and there's
(3:42:53) other factors to how uh what we care about when it comes to who we want to partner with uh but i think downplaying
() 
(3:43:02) the fact that uh physical appearance and attraction are fairly important here uh
(3:43:08) i mean it's unreasonable um okay so but just to be clear you don't
(3:43:16) care about physical attract like you you don't care about looks in a men i don't care about quantifying it in numbers and
(3:43:23) sorting people into boxes i just don't think it's okay why why would it not be
(3:43:28) okay because every person has innate value and i'm not disputing that whatsoever mhm but
(3:43:38) um but you i i'm it would be fair to say that you
(3:43:44) would prefer to date somebody who's physically attractive that i'm attracted to yes and that can so you're sorting
(3:43:50) them into a box though yeah yeah but it's not a numerical rate sheet of oh
(3:43:56) that person's in that category and i'm here and they're there but yeah i'm attracted to a person well i mean now
(3:44:01) you're sugar coating it's like okay well i'm not doing this i'm not assigning a number to it but like what you're
(3:44:07) actually doing when if you see like let's say you're in a room and you see 10 men and you're going to be you're
(3:44:14) going to make determinations in your brain like this one's the most physically attractive this one's the
(3:44:19) least physically attractive mhm you're doing it anyways yeah and that's that's
(3:44:24) fair i'm we all do it in our heads we sort things um but it's just not like a value system that i would choose to
(3:44:31) share on this platform like i i don't want to do that is it is it because you're a 10
(3:44:37) is that because you think you're 10 you can just you want to say you're a 10 it's okay i won't be upset
(3:44:44) you want you could all right um uh
(3:44:51) okay uh do you have any racial preferences like would you only date a white guy no i don't have any you really
(3:44:59) you you'll date like a indian guy asian guy you're you've dated two guys right what
(3:45:05) uh were they both white no the last one was middle eastern middle eastern okay so one one white guy though and one
(3:45:11) middle eastern guy mhm hispanic no racial preferences no okay no hi how
(3:45:18) tall was your last boyfriend 6 foot what about the boyfriend before that 6'3 ah
(3:45:25) interesting now that we start to uncover the truth here so the average male height's 5'10 of the two boyfriends
(3:45:31) you've had one of them is in the one percentile of men 6'3 the other is like i think the top 10 top 15% of the men uh
(3:45:39) how tall are you 56 56 right uh so it's interesting to me that you say you would
(3:45:45) date a short guy i've dated of the two men okay okay but of the two men you had
(3:45:51) long-term relationships with both of them are above average height that's kind of interesting but
(3:45:57) you don't really care i don't care about it women say this i'm not really interested in what women say i look at
(3:46:03) what they do in your case you dated two men that are one of which is well above
(3:46:08) the average male height and six foot is uh there's a higher proportion of men that fall under uh six feet but there's
(3:46:15) two men that pursued me and they happen to be over six feet what okay wait so just to be clear wait they happen to be
(3:46:21) under six feet they happen to be six feet six foot wait but are those the only two men who
(3:46:29) have ever pursued you in your entire life no okay i don't yeah okay cool they
(3:46:34) you're just saying i'm looking what at a what a woman does but the men that you ended up in relationships with happened
(3:46:42) to be six feet and six foot three okay so you don't care about height but
(3:46:50) look i mean it it doesn't necessarily disprove it but it's convenient that you
(3:46:56) say you don't care about height you don't care about looks but these are like like 99 one of the guys is like
(3:47:03) 99 to 10 to that i'm not saying i disagree with the notion entirely that would be absurd but rating it on a scale
(3:47:10) of 1 to 10 or i only date guys that are over 61 would just be dumb how about this um who do you think is the most
(3:47:16) beautiful woman in the world and you can be like uh it doesn't have
(3:47:22) to be like right now it could be megan fox when she was 20 or something
(3:47:28) i don't know how about this who's like a very beautiful woman who you think is like top tier um
(3:47:39) lily james lily who the [ __ ] i don't know who that
(3:47:45) is um do you think you're as attractive as her no physically attractive okay all
(3:47:51) right well um don't think you're going to give an answer so what about you um i
(3:47:57) uh i think that i mean first of all i think that uh in the eyes of the world it's subjective um in the eyes of god
(3:48:02) we're all tens but i think from a worldly standard i'm like an average person probably say i'm a six okay but
(3:48:10) that's what i was trying to say earlier wait hold on true true that's what i no no not that you're a six not that you're
(3:48:16) a six no no no no no but like yeah in the eyes of everybody else yeah you should think
(3:48:21) you're a 10 but what society norms is they're going to be like but it is like how she said personal preference because
(3:48:27) i could be like well i like them i like these and there is those shallow people that are like "oh i will only date these
(3:48:33) type of people or these type of categories." so it's just like a doesn't matter at the end of the day you should
(3:48:39) just care what you think you are all right well i'll get into that in a bit but um what about you um i agree with
(3:48:47) her in a lot of ways like i think quantifying it just i mean it's kind of
(3:48:52) you know but like but again everybody does have the um like they i mean their
(3:49:00) own personal preferences right like what i think is going to be different than what you think but i mean just for sake
(3:49:05) of time i would just say like i would just say like i would say an eight since
(3:49:11) i can't say a seven but i would have gone with seven okay sure of course all right what about you do you want the two
(3:49:17) second answer or the 10 seconds two seconds two seconds um eight okay okay
(3:49:23) six all right 3.7 3.7 all right abigail yes i would lean
(3:49:29) more towards six than i would eight so okay i give myself a five andrew what about you
(3:49:37) well i mean in the face of all these high numbers how could i be anything less than a 10
(3:49:42) it's true yeah wait wait why are you laughing you don't believe me
(3:49:48) in god's eyes you're a 10 so yeah see i'm a 10 so so you just so then
(3:49:54) i guess the rating system just means nothing i have a question so um there's a different question for
(3:50:02) guys i've been told you know i mean i've been in the adult entertainment industry for a long time and some people have
(3:50:09) said to me they're like lauren you're not a beautiful woman but you're a cute woman what is that like that that's what
(3:50:15) i'm kind of like that's why i rate like an eight or like a 7.5 sometimes cuz i think that there's a difference between
(3:50:20) beauty in a woman and cuteness like it's it's it seems to be that's the answer
(3:50:26) and i don't know really what these men see but that's what the answer i have gotten they see the same thing that you
(3:50:32) see they say you're say these here i'll explain when you say uh people say this ridiculous [ __ ] all the time yeah you're
(3:50:38) not beautiful but cute yeah they go beauty is subjective it's like no it's not right the same woman and the same
(3:50:44) man basically anywhere in the world who looks at a person who has a hunchback and they're missing their teeth right
(3:50:50) and they have like burn marks on their face pock marks and [ __ ] like that they pretty universally are like "uh no." why
(3:50:58) because you're talking about ideas of reproduction yeah right attraction is based around ideas of reproduction if
(3:51:04) you wonder why it is that men are attracted to youthful looking women so what is it's because they're attracted
(3:51:10) to the ideas of reproduction attraction wouldn't even exist except to assist with reproduction right that's what the
(3:51:16) whole point of it is question though so ultim hang on hang on let me finish and then you can ask the question i think that's fair
(3:51:22) so ultimately it just comes down to this there are actually objective beauty standards and youthfulness you're going
(3:51:29) to be looking for things like a um i think disney used to kind of really
(3:51:34) promote this quite a bit right the healthy looking woman somewhat hourglass shaped right hourglass shaped very
(3:51:40) symmetrical features right um and a very healthy look about robust healthy look
(3:51:46) um and these are universals these aren't just subjective features right these are
(3:51:52) things almost all of us this is why i think women and men will often look at women and be like "wow she's beautiful."
(3:51:58) both of us can make the same assessment that's a beautiful woman because we still understand what the attractive
(3:52:03) levels are between the interexes right my my yeah and i i understand that and i
(3:52:09) guess my question is is what does guys mean by when they say you're lauren you're not a beautiful woman but you're a cute woman what does that mean and i
(3:52:17) i've heard that a few times like i'm talking like over 15 times it makes you feel like a puppy so i just don't know
(3:52:22) what it means it means that you ain't jennifer love hewitt in the '9s but they'd bang you that's
(3:52:28) okay i get that that's what it means like i got that no [ __ ] no nonsense
(3:52:33) you ate 90s jennifer love hewitt but they'd bang you that's say you're cute thank you that's that's what we want
(3:52:39) you're welcome oh by the way we're getting some pizza
(3:52:45) that's coming soon i need a little need a little pizza break um so you said
(3:52:50) women should just think they're tens yeah but i think men should think that too wait can you just maybe and i think
(3:52:56) that men that i think everybody should think that though wait are you wearing a cross i thought you weren't christian what the [ __ ] is that just like an
() 
(3:53:01) accessory to no no no it's just a well my grandma gave it to me oh okay all right then sure all right um so okay men
(3:53:11) should think that too i think there's a difference though uh and here's why
(3:53:18) so as men we get rejected instantaneously if i step to a girl
(3:53:23) that's outside my league i'm not getting anything i'm not getting a conversation i'm not getting her phone number i mean
(3:53:29) look maybe she gives the phone number but it's a fake number whatever i don't get anything i don't
(3:53:34) get a date i don't get uh i don't get i don't get sex you don't get anything as
(3:53:40) a man if you step to somebody outside your league the same can't be said for women women if you step to men outside
(3:53:47) your league men will be like "oh okay cool i'll have sex with her." and they
(3:53:54) might have sex with you once twice three times they might have keep you in a friends with benefit situation they
(3:54:00) might even keep keep you around for three six nine months but in the back of their head you're never getting
(3:54:06) commitment from that guy because they they're just keeping you around for sex and maybe you have a pleasant personality and
(3:54:12) you do things for him you you know chores whatever you help him or you're doing all the things that you you know
(3:54:19) make your yourself more appealing to men but on the sole basis of your
(3:54:24) physical appearance he's already put you in a category of just on the basis of her looks alone i don't want a
(3:54:31) relationship with her now i'm not saying that this is right i'm i'm talking descriptive but it happens yeah i'm
(3:54:36) talking descriptively about what happens this is what where you hear women complaining about men not committing
(3:54:41) when you hear men uh women complaining about situationships women have access to men
(3:54:49) that are and you might not think it's the case but if you're not getting commitment from the guy it's the case
(3:54:56) most likely although look there's guys who are you could be dealing in your genuine league and they just they're
(3:55:02) playing the field right so you could be in the dude's league and he's just playing the field you're not going to get commitment even if you're on his
(3:55:08) level right but there's a lot of women y'all have sexual access to men that are outside of your league that's why an
(3:55:15) average 20-year-old girl can deal with a famous musician actor
(3:55:20) athlete but it doesn't really work the way like there's not uh there's not like
(3:55:26) 20-year-old college guys that can slide into like a famous female musician's dms and she's going to fly him out and [ __ ]
(3:55:32) him like it doesn't happen but the reverse happens all the time so you women and it doesn't even have to be a
(3:55:38) famous guy it could just be like he's really good-looking or whatever it is right you can get sexual access to him
(3:55:44) you can't and you can't get a relationship out of him right and this is why for example if
(3:55:51) i can sleep with a girl i have a very high confidence level i can get her into a relationship extremely high confidence
(3:55:57) level if i not all the look doesn't happen all the time but very confident i can get into a relationship but i'd like
(3:56:03) the women here to think about this and i know some of you aren't particularly sexually active some of you are
(3:56:09) virgins but maybe you specifically have you ever been able to sleep with a guy but you weren't able to get him into
(3:56:15) a relationship i don't sleep with just i guess any look
(3:56:21) i'm not saying not me myself but i have heard about those situations like through
(3:56:26) friends and everything yeah i do get it but then i don't want to be like the shitty friend but i tell my friends like
(3:56:33) "why are you sleeping with people that don't want to commit to you?" like once you push that and you're like "why can't
(3:56:39) you commit to me?" and they give you the blunt answer of "i'm just not ready." or "i just don't want it why are you still
(3:56:44) sleeping with him?" that's your self-worth that you're putting under and you're literally like "well he doesn't want a commitment but i guess i'll still
(3:56:51) get my coutique." like no like sure so so um i mean but the guy already got sex
(3:56:57) he got he already got what he wanted you didn't get what you want which is the commitment but you shouldn't sleep with
(3:57:03) a guy for just commitment i mean that's what women a lot of women do not all
(3:57:08) women but but let me ask you this here i i'll paint a different picture let me ask you guys this let's say a
(3:57:15) man he could sleep with beautiful women like women who were out of his league
(3:57:21) and just let's say uh every single day he could sleep with a new woman that was beautiful like really attractive but
(3:57:28) those women never wanted to be in a relationship with him they just kind of you know maybe they kept him around this
(3:57:34) average guy or maybe slightly above average they just kept him around for
(3:57:39) you know occasion what the i said "are you giving me like a good luck chuck type of
(3:57:45) situation?" like they like "have you seen the movie good luck chuck?" yeah yeah i haven't seen okay good luck
(3:57:51) chuck the i don't know what actor it is but chuck is the guy and someone put
(3:57:57) like a curse on him a long time ago and basically was like "you're never going to find commitment but women are always
(3:58:02) going to use you to sleep with you and once they sleep with you they're going to get married right after." so then in the movie all these girls were like
(3:58:09) lining up to sleep with him because they were like "i need to get married i need to get married." obviously you know yeah yeah i mean you have to have seen it his
(3:58:16) name dave i i don't know what his name but like he's like this weird dentist and like his homie that is his best
(3:58:23) friend is like a breast augmentation doctor and yeah yeah it's like a 2008
(3:58:28) ronchi movie you know and uh i mean i haven't seen the movie but sure whatever
(3:58:34) yeah um so you have this guy who all these women who are more attractive than
(3:58:39) him want to sleep with him or are down to sleep with him and he does sleep with them but he never gets commitment from
(3:58:46) them meanwhile you got a girl on his level and she wants to be in a relationship with him but he's like wait
(3:58:53) and he's he'll sleep with them once twice three times maybe he can some of these girls will be do situationship
(3:58:59) with him maybe some of these girls will you know friends with benefits couple weeks couple months
(3:59:06) whatever you think that guy who's able to sleep with a beautiful a different
(3:59:11) beautiful woman every night of the week is going to look at like an average girl who's willing to commit to him and be
(3:59:16) like "oh okay now i want to deal with her." no but that's a personal problem
(3:59:22) like if you're if you're longing for a relationship and all these beautiful women are not giving it to you maybe
(3:59:28) you're looking in the wrong place but so what i'm what i'm trying to say is that doesn't happen to men that does not
(3:59:34) happen to men where there's like average dudes who can like sleep with girls who are one two three points more attractive
(3:59:39) than them that happens to women all the time where women can like be average or
(3:59:47) below average and get a steady flow of men who are interested in them strictly for sexual access and these men are i'm
(3:59:56) look i'm not saying it's good for these men to be doing this but it is what it is that's what's happening and
(4:00:02) so that scenario i just painted that's what's happening to women
(4:00:07) y'all have access short term to these men who are outside of your league right
(4:00:14) and then what happens it's a couple things so you have one if you look at the girl's instagram you look at all the comments it's all her friends gassing
(4:00:21) her up oh my god you're so beautiful blah blah blah blah blah that's one uh two you're using
(4:00:27) makeup and you're using filters and plastic surgery and all these i know not all women do plastic surgery but all
(4:00:33) these things to artificially elevate their physical appearance and their own self-perception of how they look uh so
(4:00:40) women will be like women will assess female attractiveness of themselves or
(4:00:45) other women really generously and then they assess male attractiveness super harshly for example women will say "uh
(4:00:53) lizo is beautiful." if i called any of you girls here "oh my god you look like lizo." i
(4:00:59) don't think you would take that as a compliment but you'll say "she's beautiful." uh and then um and then the
(4:01:07) other thing is you have sexual access to men who are outside of your league and so because of all those factors combined
(4:01:14) you think y'all think you're more attractive than you're actually you actually are meaning okay i'm this
(4:01:21) attractive i deserve this caliber of guy then you're going to continuously
(4:01:27) chase these men who they're like i don't think this is a match but i'll have sex
(4:01:32) with her she wants to have sex with me and then you look at the guys who are actually on your level and you're like
(4:01:39) nope not attracted to him even though he's on your level not attracted to
(4:01:44) him and then some women do this throughout their whole 20s bouncing from
(4:01:50) dude to dude to dude to dude and then maybe they settle finally in their late
(4:01:57) 20s 30s and then she resents the dude because he's not as attractive as like
() 
(4:02:02) the 10 20 30 other guys she's been with but then like why' she settle well it's
(4:02:08) not settling but in her mind it's settling but still it's just like a moral thing like why am why is she going
(4:02:14) from d to d to d to d why is she going from d to d to d if we're not think okay if we're not thinking about like family
(4:02:20) and kids if you take like the average male in the united states who's 18 19 20
(4:02:26) 21 and you say and he's average looking and you're like okay you can [ __ ] girls
(4:02:33) who are better looking than you every single night of the week and get romantic and sexual
(4:02:39) attention from them you don't get commitment though but you get that they're going to be like and then they
(4:02:45) have that experience and then they finally okay in their late 20s and 30s they're like you know what i want to
(4:02:51) have kids and settle down and then all of a sudden they can't be uh they're not sexually aroused by their actually
(4:02:59) equivalent girlfriend they're not attracted to their looks equivalent
(4:03:04) girlfriend because they've been [ __ ] supermodels for a decade can i add something now i know this is
(4:03:11) kind of an extreme example but like that's kind of what's happening with women go ahead yeah um yeah the
(4:03:16) situation you just described does not happen um but it happens in the reverse like you were saying uh with the roles
(4:03:23) the gender reversed and i would say it's because men will see a woman who's
(4:03:29) attractive and use her for you know recreational use not saying it's not saying i agree with that but um he
(4:03:35) doesn't want that woman caring for his household so he's not going to commit to her now in the reverse women sleep with
(4:03:43) men who they because there's always the chance that she could get impregnated and it's subconscious it's biological
(4:03:50) she'll pick a man to sleep with who she's okay with him impregnating her once she's impregnated she becomes very
(4:03:56) v vulnerable and she needs a man to stick around so if she's sleeping with him it's because she wants to be with
(4:04:03) him now not every time he wants to be with her too too because she might only
(4:04:08) have her looks and body to offer and he might not want her caring for the
(4:04:13) household so it's strictly like biological is the reason that that happens to women where men will sleep
(4:04:20) with her but not commit to her but it doesn't happen in the reverse yeah true true so how does this relate
(4:04:29) to rating your looks on a scale of 1 to 10 if you have hubris and you have an
(4:04:35) ego and as a woman like cuz as a guy i could think i'm a 10 it doesn't
(4:04:41) matter i could i could think i deserve this caliber of woman as a guy because
(4:04:47) y'all will reject instantly because you're not going to for women it's the reverse right as men if we're just
(4:04:53) looking for casual sex we're going to dep prioritize looks we rep prioritize
(4:04:59) or over prioritize looks when it comes to relationship right but if we're just like trying to have sex with a girl eh
(4:05:05) whatever like looks not a big deal so they do when the so they over prioritize looks when the relationship happens not
(4:05:13) okay hold on just to be clear men care about other things besides looks but what i'm saying is when it comes to
(4:05:20) short-term casual sex men are going to like they're going to sleep with a woman who is clearly less attractive than if
(4:05:26) look if a guy can he'll sleep with a girl who's more attractive mhm or he'll sleep with he'll try to get the most
(4:05:32) attractive girl he can get but men are willing for short-term sex they will
(4:05:38) date they will have short-term sex with a girl who's less attractive whereas for
(4:05:43) women it's the complete reverse if a woman is and not all women are interested in like this but if a woman
(4:05:50) is inclined towards a casual hookup friends with benefits she goes the reverse way so she's not going to like
(4:05:57) oh i'm just going to have casual sex i'm going to like lower my look standards it actually has to be like the guy has to
(4:06:03) be really attractive for her to want to have a casual sexual encounter like if
(4:06:08) he's really attractive women start breaking their rules when it comes to m i want to wait 3 months m i want i want
(4:06:14) commitment oh okay i'm not saying all women do this but the more he has to be for a woman to be more willing to a
(4:06:20) casual sexual encounter the guy has to be more he has to be like really attractive like a girl's like "well if
(4:06:27) i'm going to have casual sex he better be damn good-looking." but if a guy's like "i want but that's also because of like society norms and everything like
(4:06:34) men could sleep with anything like obviously." and like when a woman does it it's like so i feel like just because
(4:06:39) also like women aren't supposed to be having casual sex so i feel like that's when like the woman tries to do that to
(4:06:47) make themselves better well i mean so not my opinion is the point but it's like for the short term to be like "yeah
(4:06:54) i know i had casual sex but you know he was a 10 out of 10 and blah blah blah." just because it would not make you feel
(4:07:00) bad about having casual sex because i hate to say it but like men will always be like you know psp like and they do it
(4:07:07) they they'll they'll do it with anybody so that's the point but like with a woman and you have casual sex it's the
(4:07:13) point of being like "oh man i'm kind of embarrassed." but the fact that now i'm having casual sex it's the fact that
(4:07:19) he's a [ __ ] supermodel for whatever the [ __ ] you know i agree i think it's like an energy thing
(4:07:25) i think correct me if i'm wrong the point you're trying to make is that if all women are deluding themselves into thinking that they're tense they are
(4:07:32) less likely to actually find a man who's willing to commit to them mhm yes so that's kind of i know it takes me
(4:07:39) forever to land a plane here but essentially essentially what i'm saying is is if women aren't realistic about
(4:07:46) like if you're delusional about it if you're and you're not going to like that but if as a woman you're like i'm this
(4:07:53) good-looking i'm a 10 i deserve this caliber of man because i'm a 10 and i'm
(4:07:58) a you know yeah probably not going to find a man to settle down then but then you're like "okay well if that's it's
(4:08:06) leagues right if you think you're outside of yeah but you're not going to be everybody's cup of tea." just like how she was saying it's even people in
(4:08:14) your own league but the thing is is that uh y'all and here's here's where it gets
(4:08:19) dangerous is y'all you will chase men outside of your league and you won't get commitment and then but if you're
(4:08:26) dealing with these men romantically or sexually for a short-term period of time a phenomenon starts to happen so what's
(4:08:33) going to happen is and i kind of explained it but it's like man
(4:08:39) okay have you ever uh i'm trying to think okay imagine you
(4:08:46) lived in like a l like luxurious mansion mhm you live there it's going to hurt
(4:08:54) it's going to sting a bit if you start living in a dorm room with three roommates again right like that's going
(4:09:01) to suck and you're sharing a bathroom have you ever shared a bathroom i got my own bathroom you shared have you shared
(4:09:07) a bathroom so it's like okay as a woman once you've
(4:09:13) dealt with a certain caliber of dude because you have access to it and the
(4:09:18) same doesn't apply to men once you've had access to a certain caliber of guy of attractiveness they'll [ __ ] you and
(4:09:25) then you're going to be like looking at these other guys and you're you're going to be like not attract cuz you think "oh
(4:09:32) man i'm settling." but you're not yeah yeah so that's the danger i oh you first
(4:09:37) you first go i wait who wants pizza everybody you want pizza pizza pizza is
(4:09:44) it pineapple it's pepperoni okay thank god sorry andrew uh okay so no pizza
(4:09:49) pizza good pizza three pizza pizza wait four five
(4:09:55) wait one two three four okay there we go okay okay i would like to offer this
(4:10:02) perspective for you instead of encouraging people to delude themselves into thinking that they're tense and there's no room for growth i would say
(4:10:09) my personal mindset is even though i can be objective about the way that i look
(4:10:15) it's not everything to me i still you can be happy with or indifferent to your
(4:10:21) appearance even though you're objectively not a 10 you can also recognize that there are more important
(4:10:27) things than appearance for example i do want to be attractive to my husband so i
(4:10:32) go to the gym i eat healthy so that i am but there's more than just my attraction that i have to offer to my husband yeah
(4:10:38) no definitely and then there's also more important things for example doing things for the lord is much more
(4:10:44) important than the way you look so instead of deluding yourself into thinking you're a 10 you can recognize
(4:10:49) that your looks aren't that important and you can also recognize your uh that
(4:10:55) there's room for improvement yeah i said there was okay so do you agree that that's a better mindset to have instead
() 
(4:11:02) of deluding yourself into believing i guess but also like the you should just like yourself enough that you think yeah
(4:11:08) yeah now i said that i'm not a 10 i in fact said i was a six however no i like
(4:11:14) myself yeah so you believe you are beautiful right i not the most beautifulest in the
(4:11:22) world i guess but you believe you are beautiful in the eyes of god you are a 10 right yeah yeah everybody thinks that
(4:11:30) looks are the same thing no definitely not objective all the time objectively i'm
(4:11:36) not a 10 and that is okay with me there's room for growth and i will do things to grow even with my appearance
(4:11:43) and my appearance is not the most important thing i would argue that that is a much better much healthier mindset
(4:11:49) than just deliluding yourself into believing you're a 10 i'm happy with the way i look i'm not a 10 does that make
(4:11:55) sense [Music] so have i changed your opinion no okay
(4:12:00) yeah i'm like but i respect your opinion yeah yeah fair enough is that good pizza
(4:12:06) this is actually my first meal of the day oh so yeah girl girl stop stop i
(4:12:12) tried to do one of those fast diets for the show so really okay well i think honestly too because uh i'm like used to
(4:12:19) like fasting so like i try to fast like just because me internally i have like
(4:12:24) gut problems so like i try to fast and i need to drink like certain things before i get an appetite so like it's not like
(4:12:32) i'm doing it for looks or for like appearances i'm doing it cuz i will throw up my food before i eat like if i
(4:12:39) eat at a certain time brian come back and she asked me she asked me this sorry you're the host come
(4:12:47) on give me a question i have uh i'll be right back well thank
(4:12:52) you now you said you said that it was a better healthier mindset than deluding yourself into believing you're in 10 and
(4:12:58) then you went back and said "i have not changed your that's okay if you want to change the subject wait
(4:13:06) did i miscalculate the pizza?" okay uh wait so one question for you oh she's
(4:13:12) getting up okay no the 10 the 10 the 10
(4:13:17) out of 10 beauty i'm kind of curious to hear andrew's
(4:13:23) opinion on all of this well one one question before we do that

(4:13:42) preference so samahayek yeah but i'm not her 10 huh i'm not her 10 i'm a 10 in my
(4:13:48) own head cuz to my beauty standard i'm like okay i am beautiful so that's what i'm saying i agree with her but at the

(4:15:25) jane that is jessie jane from dustill dawn i have no idea
(4:15:34) no wait but you seem to object i know you're you're looking at your friend over there no i know you girls think
(4:15:39) that that's some secret [ __ ] that guys don't know when girls make eye contact when girls do they're like "yeah we know
(4:15:44) when you're doing their shit." i was saying grown-ups she looks pretty good in girls i know y'all been looking at each other all night like oh my god that
(4:15:50) was like 2010 i can't believe we asked to come on this podcast i also have another question for you if you're a 10
(4:15:56) 10 meaning no room for improvement and makeup is meant to enhance and improve your looks if you're a 10 why are you
(4:16:02) wearing makeup because i feel like it because i feel like if you want to wear makeup then you
(4:16:09) can i mean i'm also not wearing foundation cuz your skin's going to
() 
(4:16:14) break out regardlessly it's part of life like i'm not gonna be like "oh my god i need a thousand." i mean even if i
(4:16:20) wanted to wear a thousand layers i would still think i'm a 10 then i'm a 10 no i'm not objecting to your wearing makeup
(4:16:26) but if you are a 10 10 means no room for improvement then you would have no need
(4:16:31) for makeup would it make you feel better if i said i'm a nine so then i could all cuz i never said i never said there was
(4:16:39) no room for improvement nope 10 you said you were a 10 10 means you're at the don't feel good there is no room for
(4:16:46) improvement you are at the top of the list one out of 10 there's no going above 10 so you're at you're always rate
(4:16:53) me i would give you a good seven points but you should think he's a 10 but in your head yeah but in your head if you
(4:17:01) think you're a 10 i'd be like "power to you good job thank you." like but also
(4:17:06) that's what i'm saying it doesn't bother me what other people think they are like if like how li how you said lizo if lizo
(4:17:13) thinks that she's a 10 i'm not gonna go up to her and be like "oh my god you're not thinking about this i'm not a
(4:17:19) seven." i wouldn't care like i would i mean you're still settling for me but like you're still settling for me but
(4:17:25) can i ask something so just random question so you wear what
(4:17:31) you want to wear because you want to wear it right and stuff so would you wear that outfit at home instead of um
(4:17:36) just you're wearing this girl you should see what i go to the grocery store okay yeah curious i personally i personally
(4:17:43) believe you should wear whatever you want and you should feel comfortable in whatever you want and i was gonna i could have came in like sweats but it's
(4:17:49) the fact that they were like "hey wear wear." no in the message in the message it was like wear this if you would wear
(4:17:55) it on your and i would this is a going out yeah like a wear something you'd wear to first there's a difference between a going out outfit and a staying
(4:18:01) in outfit is what you're saying well i mean not really because i would go out in sweats too andrew what's your
(4:18:07) question yeah help me out here um i'm i'm just just really curious so uh if
(4:18:13) you're not a 10 you're a nine got it right so are most of the guys that
(4:18:18) you're going out with then you're dating down no i think that they think that they're tens too
(4:18:25) so then okay so it's just based on them thinking it yeah i would but that's what
(4:18:30) i'm saying i would assume that they would think that they're let me ask you a different question let us pretend
(4:18:36) hypothetically that you were at a rating seminar where there was going to be a
(4:18:42) hundred men but i wouldn't and all hundred men hang on all hundred men were
(4:18:48) going to rate you from their own subjective experience okay and then we were just going to average what all of
(4:18:54) them said to come up with an average what do you think the average for you would be based on how all hundred men
() 
(4:19:02) voted okay so that could have been the question that stifler asked well that it was the question he just no he said ask
(4:19:09) what you think you what you are not what other people would think you are hang on hang on hang on hang on without commentary can you answer that question
(4:19:16) please no i can't honestly you can't answer it because i wouldn't know that their personal preference if i went into
(4:19:22) that subjectively it could be people that like asian women it could be people that like white women it could be people
(4:19:28) that like women that are 6 feet it could be so that's what i'm saying it's a personal preference okay we'll make it
(4:19:33) easy we'll make it easy it's a 100red white mechanics between the ages of 20 and 40 well i don't know their
(4:19:39) preference that's what i'm saying i let me ask you this if you had to put money on the fact that they would either rate
(4:19:46) you all rate you a 10 or they wouldn't hang on i wasn't done i wasn't done hang on let us finish the exchange she's
(4:19:52) actually right though i was actually going to bring this up let's say that you had to put a million dollars on you
(4:19:59) would win a million dollars if you guessed right you would win $1 million if you guessed
(4:20:06) right right it's like a game show what would what would you guess so i would say like
(4:20:12) a seven but i couldn't say seven cuz tiffler didn't say seven he said i couldn't say seven so so if they can't
(4:20:18) say seven hang on so that's part of the game show then i put myself at an eight seven none of the men can say seven you
(4:20:24) think would okay but do all 100 men have the same preference
(4:20:30) they have roughly the same preferences yeah doesn't matter about roughly because at the end of the day have the same
(4:20:36) preferences no like we'll quibble we'll quibble over which women which woman is more uh
(4:20:42) beautiful than another woman but we don't usually quibble over which women are [ __ ] ugly yeah cuz that's rude
(4:20:49) but it's true we just but it's rude but it's still your own personal thought that you should not share you and your
(4:20:54) friends you and your friends also may quibble about which women are more pretty than other women but i doubt you
(4:21:01) and your friends quibble very much about whi which women are [ __ ] ugly i doubt you quibble very much about it do don't
(4:21:08) isn't that the truth isn't it true that you don't really quibble about which ones are ugly only which ones are more
(4:21:14) beautiful than other beautiful women isn't that the case you'd be surprised yeah there's oh yeah let her tell the
(4:21:19) truth yeah no cuz there's i'm not even going to lie my friend is kind of mean sisterhood always hasn't no no no my
(4:21:25) friend's kind of mean because like we'll go out of the bar and something and she'll be like "oh that [ __ ] is so [ __ ] ugly." and i'll be like "damn
(4:21:31) you shouldn't have said that." like but that's what i'm saying i don't have the same mindset that she has i don't have the same you shouldn't have said that
(4:21:37) yeah maybe you that's exactly like i'm saying it's a thought you keep to yourself maybe it was mean hang on hang on maybe it was mean but was she wrong
(4:21:44) though uh most of the time yeah because i'll look at them and i'm like "what the [ __ ] are you talking about?" like you're
(4:21:50) just drunk yeah yeah but that's what i'm saying full of [ __ ] eating that [ __ ] eating grin right now i swear to god oh
(4:21:57) my god i swear i i will never be like "oh my gosh he's so [ __ ] ugly blah." for no reason because it's not my
(4:22:04) preference it is not my preference hang on hang on listen i'm not talking about no reason i'm saying that when you and
(4:22:10) your friends assess the valuiness of attractiveness you do you don't you
(4:22:15) probably argue quite a bit about which women have better hair and which one's prettier than another one and this type
(4:22:21) of thing that's fair enough right but do you really quibble that much on an objectively ugly woman or don't you all
(4:22:27) just go "oh [ __ ] i yeah she's uh she's not the most attractive." not the most attractive yeah but that's
(4:22:34) to you yeah exactly exactly that's why but that's what i'm saying like i really don't care enough exactly yeah but
(4:22:41) that's what i'm saying i don't care enough about another person that i really have no relation to like never
(4:22:48) met them in my do you think i'm going to care like that girl that my friend called ugly i would literally tell her
(4:22:55) don't give a [ __ ] about what she says because you don't know her like i'm not going to show right like i'm not going
(4:23:00) to be like "oh my god." like because at the end of the day i don't care about the people that are not close to me i
(4:23:06) don't care about the people's opinions that are aren't my parents that aren't my so bullying wouldn't affect you it
(4:23:12) would have um okay just i just want to point this out that you don't care about your own contradiction here's your
(4:23:18) contradiction right if you're 10 you're 10 cuz you feel like a 10 do you and your friends even quibble about who's
(4:23:24) ugly no it's like so you're yeah because i think you i think everybody should
(4:23:29) think you're a 10 i just believe that you should like yourself here just to move things on just to move things on uh
(4:23:36) and i want hopefully some quick answers on this do you think you'll be better looking better looking in 10 years time
() 
(4:23:43) depends what i do depends if i take care of my health you're 25 depends if i take care of my health because i mean health
(4:23:49) is a big thing like how she was saying health is a big thing like if i just right now all things being equal let's
(4:23:55) just do i i usually i've stopped doing the standard all things being equal do you think you'll be better looking in 10
(4:24:00) years time if i take the time and effort to do so then yeah yeah cuz okay 20
(4:24:07) years time uh 45 yeah same thing 30 years time 55 55 i i
(4:24:14) mean obviously i'll start showing age but that's normal like and i i believe that just because you're older you
(4:24:20) shouldn't think you're ugly and that's the problem with society you can't be mad not even making that argument i
(4:24:25) think people can be attractive at like there was a whole movie the substance about that you can be attractive at 30
(4:24:31) 40 50 whatever uh the question is though compared to 25 will you be more
(4:24:36) attractive at 55 i guess to myself i mean i have to love
(4:24:41) myself but it's nobody's personal preference is damn that 55year-old cougar i mean to i mean to young men
(4:24:47) that love cougars i guess i guess okay how about this i'll make it super simple you're in a club and the average age of
(4:24:54) the men in the club is 35 right so 10 years older than you uh you're in the club at 25 your 55 year old version is
(4:25:02) also in the club there's 100 men in there do they prefer the 25-year-old you or the 55-year-old you they're going to
(4:25:07) prefer the 25-year-old me because men like women that are younger cool most of the time uh but to you though i'm just
(4:25:14) going to move it on uh you're 22 better looking in 10 years time at 32 right now okay you're 22 better looking in 10
(4:25:20) years time at uh 32 uh uh into the mic if you can uh sorry
(4:25:26) 20 years time at 42 no okay uh you're 22 better looking in 10 years time at 32 no
(4:25:32) okay you're 32 better looking in 10 years time at 42 i don't think so but i'm going to gun for it i'm going to
(4:25:38) chop my hair off really short and and have it black and then have a i already have a look planned for 10 to 20 years
(4:25:44) out from now and i want short hair with black and i just
(4:25:49) hey all right uh and then going back 10 it's fine going back 10 years were you
(4:25:54) better looking at 22 or now at 32 i'm now better looking now than you were at 22 okay uh you're 21 better looking in
(4:26:01) 10 years time at 31 uh no i think these next five years are going to be my peak okay uh you're 21 better looking in 10
(4:26:07) years time at 31 um i don't think i'll look better in 10 years but i think i'll hopefully look better in five okay uh
(4:26:14) you're 21 better looking in 10 years time at 31 no of course not okay all right i mean pretty reasonable there uh
(4:26:19) you know what here's what we're going to do we're going to do the we have the ai age advancement so we're going to go
(4:26:25) through that we have put all of you through ai we're going to see how you guys look older uh because reasons so uh

(4:32:02) gota love that this happened literally just go back i you know what andrew i need to have uh
(4:32:08) what's that narcan i need to have narcan in the studio in case there's like residue that's smart they sell through
(4:32:15) your studio with any sort of like blue light or any sort of anything it's got
(4:32:20) like that studio of [ __ ] i you know what andrew here's some whatever lore that
(4:32:26) i've never shared so there's if i collected these items the amount of like
(4:32:33) fake nails that have popped off like under the table some girls were
(4:32:38) like peel that [ __ ] under the table oh for sure andrew wall out there's hair
(4:32:43) the amount of [ __ ] hair left in the studio oh my god ridiculous i'm sorry i shed a wall hair balls there's hair
(4:32:50) balls in the studio from women uh and then there's fake nails and fake lashes
(4:32:56) these are the these are the trophies that the the women leave me trophies they're trophies yeah i should make a
(4:33:02) wall of this i actually well makes sense the greatest challenge of the bearded
(4:33:08) husband is how they can keep their wife's hair out of their beard like that's the greatest challenge period i
(4:33:16) haven't heard that how in the world can i ever have a meal again where i where i'm there's not like blonde strands
(4:33:22) which come out of my beard yeah it's true it's true my dad lives states away
(4:33:28) it's cuz women women are are you know they're short right like my wife's much shorter than me so always like when i
(4:33:36) see her in the kitchen stuff like that i'll usually uh you know i'll give her a kiss on the neck or kiss on the back of the head or a kiss on the forehead or
(4:33:42) something like that just even in passing right i i just like to do that kind of [ __ ] so cute and it's just it's just
(4:33:48) impossible it's like it's like velcro right just grabs it and just pull and you don't even know it you don't even
(4:33:53) know it i'll be sitting there i'll be like playing a video game with my kids she got a strand of blonde hair just
(4:33:59) like hanging off and i'm like "well leave it." you know so after every after every kiss do you have to go to the
(4:34:04) bathroom and like check the mirror and be like "i have to make sure i don't." no i don't give a [ __ ] i just think it's you know i but imagine how hard it is
(4:34:10) for the women because like i can't wear black anymore oh wait why andrew i have a question andrew i i just
(4:34:16) got a dm from somebody saying i'm spreader like at two hours ago or 1 hour ago saying i'm spreading spread oh my
(4:34:23) god i can't speak it's the champagne i'm i'm a lightweight uh i'm spreading
(4:34:29) literal russian propaganda what what did did we say anything tonight that would about their ukraine because ukraine yeah
(4:34:37) oh you said that the that the ukrainians are drafting sometimes by force in ukraine now they're saying yeah but but
(4:34:43) who cares it's don't you understand that everything a leftist disagrees with is russian propaganda brian doesn't matter
(4:34:49) what it is like like brian brian are you protrump am i
(4:34:56) protrump yeah are you look i got criticisms of the guy but yes
(4:35:03) well i mean because you're a [ __ ] russian sympathizer putin
(4:35:09) yes of course because you don't care about the disinfo campaign that happened during his uh first election cycle
(4:35:15) because you don't care that the only reason we didn't have a first woman president to break the glass ceiling
(4:35:20) literally rented out a building with a glass ceiling not kidding for her acceptance speech is because of putin
(4:35:27) brian that's why russian disinformation disinformation campaign it's ridiculous
(4:35:32) it's true but what's weird is uh i mean there there are videos capturing this
(4:35:38) that are disseminated by ukrainian citizens a girlfriend will be walking with her boyfriend he gets abducted by
(4:35:46) the military police there's hundreds of these videos of these ukrainian men
(4:35:51) being taken for by the military police or whoever it is so i i mean that's just
(4:35:57) factually true i don't think that would whatever you say comrade okay i need i

(4:41:59) someone that's very fit and that person does not look fit wait wait hold on can you repeat that one more time i'm not
(4:42:05) very fit i'm working on it but i would want someone who is fit preference it's a it's one thing i'm
(4:42:12) working on and i i i know it's a bad thing i'm working on it i'm working on it genuinely
(4:42:19) it's okay i'm working on it i'm not happy i had severe bow depression and i
(4:42:24) basically didn't leave my house for 4 months at one point and i got fat and lazy and i'm like "oh screw it i'm
(4:42:31) getting back to working with horses and animals and going to start working out." so you want an active lifestyle so you want someone else with an active like my
(4:42:37) personal trainer but get up you loser a probably not that but probably don't
(4:42:43) both go to the gym together it's unrealistic just like the bare question it's unrealistic my answer but i also i
(4:42:50) when you say fit are you talking like chris bumstead or what's his name bum i don't know i don't know who that is
(4:42:55) sebum he's like bodybuilder super ripped oh no no i'm just wanting someone that can pick me up okay
(4:43:03) before or after the weight loss i'm working on the weight loss um before i would prefer
(4:43:10) he'd be able to pick me up before so he can actually pick me up when i'm pregnant so you don't oh okay okay could
(4:43:15) you do it with your bad back i do have a bad
() 
(4:43:22) i'd pro if she asked me to i'm good she passed out right now you need to carry
(4:43:27) her i would probably need to ice my back if i did that
(4:43:34) so mean ryan so mean but i get the pregnant thing i get wanting to be picked up when you're pregnant i get
(4:43:40) that idea bales of hay or even like sex against the wall you can toss bales of hay i'm
(4:43:45) living on a farm i'm going to live on a,000 acres okay i live on 400 acres right now and i want horses okay oh so
(4:43:51) he's going to have to lead the horses too cuz it'd be strong and you know the horses they get he has to handle a,000 lb animal i could handle a,000 lb animal
(4:43:58) so he needs to a he needs to handle a what thousand lb animal oh you're
(4:44:03) talking about like the horses oh he thought "oh oh i was on this great
(4:44:11) show." the horses brian you should have more
(4:44:16) self-esteem just well i'm working on it i know i can improve because what if he
(4:44:21) what if he just thinks like you know most normal people that horses are [ __ ] and he just oh they they are
(4:44:27) the worst jerks and i have a massive scar on my arm hence the long sleeves from when a horse bit me wait it bit you
(4:44:32) oh it rips chunks of muscle out i almost i couldn't even get stitches because it was so big yeah oh what yeah they're
(4:44:39) bastards and and you can be dealing with one who's been docel for years and get kicked oh no they're just they're total
(4:44:46) dicks you have to you have to treat them like a loaded gun basically oh no they are awesome though but you have to treat
(4:44:51) dogs the same way somewhatish i got bucked off a horse and it it got chased by pit bulls for instance i'll give you
(4:44:58) an example beagles are used in medical experimentation because you can do horrible things to them and then they'll
(4:45:05) come over and lick your hand after a just the nature of the dog no i agree i was speaking specifically about pit pit
(4:45:11) bulls where you have to be wary about certain things and i don't want to get in the pit bull thing i'm i'm probably going to ruin my pet store oh i'm with
(4:45:19) you i don't like pit bulls no they're just they're the rate the numbers just speak and stuff and it was just stupid
(4:45:25) to continue breeding them and stuff i don't think they're terrible dogs before before the whole pandemic thing
(4:45:34) i used to say that pitbull apologists were the antiaxers of the dog community
(4:45:40) but now that being antiax is kind of all the rage i can't really make that
(4:45:45) analogy anymore wait wait brian i never asked you this did you did you did you
(4:45:51) take the jabby stabby pro no no you didn't do it no okay yeah
(4:45:59) smart face brian face brian yep um so who on the panel took the jabby stab you
(4:46:05) show of hands oh am i the only one oh i'm allergic unfortunately i was allergic i did have allergic reaction to
(4:46:11) it and they had to record it at the cvs and then they had to get the eb pen and put in my leg yeah you shouldn't have
(4:46:18) taken it then huh which one trust the science i guess i guess not sometimes i
(4:46:24) wonder trust the science okay um so we're we were talking about horses or
(4:46:31) animals or horses pit wait no wait i really quick i just want to explore this so you want a fit guy
(4:46:39) i'm working on being fit myself i actually got a lot of gym equipment i've lost about 10 pounds in the past year
(4:46:44) which i know isn't a lot i am on medications that make me overweight
(4:46:49) so i am working on it i'm bipolar so i need these medications oh lord but then
(4:46:56) it doesn't matter how fit you are right like the bipolar thing is like the worst red flag
(4:47:03) ever it's like the one thing i would recommend even if let's say that this
(4:47:09) chick if you had to take a choice if it was like andrew gun to the head right
(4:47:15) two beautiful women one who has literally had sex with 500 men or one
(4:47:21) that has only had sex with 20 men but is bipolar i would still take the one at
(4:47:26) 500 bipolar it's not bad wait what about a ver wait worst on earth
(4:47:32) it's not bad bip virgin but bipolar that's great nope and she'll be loyal to you but she's [ __ ] bipolar she won't
(4:47:39) want she'll cling she'll cling i'm also watching this one 100 body count no bipolar
(4:47:46) just anything that's not by bipolar women like the stories most of the stories that i've heard from men right
(4:47:53) talked to thousands of men all over the world just like i do women right and listen to their various kind of horror
(4:47:58) stories about the opposite sex and this type of thing almost every single time a
(4:48:04) woman has gone like [ __ ] apeshit to try to annihilate a guy's entire life she has been diagnosed with bpd okay i
() 
(4:48:11) wasn't diagnosed until borderline personality or or what is it's not borderline person or is it it bipolar
(4:48:19) bpd bpd is different than bipolar but both bad so i have a question well they
(4:48:25) can be they can be misdiagnosed even though um they're pointing to the same
(4:48:30) type of phenomenon you know what i mean they're pointing to the same type of thing
(4:48:36) yeah well i was autistic and they just put me on bipolar and they worked w autism well i i feel you andrew cuz
(4:48:42) right now i'm actually what's really interesting is so when i was younger like about 21 i think like i was just
(4:48:48) going through a really weird time people were really mean to me i didn't look like i did now i was going through like
(4:48:54) a lot of health issues i had acne all over my body all over my face i know you're not a natural beauty you had the
(4:48:59) right clothes the right look you could be very striking well so okay i had acne so bad when i
(4:49:05) talked to people it would break open as i talked to them it was that bad people would insult me from across the street i think that i was just put in a weird
(4:49:11) situation so i was diagnosed with bipolar and bpd but i'm not kidding i
(4:49:17) left i know i know but hey hold on i left where i was and those people my
(4:49:23) life got better now i'm i left the medical um place that invalidated me for
(4:49:31) my ms cuz i was diagnosed at another hospital with ms and then this other one refused to and they said "you need to have another attack at our hospital." so
(4:49:37) i said "you know what i'm just going to get a full mental health eval re-evaluation because honestly i think it was the people i was surrounded with
(4:49:44) i think it was the situ the looking at myself with acne everywhere looking at myself not feeling great i think that
(4:49:51) had something to do with it so i i have not had any episodes or nothing and at all yes so i genuinely think it was just
(4:49:58) my life sucked at that point and now it's better so i think re-evaluations after so
(4:50:04) long i mean well look i'm not i'm not going to absolutely argue the point i
(4:50:10) think they misdiagnosed me i think that 90% of psychology is [ __ ] [ __ ] i agree the thing is hang on the thing is
(4:50:16) like the misdiagnosis of of these types of things is over the top right well yeah they kept giving me
(4:50:23) pills what i'm saying is is that we're pointing to behavioral phenomenon right and then trying to give descriptors to
(4:50:28) it bpd bipolar this and that what i'm pointing to is the behavioral phenomenon
(4:50:34) of women who are like on a dime and just they you know they just switch mode of
(4:50:40) them just switches and it's like those women are the [ __ ] worst ever because
(4:50:46) they don't act with any empathy in what they'll do this is the craziest part they'll annihilate a guy's entire life
(4:50:52) on a tuesday and then go to over to him on a wednesday like nothing ever happened and that everything should be
(4:50:58) good and like "hey babe how you doing this and that?" and they're like "what the [ __ ] you just burned my whole house
(4:51:03) down and ruined my car why are you here?" and they're like "oh honey don't worry about," you know what i mean
(4:51:08) [ __ ] nutcases nutcase okay i call me a nutcase who here is diagnosed with a
(4:51:15) mental illness me raise those hands high be proud of your ill your be proud i am
(4:51:24) be proud but i am going in for an re reevaluation what do you got what you got anxiety and depression sweet me
(4:51:30) lydia what you got i don't have anything i didn't raise my hand you got a little anxiety no ocd no
(4:51:39) psychopathy psychopathy she said psychopathy
(4:51:44) npd no bpd no bipolar no none of the above antisocial personality disorder
(4:51:50) nope anything nothing bipolar nothing
(4:51:56) okay i have everything well hang on i have one too i have been diagnosed by thousands of women who are not
(4:52:02) psychologists as having narcissist yeah a lot of yes i've been called a
(4:52:07) narcissist i've been called a narcissist uh okay so so you wouldn't date someone who's
(4:52:13) mentally ill wait so i have a question i have a question for you andrew so or not or you don't have a question for him oh
(4:52:20) i have a question for both of y'all well i want to hear that both of y'all here's my question my question is this do you
(4:52:27) believe that like someone's life could just be like just tumultuous at some point and they are misdiagnosed by
(4:52:34) doctors and then all of a sudden like yeah there's a there's actually a famous um i can't think of his name off the top
(4:52:39) of my head i'm sure chad will correct me and give me a massive l for this i can't because i can't think of his name but he calls it problems in living yeah
(4:52:45) problems in living he thinks most social forms of anxiety and mental health
(4:52:51) issues and things like this he he thinks that the descriptors are very poor for it and that's why we come up with like
(4:52:57) [ __ ] like bpd and blah blah blah which are misdiagnosed constantly nobody ever cures them of anything they put them on
(4:53:03) pills he says problems in living and that with just subtle changes to coping
(4:53:09) with life itself and getting rid of some people s seem to just kind of stop happening to people wasn't that amazing
(4:53:16) yeah some people just really drag your life down and once you dispose of them like they're literally like your life
(4:53:21) gets better and you're like "wow i'm not mentally ill i just was surrounded by weirdos." like cool yes yeah yes i
(4:53:30) genuinely feel like that though which i feel like if i was surrounded by a bunch of women who acted like you did i would
(4:53:35) probably develop a mental that seems fair uh here do we have any
() 
(4:53:41) more for the gender swap do we have anything else for the gender swap next oh okay abigail oh i didn't see oh uh oh
(4:53:51) man my husband has raised the bar for my standards cuz he's so attractive so i
(4:53:56) don't think so i don't look like sure him next
(4:54:02) oh it's her he looks wait that looks like a singer oh i thought you were
(4:54:07) about to say down syndrome oh like one direction or something zen malik thomas
(4:54:14) saz is his name you would probably like his literature all right next oh okay oh
(4:54:21) wow wow great screen grab there on like a [ __ ] short bus okay so a tan
(4:54:27) version and a and a lighter version i look special there when she wakes up and
(4:54:32) a hot version okay all right okay andrew looks like a basketball player wait the
(4:54:38) woman basketball player what which one the woman i i thought you said you looked like a tall black man oh no a
(4:54:45) woman a female basketball player like it looks like you'd be on the team or something if you yeah you hear that
(4:54:51) andrew you're on the team the [ __ ] you're the andrew you remind her of a
(4:54:56) female what what level is going on here tonight what what do you mean look like a female basketball player is that how
(4:55:04) they look i don't know i'm waiting on your mcdonald's watches female basketball so we don't know right but if
(4:55:09) they did is that what they look like well like angela reese yes yeah angel reese andrew you are just a you just
(4:55:17) have a striking resemblance to those female basketball players
(4:55:24) yeah put him in actually andrew i think you would actually do really well in the wnba
(4:55:29) like you would you men and women's sports got to love it um
(4:55:36) natalia she says "bet they'd swipe left on themselves that they were gender swapped on a dating app." well put
(4:55:41) natalyia yeah i mean that that's kind of the point of this it's not perfect but uh i think if we lined up a lot of women
(4:55:49) put them next to their male equivalent uh this doesn't have to be like gender swap it could just be your male
(4:55:54) equivalent i think n like a lot of women would be kind of mortified be like "really that's my that's where i'm at?"

(5:02:59) then hold on i got to play my other noises oh [ __ ] how these rooms okay go ahead go ahead
(5:03:06) yeah you're you're not with him anymore are you yeah no no no like i'm saying um yeah he didn't die tea and he [ __ ]
(5:03:13) rubbed your feet and he did all the eats and he did all the [ __ ] you wanted in your nut but he also didn't allow me to
(5:03:18) do anything for him like he wanted me to be like that so and you left yeah and
(5:03:23) well i left because i don't think you could respect a man like that i just i biologically i don't think you could so
(5:03:28) hang on so to get this right the nicest guy in the world you [ __ ] left him so
(5:03:35) i left him because we were just it was amicable bit more like [ __ ] right no no no no no i i loved it i loved it i loved
(5:03:43) everything that he did for me and i'm grateful and he was a good man and so why did you leave him again uh it was
(5:03:48) like an amical thing like we were fighting because uh he truly felt like he wanted to make more money and uh i i
(5:03:57) feel like how men feel like when they aren't like are not making money like how they used to especially when they're
(5:04:03) used to making a certain amount of money um they start to get tend to get a little mean and uh i am a sensitive
(5:04:09) person like i don't like to be yelled at so when he kind of was yelling at me i was like "you've never yelled at me
(5:04:14) before." so maybe we're out of love maybe we're out of touch and he just needed time i needed time and we kept
(5:04:20) like it was just one of those things that i was like "you know what nah." so we just like i'm saying it's just the
(5:04:26) thing of like he cho he brought it up of the like do you think we need time to
(5:04:31) just be ourselves i could build my life da da da and that was it like and i mean
(5:04:38) great man he bought me a car he paid for my apartment like great man great man love him all respect to him and all
(5:04:45) power to him wherever he is with his life love he did all that and left you uh no like i'm saying it's just like i
(5:04:51) believe if you're fighting constantly in a relationship there's just something there that it's just either resentment
(5:04:58) or underlying going and getting you tai tea every day and doing all the no no no not necessarily that but like of course
(5:05:05) not that it had to be something else besides that no yeah cuz he told me well it came out of his mouth and that's what he said so i'm going to take what his
(5:05:12) word is because that's what you're going to tell me like i i respected it enough that i was like "okay if that's what you
(5:05:18) say so cool all right." like do your business go ahead build your life i
(5:05:24) guess yeah yeah yeah so i think it's interesting every single time i see these tik toks
(5:05:30) and women are like "my man does all the laundry and he does all the dishes and he does all the housework and he
(5:05:36) sexually satisfies me and he's so great." next time the very next time i talk to him like "so you guys still
(5:05:41) together?" nope i'm like "wow." i was like "yeah you're always ecstatic." you
(5:05:47) were static in this video you were like "oh my god this is so great." not with yeah and that was like i think i posted
(5:05:53) that in like 2021 so like we were just getting together and like and that's what i was saying like he didn't want me
(5:05:59) to lift a finger he truly believed like i'm a woman i'm dainty yes i can i have to cook i have to clean but he truly
(5:06:06) found he liked cooking and cleaning he would would always say it would calm him down so i i was like "okay if that's
(5:06:12) your way of calming down like i'll let you cuz was he doing drugs?" no no
(5:06:20) yeah i'm like "no no no i wasn't expecting that okay i mean that's that's really all i
(5:06:26) had on it it's just uh it's just i just find it ironic you know like i can't falsify it because um there's like
(5:06:33) there's no way to falsify but uh you know the claim that no no it was different reasons other than this
(5:06:39) that sour but ultimately all i can do is draw a link all of the various
(5:06:45) relationships where women are ecstatic because the man is a domesticated housewife essentially and then the next
(5:06:52) time you talk to him the relationship's over in fact there was recently on whatever candace remember candace brian
(5:07:00) had her little like uh list she had her little like list you get [ __ ] if you [ __ ] take out the garbage twice a
(5:07:06) week or whatever it is oh chore play chore play yeah yeah chore play yeah chore play yeah yeah yeah and and didn't
(5:07:12) wasn't there a recent divorce announced there uh yeah i'm pretty sure aren't they
(5:07:18) divorcing or something somebody i i got a bunch of dms i got a bunch of dms from people saying "yeah they're getting
(5:07:24) divorced." so damn or he initi he initiated the divorce i guess i don't know yeah he initiated it i guess he was
(5:07:31) tired of having to take out three bags of trash for a [ __ ] i guess he was pretty tired of it yeah uh let's see

(5:08:13) oh [ __ ] hold these rules uh would you uh what if a guy didn't even do that
(5:08:18) ever though the last part the last part he just didn't just never but would he
(5:08:24) expect me to give him a [ __ ] sure why not then then no i wouldn't i
(5:08:31) would i'd be like what if he didn't though what if he was like fine whatever you don't have to do it but i'm not doing it i'd be like i guess it's not

(5:09:36) online avoided signing divorce papers avoided signing divorce papers so
(5:09:41) much that he himself yikes oh my god

(5:10:09) interesting and i was only 18 at the time whoa wait huh i was only 18 at the
(5:10:15) time all all that wait is that one dude or that's different dudes that's the
(5:10:20) well no no this was wait that's that was all those things you listed that was one guy that was one guy that was the one
(5:10:26) you were in like the sevenyear relationship with you stuck around that long was he like your first i never found out it was so manipulative because
(5:10:33) uh number one like uh my parents were very like you can't have social media blah blah blah so i never really got
(5:10:39) social media and i never thought really to the thought of like oh i need to go through my cuz like i'm saying i'm if
(5:10:45) i'm getting with someone i'm going to trust them to the all ends and yeah to the all ends and all death you know so
(5:10:51) i'm going to trust him so the day i finally went through the phone after
(5:10:57) years i was like cuz i i believe i'm not a phone going througher like i guess cuz
(5:11:03) i just it's not my business like whatever is in your phone is in your phone m um yeah i wish i didn't you know
(5:11:10) no hang on how long were you with that guy seven seven years okay and then the guy who did all the tai tea and [ __ ] i
(5:11:17) met him right after actually when i was with him he decided my ex-husband decided to himself oh
(5:11:26) wait exhusband oh yeah yeah we were married oh okay yeah yeah no i get it i get it but the tight the the guy who did
(5:11:32) all the like fetching your tea and whatever the [ __ ] you wanted and ate the pee and everything how long were you
(5:11:38) with that guy yeah what about how long were you with that guy uh since 2021
(5:11:45) so we just broke things off cuz we've been uh on and off for so long that we just broke things off and i was like
(5:11:51) "dude live your life." so like uh four and a half years roughly yeah roughly four years yeah yeah so you were with
(5:11:57) the guy who treated you like absolute [ __ ] for way longer than the guy who did everything he wanted yeah but it was also like okay i started dating him in
(5:12:03) high school and well yeah like high school and he was also two years older than me and yeah so then uh like i'm
(5:12:12) saying i if i date someone i'm assuming they're a good person and i don't need to go through their phone because and
(5:12:17) and that's this was what was crazy and that's where i kind of want to say like he kind of gave christians like a bad
(5:12:22) name because he would always be like the lord made me cheat like and i'd be like no you went out there and you did it
(5:12:30) like you chose to do that there's no one in your ear telling you you need to be lustful towards a bunch of like to a
(5:12:36) bunch of women let alone to something that isn't even like so i just was like you know what so then uh yeah i tried uh
(5:12:44) leaving him obviously and then uh i met the the dude the nice dude you know shout out to real x i met the nice dude
(5:12:50) and then uh he didn't want to divorce me and i kept giving him papers like i
(5:12:56) would you know you have to pay someone to give your your divorce papers cuz you can't serve them yourself and uh i swear
(5:13:03) to god i want to say i spent like $800 in people just going to serve in papers and he would never do it and it was just
(5:13:10) like if you treated me like this for so long and it sucked too because i was finally like making a name for myself
(5:13:16) and i kind of had like my own money you know like i just just finished cool so it was like if something happens like he
(5:13:22) could take me for 50% of whatever the hell i have because i'm working so hard now and he became a bum not to say he
(5:13:29) did become a bum like afterwards but he did like so it's like i truly believe like you shouldn't do that like and
(5:13:36) whether you're a man or a female and you decide to do that like and you try to just take the easy way out and be like
(5:13:42) "well i'm going take 50%." like i worked for that like i made sure i had that and
(5:13:47) you made sure you had that and we were when we split up it's not like i was like "oh yeah i want the car i want this
(5:13:52) i want that." no i literally was like "i just want you to leave me alone." like that was all you didn't have [ __ ] to
(5:13:58) split up anyway yeah yeah exactly exactly yeah so that was it
(5:14:07) all right let's do the last tik tok thank you for thank you for sharing that oh yeah i'm gonna overshare open book
(5:14:12) open book uh let's do the next one and then video tab for this

(5:15:12) to pause okay read this i told you to calm down and let your [ __ ] anger go
(5:15:17) because it's the fact that you [ __ ] someone's whole couple months up with your bad mouth and you want them to be
(5:15:23) there for you you must be [ __ ] crazy he went to my job background that he went to my job and he tried saying that
(5:15:30) i was on drugs and everything and i was just like were you on drugs no i was not i ended up having yeah but i was going into criminology so it was like that's a
(5:15:36) bad rep you were going you were going to criminology of like you definitely weren't doing drugs yeah like come on
(5:15:42) next go ahead okay uh pause it again you knew the agreement don't play don't play
(5:15:48) me talk to me when you're ready to stop wasting my time i'm done with your victim [ __ ] he was trying to say that
(5:15:54) you know exactly next remember your search for me and any girl
(5:15:59) you meet he would say that though because every time he would cheat he'd be like "you're you're better." but i
(5:16:05) would read this i personally feel like nothing's ever going to work out and we're never and we're not good for each
(5:16:10) other and i just don't ever want to be with you why did you post this like what was the benefit would you ever be with a
(5:16:18) man who now who spoke to you the way you were speaking to him no but that's also like when you're 19
(5:16:24) and 18 i feel like you hear so many crazy things and especially like if you've never been cheated on before you
(5:16:30) don't know the type of like adrenaline is going in your body to just find that out like so i feel like and especially
(5:16:37) if you've never been cheated on you really can't speak on it because my body was trembling like i couldn't think about it and then like i said was it
(5:16:44) literally shaking yeah yeah okay how they were saying the girl was i was probably 10 times more than that and
(5:16:50) then there wasn't even like you could lie and be like i didn't cheat she's pregnant why are you using my table
(5:16:57) sorry sorry but she was pregnant so you couldn't even say followup question would you ever speak to somebody not
(5:17:03) follow okay all right followup question would i ever speak to somebody like that now no never yeah yeah yeah growth growth growth okay do do you want to ask
(5:17:09) it though cuz that was yeah yeah yeah uh here we're going to move to lydia uh pull up lydia's
(5:17:16) instagram post god sorry ratchet i was i was only 19 all right uh let's
() 
(5:17:24) go to video tab one i was never thinking uh let's go ahead and lay out and i was
(5:17:29) not let me tell you that that year i was looking to have an abortion how about i'm 34 right now my boyfriend is kind of
(5:17:36) out of the picture now so i don't really have any support it's a 4 to 5 day procedure a needle is inserted through
(5:17:43) the abdomen and into the fetal heart lidocaine is injected and that will completely numb the fetus after that we
(5:17:49) inject a medication called deoxin and another medication called kcl which will slow and then stop the fetal heartbeat
(5:17:56) and then we'll give you a medication called misoprosttol misoprosttol will sort of induce contraction will assist
(5:18:02) you in sort of pushing in the induction and then remove all of the products of conception you're definitely going to
(5:18:08) feel discomfort and cramping i've never heard ever said during we specialize in
(5:18:14) later trimester care our doctor is very well versed in what he's doing and he's very good so i'm not like a rare
(5:18:20) situation y'all help women this late in pregnancy all the time all the time can i help you i am looking you can pause it
(5:18:27) the product is crazy they called the baby the product
(5:18:32) for the pro-choicers here do you guys support late term abortion uh late term
(5:18:38) no unless like it's something crazy like the like the mom is going to die but in
(5:18:43) reality i truly feel like you should check wait can you just scoot into the procedure to save a woman's life in that
(5:18:49) late in pregnancy is a preterm delivery so they don't have to directly see then that's it yeah but i don't support late
(5:18:54) term late term yeah no late term no that's when do you think it should be legal uh i feel like as soon as you find
(5:19:01) out and right away what if you don't find out though cuz
(5:19:07) there's crypt cryptic pregnancies what if you don't find out until birth like right you're giving birth yeah can you peel the baby as it should yeah it's too
(5:19:14) late after a certain amount of weeks what's the what is like yeah what's the actual thingy i'm not too versed on it
(5:19:20) but i know that there's like they say you shouldn't do it i know that there's a development state and yeah it's like a
(5:19:27) couple maybe like couple months i'm not quite sure but i just know that there was a certain 25 weeks i believe it is
(5:19:35) for for what that the fetus can live outside oh 21 weeks is when they can live outside the womb so would you say
(5:19:41) that that's when you think uh pro probably before that before it could if
(5:19:47) it can live outside then just have it you know like and then give it you know to adoption but but it's yeah if it if
(5:19:53) it can live outside just give it a life and then you know do that but if it can't then you know it's early enough
(5:19:59) wait i have a question lydia okay so since you're like pro like life and everything do you like go to the foster
(5:20:04) homes and like help out or like do you go to like the like the kids that have been like born with like drugs like drug
(5:20:10) abused parents and like do you like at least do that type of charity work too so i actually was pro-choice and became
(5:20:16) pro-life because of my foster sister because pro-choicers would tell me that she's better off aborted and so i became
(5:20:21) pro-life in high school realized that um abortion is eliminating foster children
(5:20:26) instead of helping them um and yeah a lot of our pro-life laws actually work to fund and fix the foster care system
(5:20:32) help pregnancy centers um my pro-life law in north carolina gave millions of dollars towards those things so we do
(5:20:38) care um but for the record um abortion is the leading cause of death in the history of the world so it's my greatest
(5:20:45) focus um in my work um but by the way that's uh that's good work like that's
(5:20:51) good work that you're doing um and uh i you know wish you god speed in continuing it because it's [ __ ]
(5:20:57) monstrous they they say 34 weeks 34 weeks yep that that is just [ __ ] evil
(5:21:05) um so so to to chair one though uh i got to ask you a question like let's just
(5:21:10) say for a second she didn't let's just say for a second she didn't support foster care and she wasn't out you know
(5:21:17) feeding homeless children or doing any [ __ ] like that why in the world would that matter the idea of not being able
(5:21:24) to kill a 34w week old no no obviously the 34 i did say 34 is crazy 34 was
(5:21:30) crazy not be evil and not also support foster children because she doesn't have time like why would that even be a
(5:21:36) problem or a contradiction because i think a lot of people when they don't support abortion i mean when they don't
(5:21:41) support when they support abortion or they don't support abortion they're just kind of like okay well that's still an
(5:21:47) unwanted child like so the child's going to feel unwanted wherever it's at and i
(5:21:53) mean the foster home is like the first place that they go if they don't go to adoption and so that's why i think like
(5:21:58) they should at least worry about that well i just want to let you know that 100% of the babies in the united states
(5:22:04) put up for adoption or adopted there's 30 couples waiting to adopt for every newborn put up for to get approved yeah
(5:22:09) yeah i know that was me yeah that's that's one and the second is it still wouldn't be a contradiction in her
(5:22:15) worldview even if she didn't now she said she did i don't take her at her word but even if she didn't there's
(5:22:21) nothing contradictory about saying "hey you're not allowed to murder 34 babies."
(5:22:26) uh because i don't want to go support foster kids like there's still no contradiction there i just want to point
(5:22:32) that out to you absolutely would you ask uh someone who's working to cure cancer why they haven't helped with diabetes
(5:22:37) yet it's just something that i focus yeah but that's like stem cells and everything so like you can't well that
(5:22:42) that's the whole thing is that i'm focused on one thing and i absolutely do care about other things but i don't have
(5:22:48) to solve every world problem in order to know that killing babies is wrong when when do you think focus on the problems
(5:22:54) you can solve right when do you think that it should be legal to have an abortion at what stage oh what do you
(5:23:00) mean stage what stage of pregnancy like ages well i think just barely like before the first like seven weeks 10
(5:23:06) weeks okay so the earliest yeah yeah yeah that's why it's like i'm not a hater yeah yeah no no definitely yeah i
() 
(5:23:13) i no no no no girl i'm super open but that's what i'm saying like 34 that's why i was like 34 weeks is crazy that's
(5:23:19) like pretty much you're about to deliver like that's insane yeah might as well just go through with it like you already
(5:23:24) did all the stretching like so is 30 weeks yeah so it's 30 so it's 28 weeks and so and from the very from the very
(5:23:31) moment of conception 95% of biologists agree that it's a human life it meets all seven characteristics of life you do
(5:23:38) not have to be a christian to know that killing babies is wrong it's a biological fact as well um and so it
(5:23:43) doesn't matter what stage of development you are in it does not determine your value and no matter when an abortion is
(5:23:49) performed that is still killing an innocent human being can i add something um first of all if you squash an bald
(5:23:56) eagle egg you get f fined like what $250,000 cuz they're endangered it's cuz
(5:24:03) they're endangered well humans are getting endangered that's very true what so so hang on but what they're
(5:24:09) doing though she makes a valid point right because what they're doing is they're saying "well wait this isn't a bald eagle life yet just the potential
(5:24:16) to be bald eagle life." and since bald eagles are endangered just the potential
(5:24:21) they will become bald eagles is enough for you to fit the crime of essentially murdering a bald eagle right i've
(5:24:28) actually point it's a good point i've never actually heard that argument that's pretty
(5:24:34) have you heard that one oh yeah i just literally posted you can look on instagram i just posted it like a couple days ago i'm sorry i didn't i didn't see
(5:24:41) it you're so yeah go to prison you can go to prison
(5:24:47) for destroying an eagle egg but it is your right and freedom to kill an innocent child another thing i would
(5:24:52) like to add is the argument people use against that is oh the egg is separate from the mother well it still needs the mother and the parent to survive and
(5:24:59) another thing is you guys always not you guys people on the left typically bring up foster system as
(5:25:06) a abortion should we just go shoot up orphanages i don't think that's right what the [ __ ] but honestly like with a
(5:25:12) shooting i don't think you should talk about shootings with everything language on because of the to loaded language i'm sorry um but what
(5:25:21) i'm trying to say is i have two adopted sisters and stuff their life is no less
(5:25:26) valuable than mine because they were chosen not to be kept and stuff and the
(5:25:32) fact that people they they talk about choosing between an unborn child or a 5-year-old and something you're change
(5:25:38) you're ignoring the fact that that unborn child has the potential to be that 5-year-old it can ch it could cure
(5:25:44) cancer or probably killed the cure for cancer yeah that's a purpose from god the circumstances of your life do not
(5:25:50) determine your value and back to you i'm i'm curious oh sorry you said you were pro-choice would you now say that you're
(5:25:57) pro-life you um honestly i mean pro-life it to a point an extent just because uh
(5:26:04) i not going to like open my book too much but like with essay and stuff you know like i just personally believe like
(5:26:11) there's some things that just it's sick obviously but it just sucks yeah but
(5:26:17) that's not that child's fault can i ask you a quick question yeah would the world be a better or worse place if you
(5:26:23) had been aborted i don't think the world cares enough about me to answer my question be a
() 
(5:26:30) better or a worse place if do you think neutral so you say your life doesn't
(5:26:35) matter not that it doesn't matter but there's too many other things in the world going on for my own life i only
(5:26:41) matter to the people around me yeah so raise your hand if you think that the world would be better a better place if
(5:26:46) you had been aborted that alone should generally just
(5:26:51) end the argument right but the thing is is that it doesn't which is insane to me like just the very idea that none of the
(5:26:59) people who advocate on behalf of abortion think the world be worse if they weren't in it i think that that's
(5:27:05) insanity right you're eliminating the same potentiality that other people can make impacts in a world on par with
(5:27:10) yours which are good i i want to address the argument you just brought up in the
(5:27:16) case of essay um it's a terrible thing no prolifer ever wants a woman to get pregnant in the situation um but
(5:27:22) abortion does not undo that trauma it may add more trauma because abortion itself is traumatic yeah and if we're
(5:27:27) not even going to give the death penalty to the horrific person that committed this crime against her why would we give
(5:27:33) the death penalty to an innocent child for the crimes of their father but then that goes back to i believe the death penalty for anybody that does essay but
(5:27:39) do you think the death the death penalty should be given to an innocent child for the crimes of their father no but i believe it's the woman's choice
(5:27:45) regardlessly a choice to do what though to if she wants to keep the baby or not not just abort it that's what i'm saying
(5:27:51) keep the baby or not 44% of women regret their abortions then see then i'm i wish they would have
(5:27:57) thought it a little bit more through she's got the stats i got that's what i'm saying i wish you would i wish women
(5:28:03) would truly think about it because there's i like exactly i think abigail said it or someone said it but there is some women that like try to joke about
(5:28:11) it and like try to be like he he what have you had an abortion no i've actually actually never been pregnant
(5:28:17) either so yeah so you never had an abortion well but i know people that have yeah yeah no
(5:28:23) no i get it i understand that right but don't you think that a lot of times women have abortions and then feel like
(5:28:30) there's no going back because they have to endlessly justify it for the rest of their lives yeah but see that's exactly why justify it if you are truly getting
(5:28:37) you should literally stick it in your brain and be like i have a baby inside me i have a baby inside me this is going
(5:28:43) to be a baby will i do this to myself and if they are willing to sit there with themselves and be like "okay i will
(5:28:52) do it i will take this." then i guess whatever empathy or whatever type of
(5:28:57) mood and whatever type of emotions they're feeling i'm not here i'm not
(5:29:02) here to confuse someone else's emotions hang on hang on hang on last question i have for you okay what would change your
(5:29:08) mind on this issue what thing could be said as an argument that if you heard it
(5:29:15) right would reconcile this in your brain so that it would settle the issue for you what would that be um i think the
(5:29:23) biggest thing and this is also something i do say too women that have abortions usually cannot conceive a child the same
(5:29:30) way they did with the first one they usually tend to have problems like complications once you have an abortion
(5:29:36) there is more risk to your next pregnancy does not answer my question what thing could i this is the final
(5:29:43) question of the belief that this is okay what is that thing and then if i refute
(5:29:49) that thing will you change your mind on this issue yeah but i just can't think of a thing like that right now you can't think of a
(5:29:55) thing so you're holding on passionately to an issue even [ __ ] know why you don't even know why no i just know
(5:30:02) enough like to the point where i mean like i'm saying i don't i'm not here to tell you though how you feel the stance
(5:30:08) you have no idea i know but that exactly but like i'm saying i'm not i'm not a therapist i'm not someone to be like "oh
(5:30:14) my god let me here to convince you." therapist know because it's just somebody else's views i'm not i'm not
(5:30:19) going to press if i could prove that it was a human being to you would you become pro-life from the moment of
(5:30:24) conception yeah if my brain could register it yeah but okay every biology textbook says a human life begins at
(5:30:30) fertilization at fertilization they meet all seven characteristics of life you have your own separate dna everything
(5:30:36) about you your sex hair color eye color was determined at the moment of conception you were you and you were valuable and you were a human life that
(5:30:42) deserves equal human rights okay bars it's true do you agree with that same thing with animals oh yeah same thing
(5:30:48) with animals yeah yeah yeah absolutely wait do you do you agree with her i said okay yeah are you pro life now but so if
(5:30:55) it feel better you said if there was i still have different views i still have different views on different situations but do you do so you disagree with
(5:31:01) science then that it's not a human life there's a lot of science i guess i wouldn't say i disagree on it but wait
(5:31:07) wait wait hold on biology is not a soft science biology is a hard science yes i have the studies right now if you would
(5:31:12) like to look at them uh but you guys are going to waste more time trying to convince me than me trying to learn it
(5:31:18) on myself on my own but you did you did just say if like this was the standard then it would change your mind on
(5:31:24) abortion she just established that it was yeah and i said but what did i what i said i said if you could and run the
(5:31:30) clip back i said if you could actually if my brain can process it right now then yeah i will change my mind in 2.3
(5:31:36) seconds once you tell me if you want to know the anti- women voting argument the
(5:31:41) main one of rationality is that women will often hold to stances which are
(5:31:48) illogical based on emotion and this pure emotion pure [ __ ] emotion no stance
(5:31:54) based in logic reason you can't refute a stance based in uh nonrational emotional
(5:32:01) thinking right and this is why those all those repeal the 19th which by the way again i'm saying i want to limit
(5:32:08) suffrage for everybody because i just think it's a bad idea that everybody votes in this i think that's stupid but
(5:32:13) when it comes to this with chair one like look at the rationality no rationality whatsoever holding to a
(5:32:19) stance at a period yeah but i hold it to the stance just because of the certain types of topics like i told her it's not
(5:32:25) like i'm over here like "oh my god you should do it at any age at any given week." but that's rational you don't
(5:32:30) have a rational reason why you hold the stand tell me the rational reason you hold this stance what is it because i
(5:32:36) believe it's my own body and i should have my own teeth it's not your it's not your body it's a baby's body that's
(5:32:42) being hurt and killed by inside of my body and it will not be procre so it will not be creating without me so a
(5:32:48) child's dependency on their mother's body to survive is a death sentence no it's not a death sentence because a
(5:32:55) newborn baby also relies then there's those women there's those women that have children and then they're mean as
(5:33:00) [ __ ] and abusive to their children because they never want so they're better off to be mothers we're not forcing anyone to be mothers we just
(5:33:07) want to hold them accountable for their decision pro-choice pro-schoice means you could give your baby up for adoption
(5:33:12) you could get an abortion or you could keep it that's a choice killing shouldn't be a choice though there's three choices yeah it shouldn't be an
(5:33:18) option because the baby but it's the fact that it is and the only person that could really tell me something is lydia
() 
(5:33:24) because she's the only one out there in the government area being like "yeah this is what i'm going to do." so until you actually have put that on your
(5:33:30) resume lydia i have a government area yeah in the government specific in the
(5:33:35) government area i understand that you're you're a very staunch anti-abortion advocate i have a hypothetical for you
(5:33:42) for me as yeah for you which has been bothersome to me okay i had to think
(5:33:47) about it for a long time um because it was it was actually difficult for me to reconcile you believe life begins at
(5:33:54) conception yeah okay so then an in vitro fertilization
(5:33:59) clinic all of those eggs have been fertilized right yep absolutely so an in vitro fertilization clinic is on fire
(5:34:06) there's a 2-year-old who's in there and he's crying and there's thousands of eggs next to him would you save the
(5:34:13) thousands of eggs or would you grab the 2-year-old if you could only choose one i i don't think it changes the argument
(5:34:19) and here's why in the titanic when it was sinking they chose to save the women and children first like we talked about
(5:34:25) earlier does that mean that the men are worth less no absolutely not that's but
(5:34:31) that but wait there's a rationale behind that which is based around social duty
(5:34:36) valuation that you're talking about is equality in life after and before the effect of birth this is the argument for
(5:34:44) being uh pro-life from your stance so these fertilized eggs have as much
(5:34:51) ontological value as that 2-year-old so justify how it would be that you would
(5:34:56) grab the 2-year-old i don't i don't know what i'd do in that situation but um i think i i think um if you had to i i i
(5:35:04) don't i i don't think it at the end of the day first of all we have an emotional response to gravitate towards
(5:35:09) a screaming 2-year-old who can um feel pain has conscious ability to experience
(5:35:15) what's happening um whereas um 2-year-old can't feel pain and he's not
(5:35:21) crying yeah and yeah that might be part of the consideration it still doesn't change the argument though they're still equally valuable for instance if i have
(5:35:28) my own two 2-year-old and there's a bunch of other 2-year-olds that are not mine in the corner i might be conflicted
(5:35:35) about who to save doesn't change the argument that they're all equally valuable they're all equally living human beings yeah but i'm not disputing
(5:35:42) that within the worldview they're all equally valuable the dispute comes in as
(5:35:47) to why the intuition would be for most people to go for the 2-year-old yeah
(5:35:52) instead of the eggs why it would be that most people wouldn't cry over the fact or for instance let me give you an
(5:35:58) example a nurse carelessly knocks over a bunch of fertilized eggs did she just murder a ton of people i it well
(5:36:05) accidentally but yes those are i mean that's why i the ivf industry is extremely problematic because they're
(5:36:11) creating all of these millions of um babies in embryionic form and then freezing some of them destroying a bunch
(5:36:18) of them um practicing eugenics on them by selecting the ones that are um a certain sex or um have certain genetic
(5:36:25) capabilities and that's why the ivf industry is how person if they knocked over that tray of eggs right fertilized
(5:36:32) eggs and they all broke would feel in any way the same conditional that they would if they just saw for instance like
(5:36:38) i don't know 102 year olds get butchered in this right yeah i mean they probably wouldn't feel the same way because it doesn't have the same level of
(5:36:45) experiences you might feel different that's why we can't base the pro-life argument on emotion it's based on uh
(5:36:50) logic and facts and biology that says it's a human life in the in the womb yeah that's true but intuition also
(5:36:56) informs what you're when you're talking about moral codes when you're talking about the ideas of how people
(5:37:02) interpersonally relate i think it's just because intuitively you're like if you asked a person almost
(5:37:09) any person this question would you rather if you had to choose right 1002y
(5:37:16) olds get butchered in front of you right or 1,000 inseminated eggs get dumped on
(5:37:22) the ground i think almost every human being you ask that question to is going to choose the eggs getting dumped on the
(5:37:28) ground right right yeah so it seems to be counterintuitive a bit to the log logic now i i agree with you by the way
(5:37:35) 100% agree with you that you you are logically consistent i'm just saying that in this the intuition side is very
(5:37:42) difficult to logically reconcile absolutely yeah no i think it's because we're kind of hardwired to emotionally
(5:37:48) respond to a screaming toddler in the way that we do where we can't see we can't see a human and embryionic form to
(5:37:55) the same degree we can't see the emotion on their face it's harder to empathize with that which is why abortion is so
(5:38:03) normalized partially because we can't see that baby in the womb people think it's genuinely a clump of cells i mean i
(5:38:08) who was raised a christian had no idea that abortion was wrong for a while because society has just normalized it
(5:38:14) it's so easy to dehumanize them when we can't see them with our own eyes and we can't um empathize as well with it so i
(5:38:21) mean i i agree with you it's it's difficult um but no it doesn't change their value at the end of the day can i
(5:38:26) add something i've heard that they're using like aborted babies eggs for ivf do you know if that's true aborted b
(5:38:33) what do you mean by that aborted babies like late term abortions and they're using their eggs for ivf i've just heard that randomly so so they do a lot of
(5:38:40) different experiments on aborted babies body parts unfortunately um it's
(5:38:46) disturbing i have not heard specifically of them somehow creating final final thought goes to abigail go ahead and
(5:38:52) then i'm moving it on i i do want to know andrew if somebody used the argument that you just asked her to
(5:38:59) dispute your pro-life argument how would you argue that question that you just
(5:39:05) well no that would be telling oh man but i want to know like all andrew wilson's
(5:39:11) logical weapons are there for andrew wilson to deploy at the right time against the right person but i did feel
(5:39:17) that chair three i i felt like giving a little bit because there's nobody else to give any push back um i think it's
(5:39:23) fair to push people even that you agree with on their logical consistency and why they think the things that they
(5:39:28) think there was nobody else here to do it so unfortunately it falls to me to do right um even if i completely agree with
(5:39:35) the stance right but i've heard tons of compelling uh pro-choice arguments that
(5:39:41) can be difficult to reconcile you know what i mean like um well there's there's a bunch i can get into but definitely um
(5:39:49) not going to give you give away the andrew wilson logical weapons of mass destruction today so don't don't you
(5:39:56) think you should be helping educate people on how to debunk the pro-life or pro-choice argument of course
(5:40:04) so it's good to share your knowledge then right i'm i'm curious i want to hear how you doesn't mean i'm going to
(5:40:09) share it with you so the thing is is like i'm going to look it up i think you can ask i think i think you're doing a
(5:40:16) fantastic job right in and what you're doing and i i mean god speed to you 100%
(5:40:23) support from us here at the crucible to you especially calling that calling those people exposing that so that
(5:40:29) people can see i've heard leftists say this isn't even a thing that happens there is no such thing as late term
(5:40:35) abortion you're making it up like i've heard all of that [ __ ] so i think what you're doing the lord's work here in
(5:40:40) this capacity right but when you have nukes you save them for the right moment
(5:40:46) to drop them where they're the most useful instead of somebody else taking them messing them all up and then the
(5:40:52) left is ready for them i just don't what what was it a thousand embryo or what
(5:40:57) was it a thousand are you talking about the burning ivf clinic analogy yeah it was a thousand yeah it's like yeah a
(5:41:03) thousand uh embryos fertilized embryos versus screaming
(5:41:09) 2-year-old burning building all right let's see what ai says to this andrew uh oh ai is usually pro-choice you got to
(5:41:16) look into this because somebody's going to hit you with that question hit me with what the question that he oh the burning ivf plan no i always just say
(5:41:22) that it doesn't matter who you choose to save they're still equally valuable just like it just because you save the women and children first on the titanic he
(5:41:28) came back with the intuition your intuition logically consistent but it's unintuitive to convince but that still
(5:41:35) doesn't take that still doesn't defeat the abortion uh the pro-life stance no i
(5:41:40) agree but somebody's going to ask it's not a defeater listen it's not a defeater but you have to understand when
(5:41:45) you're convinc well and you probably do know this when you're convincing people that right like for instance you were
(5:41:51) trying to have a logical deductive argument uh based on induction and deductive reasoning with one somebody
(5:41:58) who is passionately emotionally attached to a position they respond to rhetoric
(5:42:03) often over even logical consistency nobody's refuting that you have a logically consistent stance you most
(5:42:10) certainly do right but it's are are you convincing people uh through rhetoric
(5:42:17) who cannot be convinced through logic and this is a weapon deployed by the left often uh rhetorically which stays
(5:42:24) in the convincing category of people who don't either a have the capacity for
(5:42:30) logically inductive argumentation or deductive uh or they're just passionate
(5:42:35) about it from an emotional stance it's like that's the point of rhetoric so as socrates pointed out rightfully rhetoric
(5:42:42) is anything which convinces a person whatever that is that's rhetoric and so
(5:42:47) um i think it is a powerful rhetorical tool on their side not a powerful logical one and i don't think it debunks
(5:42:53) you at all yeah yeah absolutely all right uh we have some chats that i need
(5:42:59) to uh get to uh but you know what i we're going to do the roast session in a bit guys so we're going to bump the tts

(5:43:48) is okay that's weird uh so going around the table perfect man for life or perfect career for life perfect man
() 
(5:43:54) perfect man man man man man man man
(5:43:59) okay all right thank you glavius for that appreciate it we have dalamar ban abortions banan birth control 65 million
(5:44:06) dead americans in the 40 years of roie wayade 98.7% were for convenience of having sex
(5:44:12) for fun two generations were gutted on the altar of female choice all right
(5:44:17) delmare thanks for the message really appreciate it and then uh i'll let our first roast come through which is oh
(5:44:26) [ __ ] i forgot to change the tts hold on one sec i'll just brian have you lost
(5:44:31) weight ah [ __ ] here let me i'm going to fix it uh so guys tts is being lowered to uh $30 $30 $29.99 if you want to get
(5:44:41) a roast in get it in we're going to be doing that we have a couple more things to get through a couple uh reacts and

(5:45:52) into me with some burrito memeing so uh but yeah feel free to roast me um uh oh
(5:45:59) let me let this one come through okay wait is it not oh my goodness i
(5:46:05) guess i i don't know how to operate my oh here's what happened i know why okay sorry scuffed all right it should go
(5:46:12) through this time let's see here uh the pseudo master chief chef excuse me thank you master chief donated $29.99
(5:46:21) brian have you lost weight any strange feelings i need to though i snuck in the
(5:46:27) studio and put omic in all the food covering the burrito but all right all right if they
(5:46:33) send in the scumbag i will give you sorry go ahead the champagne pop if they send in the champagne pop i will give
(5:46:40) the answer to the hypothetical i like it i like it all right beautiful uh okay so
(5:46:48) few more notes here uh let's see we did uh you know what yeah let's just go to
(5:46:54) the megan kelly thing i think that's interesting and it's kind of related to the career versus family conversation we
(5:47:00) were having earlier go ahead pull that up yes yes please uh we'll go video tab on it guys
(5:47:07) like the video enjoy the stream uh oh wait is this it
() 
(5:47:13) uh yeah just let's go ahead and play it here's what's happening on pause it pause it uh go full screen it's that
(5:47:19) full the far yep all right go ahead young women i and i talk to young conservative women all the time about
(5:47:25) their lives and their goals and you know the things that they want and what's happening is they can't find men who are
(5:47:34) maybe more conservative usually they're looking for somebody who is religious you know like they're a lot of
(5:47:40) conservative women tend to be god god loving uh conservatives and they can't
(5:47:46) find a lot of young men who want to marry a working woman now this is an actual problem that's that's coming up
(5:47:52) on the right and to me it's so sad because it's like how did we get to the point where we we're now telling young
(5:48:00) conservative amazing women that they're not attractive if they also work if they
(5:48:07) choose to let's say do what i'm doing and what you're doing and like get their voice out there but i'll stick with me
(5:48:12) just because i think conservatives listening to this will like the thought of another megan kelly voice up and
(5:48:18) coming well why wouldn't we want that why would we take somebody who's talented in this field and really wants
(5:48:24) to make a difference and have the messaging to her be you're really not that valuable unless you give it up and
(5:48:31) go into the home and only have a family and only raise a family and the and not only were we sending her that message
(5:48:37) but young men are actually believing that they they're actually believing it especially on the right because like the
(5:48:43) trd mom has gotten so popular and it's like no if we do that we're not going to have any strong conservative or
(5:48:50) right-leaning women to provide a role model for younger conservative women who
(5:48:57) and there's nothing to apologize for here don't necessarily want to spend all
(5:49:02) their 20s and their 30s getting married and and having kids or can't they just
(5:49:07) weren't able to meet somebody and definitely don't need to be shamed over it another
(5:49:15) i think that was it right okay uh reactions reactions from the panel agree disagree
(5:49:23) oo 5050 i agree to an extent i think you could but i think you can still work and
(5:49:28) be a voice and still have be a a mom a present mom for instance at my
(5:49:34) organization we're full of women who are pro-life activists and many of our staffers who are moms bring their babies
(5:49:40) to go and table on college campuses to educate people um and i mean my my staff
(5:49:46) likes to joke about how one day when i do have kids i can bring my real life baby model instead of my fetal models
(5:49:53) around and um talk about babies with my actual baby when i'm on college campuses so you can absolutely do both you can be
(5:49:59) a voice a conservative voice because i do think that's important and i do i do think we need um especially um
(5:50:06) conservative pro-life christian women to be voices out there it's very important
(5:50:11) um but no i think you can still do both you can still be a mother and do that at the same time uh pull up the uh pull
(5:50:17) that back up oh uh go back to the other one though go f11 my bad uh so we're
(5:50:23) going to read uh scroll up
(5:50:28) uh i don't get this tradife trend why do men want to revert to the 1950s when
(5:50:33) women oh okay this what is okay uh tab over to the next
(5:50:39) one men aren't didn't wait matt walsh responded to this what tab over to the
(5:50:45) next one uh this is okay i'm going to read this
(5:50:50) from matt walsh then we'll maybe do the video he says "the difference between the romantic interests of men and women
(5:50:58) could perhaps best be summarized this way if you give a man a choice between an attractive sweet kind feminine grocery store cashier who makes $13 an
(5:51:06) hour and wants nothing more than to become a mother one day or a high-powered ambitious loud rich corporate girl boss whose greatest dream
(5:51:13) is to be a ceo one day most men will choose the former without hesitation." if you give women the same choice the
(5:51:18) mildmannered uh scroll down unambitious guy working a cash register the highly paid corporate
(5:51:24) go-getter you're going to have a lot more takers for the latter option am i saying that most women are greedy gold
(5:51:29) diggers looking wait this is just from his video isn't it maybe we should just play his video uh scroll down a little
(5:51:34) bit scroll to the very bottom okay oh no no no don't don't uh let's go back to
(5:51:40) the video then why don't we just play the video uh yeah and then f11 by the way
(5:51:45) rachel ratioed both of those women on those post oh nice uh then go to video
(5:51:51) tab and then hit play all right a man is not looking for
(5:51:57) a business partner he's not looking for someone to provide for him he wants a
(5:52:03) wife he wants a mother for his future children he wants a helpmate he wants a
(5:52:09) woman not a man this is not a new phenomenon megan calls this desire of young men a problem that is coming up on
(5:52:16) the right but it's not a problem and it's not coming up kim iverson responded
(5:52:21) in an agreement with megan and said that she quote doesn't get this tradife trend
(5:52:27) but what she's calling a trend or what megan says is just coming up is in fact the norm it's the way human society has
(5:52:34) been organized since the dawn of civilization a young man seeking a woman who will have his children and
(5:52:40) prioritize raising them and keeping a home is doing the same thing that billions of other young men have done
(5:52:46) since time immemorial this traditional approach is not some new fad invented by
(5:52:52) tik tok influencers nor is it a far-right conspiracy it is the way of human civilization these young men they
(5:52:59) want what their grandfathers wanted and what their grandfather's grandfathers wanted and what their grandfather's
(5:53:04) grandfather's grandfathers wanted and on and on through the ages the trend the fad the new thing megan is
(5:53:12) feminism however you feel about career women who find their value and purpose in the working world there's no question
(5:53:19) that they are the ones doing something new feminism sent women out of the home
(5:53:25) and into cubicles and boardrooms feminism convinced many women to desire professional success over and above
(5:53:31) family and children and now feminists are angry that men were not reprogrammed along with them
(5:53:37) okay men bars don't want what feminism is selling you may think they should
(5:53:43) want it you may want them to want it but they don't they look out and they see
(5:53:49) that ever since the rise of feminism divorce rates have skyrocketed birth rates have plummeted 60 million babies are dead and most people are by every
(5:53:55) metric much more miserable and they don't want that you cannot make them want it and getting angry at them for
(5:54:01) not wanting it is first of all fruitless second arrogant third unfair and fourth foolish he's so quick because these
(5:54:09) young men that megan is referring to have an innate desire to be providers okay they that's why they are
(5:54:17) not especially interested in women who put their careers first they want to provide the desire to provide is a noble
(5:54:25) desire even if many of these men will end up splitting the financial load with their wives in some way still the desire
(5:54:31) to provide is noble and it should be encouraged not shamed it's not sad
(5:54:37) there's nothing sad here megan these young men are experiencing a deep ancient yearning a yearning to leave
(5:54:43) home and find a wife and become one flesh as the scripture says and then to have children and carry on their
(5:54:49) bloodline and then to go back out into the world on a mission to provide for their family thereby fulfilling their
(5:54:54) destiny as men this desire is primal and timeless it is not a primal timeless
(5:54:59) desire for a colleague or a business partner it is a desire for a wife a woman he can provide for and fight for
(5:55:07) and conquer the world for and in return in return he
(5:55:12) wants a woman who will have his children and raise and love them and prioritize
(5:55:18) them above anything and show him appreciation and respect and
(5:55:24) affection that's what young men want that's what any man wants almost every young man wants this uh until our
(5:55:34) feminist matriarchal society beats it out of him or convinces him that he can never have it he can never have the
(5:55:41) thing that his grandfather had and that his grandfather's grandfather's had and his grandfather's grandfather's had and
(5:55:46) on and on and on so if you want to know why so many young men are demoralized and depressed and broken it's because
(5:55:54) for their whole lives they've been told that what they want down at the deepest level of their soul they should not want
(5:56:00) and they cannot have every man before them in history could have it but not
(5:56:06) them we're too enlightened for that now the feminists took over and they know better they know better than our
(5:56:12) ancestors knew they know better than the combined wisdom of all human history do we sell pizza that's the message that
(5:56:19) these young men here yes but i can after the show you want to talk about sad megan that's sad
(5:56:28) uh reactions reactions reactions that was so
(5:56:33) beautiful yeah i agree completely with him i agree with him reactions i think he's allowed to you know i agree with
(5:56:40) you he's allowed to say that um what do you think i think sorry lauren i thought the line was interesting where it's like
(5:56:46) every man is going to have the desire to provide and that's a great thing but he'll have to end up sharing the financial responsibility with his wife
(5:56:52) in some cases and i think that's just a situation that like sadly modern day people have to be prepared for so in
(5:56:59) that case if you're would you take the grocery store cashier that's making $13 an hour would that be the amount of time
(5:57:05) and hours she has to work be a relevant use of time compared to when she could be taking care of your children but she
(5:57:10) can't because she has to do both so i would prioritize in just all of tonight's conversation an educated
(5:57:17) woman that may have to work but still loves family and wants to spend time with her kids there's a balance for it all
(5:57:23) yes yeah i agree with that i don't agree with it i don't think it's
(5:57:30) bal i don't think it's balanced at all i think look there's no good way to
(5:57:36) reconcile that if you can spend the most amount of time with your children than you should oh there's no just no way to
(5:57:43) reconcile it any other direction than that and the thing is is that most people can and don't instead what they
(5:57:50) do is they prioritize themselves and they and then they do outsourcing to
(5:57:56) prioritize themselves they won't take material cuts they won't live a little smaller they won't have the not a luxury
(5:58:02) automobile they won't have the you know not netflix whatever it is within the
(5:58:07) budgetary confines in order to materially pursue something and it's like i don't really think it's a give
(5:58:13) and take and i don't think it's about balance i think it's basically there's one way which is always correct which is
(5:58:19) to prioritize towards the children even if it's at the expense of the parents yeah totally but that's just matt's
(5:58:26) example i think it deserves to be said so do you still want to be a boss babe
(5:58:34) not when it comes at the expense of my children but i am perfectly happy having a career until i reach that point
(5:58:41) but i guess this all stems from when we were talking about the relationship status you were dating a guy for two
(5:58:46) years and there was so there's the mismatch when it came to religion he was mormon you're not mormon mismatch there
(5:58:54) but i guess what seems to have led to the breakup really wasn't so much that it
(5:59:02) was he wanted kids he wanted to get married the timeline was different because if it was the mormon thing
(5:59:09) although look to be charitable um maybe you fell more into your faith i don't
(5:59:14) maybe i shouldn't have presented that argument for you before you brought it up but uh you would have known he was
(5:59:21) mormon right away wouldn't you but you proceeded to date him for two years
(5:59:26) despite this so at least the way you presented it it occurs to me that the primary thing was you wanted to boss
(5:59:34) babe it up he wanted to have family kids marriage quick is that fair to say no
(5:59:42) and i'd prefer to not use that scenario it's honestly just too complicated to talk about here mostly a religious thing
(5:59:49) um okay what did you disagree with him on the religion i don't want to get into it
(5:59:55) okay sorry um but i'm just confused like so you knew when you first met him he
(6:00:03) was mormon right if that's a dealbreaker why did you date him um i think we both just thought we each
(6:00:09) other could change um i think he thought i could change i thought i could see change in him and ultimately it it
(6:00:16) didn't work out well change what religion more religious comp compatibility i mean i feel like maybe
(6:00:23) you could get somebody to like pick up after themselves but to change their religion it's a common thing christian
(6:00:29) girls will do missionary dating where they date a guy to try and convert him it's terrible it is very true like if
(6:00:34) he's an atheist or or even just like different like it's totally a thing like i
(6:00:40) i so christian girls are like dating muslims that's not going to work out thinking that they're not like muslims
(6:00:46) just people that aren't as strong in their faith and we women think that we can make a difference but mormonism is
(6:00:52) like a different faith isn't it you guys do recognize that that's terrible yes oh yes absolutely you say you you recognize
(6:00:58) that that's terrible oh yeah oh yeah that's why yeah that's why i brought it up um okay well uh okay
(6:01:08) okay all right um i just don't know about the whole boss babe thing it's okay
(6:01:16) all right uh well i mean i don't know any other boss babes at the table i
(6:01:21) think i'm a boss babe a little bit but not a little bit i mean i plan on working when i have kids so a teeny bit
(6:01:28) okay boss babe [ __ ] all right that's cool um what was there another video
(6:01:33) there was no i don't think well i mean we could actually react to andrew do you
(6:01:39) have andrew do you know if you have like a short one or two minute clip with your thing with tommy
(6:01:44) lauren um i i don't i don't have one handy know i would have sent one over if
(6:01:49) he had let me know um well what essentially was maybe instead of watching the video maybe we could do
(6:01:55) that next time what was your disagreement with tommy i asked tommy what uh social what was
(6:02:03) the actual social duties that women had in society which was on par with men's social duties and she said essentially
(6:02:10) nothing tommy lauren essentially her position was men want to do this and the
(6:02:16) reward that they get is they get to see me happy isn't that great oh yes so we kind of talked about that
(6:02:22) earlier i think yeah we okay all right well then though it did spin it did span into to other things um right but but
(6:02:29) yeah i mean that was the the root of the argument um and the root the root of
() 
(6:02:34) most of these arguments when it comes to the social dynamics between men and women is that for a long time men have
(6:02:41) been getting the [ __ ] kicked out of them in society as being the expendable class of society and and this has been under
(6:02:48) the guise of acting as though there was some authoritative patriarchy who instead was oppressing women and the
(6:02:54) opposite has always been true that under men's authority women thrive and so the
(6:03:00) that that that's been the idea socially for a long time sure and we've been able now to begin to take this inverted idea
(6:03:07) and reverse it to where it's actually supposed to be which is like no it turns out men being in charge of [ __ ]
() 
(6:03:14) everything is a really really good idea it's just a really good idea for society
(6:03:19) and when you look at all the numbers all the stats all the data all of the various uh uh effects and outcomes turns
(6:03:27) out that men are really good at this [ __ ] and women really aren't and that's it and there's not really good arguments
(6:03:34) against that and women have social privilege in society which is needed because they have to reproduce the next
(6:03:40) generation but they're [ __ ] not and so why aren't they right and do they have an obligation to and the answer for
(6:03:47) most women is that they don't that's a problem
(6:03:53) it's a problem problem do you guys think that women are obligated to reproduce sorry
(6:04:00) most women well it's not it's not obligated to reproduce but an obligation to move society towards reproduction i
(6:04:06) think they're obligated so i'm not saying this is a problem people get in their brains right they think when you say women have a social obligation to
(6:04:12) reproduce well some women can't reproduce it's like well yeah we know some women can't reproduce some men
(6:04:18) can't join the you know the military some men can't protect their own families because of disability we know that right the case is though where do
(6:04:25) we want to move as a society we want to move towards a reproductive society so we want the society to glorify the
(6:04:32) mother and the family and everything else should just be noise boss babes
(6:04:37) should not be glorified workingass women there's no reason to glorify that what
(6:04:43) is to glorify there yeah i don't want the best and brightest women slaving away in a [ __ ] cubicle i want them at
(6:04:49) home raising the next generation of the best and brightest kids yeah not outsourcing it to [ __ ] consuela
(6:04:54) that's stupid question would you take care of your daughter until she found a husband would you so she didn't have to
(6:05:01) work but she's looking for a husband full-time yeah i think that not only is that the uh was was the standard in
(6:05:09) society but look at kids now you know zoomers in even millennials were living
(6:05:14) at home longer and longer and longer and longer and longer until you know 23 24
(6:05:19) 25 women this is often the case and by the way when men men move out they'll go
(6:05:25) get like a studio apartment right and then litter it with beer cans and and rappers they don't give a [ __ ] right
(6:05:31) women don't do that they have female roommates they go out and move out with female roommates they mostly aren't even
(6:05:37) living alone that young right so it's always seems to be that they're under the domain of protection of men no
(6:05:42) matter what and so yeah if uh if women though i don't think it's a good idea to
(6:05:48) prioritize them going to school for an elongated period of time that they should prioritize uh dating the right
(6:05:54) people getting into the correct social groups so that they can find and categorize husband and family first and
(6:06:01) the fact that that's even controversial to me is [ __ ] crazy i just like it's it's so obvious no all right nope sorry
(6:06:08) got to move it on uh the frank castle thank you frank castle donated $30 andrew can't put down
(6:06:16) the duncan made me cry out laughing today good work with those idiots he's referencing andrew was on piers morgan

(6:08:48) donated $30 chair one is definitely on drugs andrew i was surprised you took it
(6:08:55) pretty easy on the trans dude even after he called you stupid you definitely had
(6:09:00) a lot of ammo and were justified to do so he just tuned out but he probably still
(6:09:05) heard it because he's probably still tuned uh hearing some of the stream or something wait which one what it was on
(6:09:12) pierce morgan oh yeah yeah no none of us
(6:09:17) like no no no no he was arguing with someone that was trans and yeah there
(6:09:23) were some comments guys if you want $30 tts if you want to get a roast in uh we have some notes we need to get through
(6:09:28) and a couple things luckily there's not too much here from the questionnaire uh but i do let's see why don't we just do
(6:09:34) uh why don't we just do a bit of notes before we do the questionnaire uh natalie you you describe yourself as a
(6:09:41) high-value woman who's only going to date a high-v value man men have only treated me with the utmost respect and
(6:09:47) decency uh what is a highv value woman um i think that's somebody that holds
(6:09:53) their um i mean i i don't know that's a good
(6:09:59) question i think it's somebody that holds their beliefs um and upholds them so what they believe in um for me that's
(6:10:06) my faith and so i'm going to try to honor god in all that i do and say and
(6:10:12) act and i try to do that to the best of my ability and um so i hope to find that
(6:10:17) in a guy and i would say that that's the same for a high value man i would want him to honor god and all that he says and all that he does as well okay you
(6:10:25) said that being overly nice doesn't make you lovable it makes you disposable do you mean like as a woman being overly
(6:10:31) nice i think that i i kind of mean that in a sense of if a guy's like "hey um
(6:10:40) love to take you on a date will you drive to me?" and being like "yep i'll hop in the car right there and i'll drive to you right away." and it's like
(6:10:46) a lack of allowing the guy to pursue you you're being almost like overly nice wait if you drive to his place no or to
(6:10:54) the date or whatever let's say that let's say like your guy's like wanting to take you out on a first date sure um
(6:11:00) i would i would want for him to come and pick me up and do like the traditional
(6:11:05) date right and show the effort there but if he's you know just sitting at his house and and is texting me late at
(6:11:12) night and wanting me to come over and i'm overly nice and i just want to come over and see him and i think that that
(6:11:17) makes you not a high value woman for a first date or yeah like if he's like
(6:11:23) "hey come over to my place let's hang out." want that i mean you're you you said you've
(6:11:29) hold on you said you were a virgin right i mean you're not going over to that's what i'm saying though house at 11 i'm
(6:11:35) saying that that's just like a small like a small scenario but what about if he wants to meet you at 6 he wants to
(6:11:40) meet you at 7:00 p.m at a restaurant to take you out to a nice dinner i will be there no but he says meet me there
(6:11:47) that's okay oh that's okay yeah okay so it's okay i see that's totally okay i would totally make the effort okay um
(6:11:55) you said unjabbed or nothing okay i don't know if we can really get into that on youtube too much but uh okay
(6:12:02) cool um so if they got is this just the co or is
(6:12:08) it all vaxes no that was just co just co okay after everything that's come out [ __ ] it up with the measles or some [ __ ]
(6:12:14) i don't know um uh you said you love gender roles men should lead but they have to be worthy
(6:12:19) leaders you said you're saving intimacy for marriage doesn't make you prude means you uh here we'll do why don't we
(6:12:26) do splits on these oops my bad hold on uh you said that does make you approve
(6:12:32) it means you value your body your future spouse too much to give away pieces of yourself to people who aren't committed
(6:12:38) to you you said feminine energy is powerful you believe women were designed with strength that compliments men not
() 
(6:12:43) compete with them uh you said you'll never date for fun or out of boredom if i can't see a future with someone
(6:12:50) uh or well why would you waste their time or mine intentional dating isn't
(6:12:56) boring it's just focused on the bigger picture in the hearts of men i'm engaging with you said feminism lied to
(6:13:01) you they told us we could have it all but at what cost working 70our weeks being strong and independent and putting
(6:13:07) off family until it's too late doesn't sound empowering it sounds miserable modesty is hotter than you think anyone
(6:13:13) can show skin but covering up is a real flex it says i know my worth and i don't
(6:13:18) or it says well yeah it's these are this is what you're saying not me uh it says i know my worth i don't need attention
(6:13:23) to prove it there's something wildly attractive about leaving a little mystery if he's not leading you to god he's leading you nowhere a man who
(6:13:31) doesn't prioritize his faith can't leave a family so what do you think about that she says uh modesty is
(6:13:38) hotter than dressing like a trumpet she didn't say that but that's my artistic
(6:13:44) adapt adaptation uh anyone can show us your thoughts i would just say uh love
(6:13:50) that for her love that for her and that's it yeah
(6:13:56) love that for her love that you think that way cool question i have a question for you
(6:14:01) if a guy if a guy who you're dating was like
(6:14:07) "i don't like your nose piercings." i would take him out if i was truly wanting to yeah all right yeah all right
(6:14:13) no argument first date though how about that no cupid i'd be like he he hasn't shown me enough that we're going to talk
(6:14:19) to okay so no on the okay fair all right we got notes from mad line recently single uh wait six months i get
(6:14:26) well i guess rebound was there a rebound no rebounds okay there's no guys in the picture right now no no like utah fat
(6:14:35) boys or no they play they play lacrosse or football guy i don't know they play lacrosse in utah um you said a man
(6:14:41) without purpose structure and a track record of success isn't ready for a good woman talking means nothing results do
(6:14:49) i did say that you you should put that on your uh real estate pitch um a man's
(6:14:55) role is to protect and lead a woman's role is to enrich and facilitate oo
(6:15:00) enrich yep and facilitate uh careers matter but love and service to family
(6:15:06) matter more okay you tracked what you are so level up before expecting it in
(6:15:11) someone else soft you said soft femininity thrives with a disciplined selfless man what is soft femininity i
(6:15:19) just think it's the ability to let go i think it's what a lot of women need in this generation is just an actually
(6:15:25) conservative disciplined man who can show like i can take the reigns i can handle all this responsibility and i am
(6:15:32) strong enough mature enough and disciplined enough to take that on and i just don't feel like women see that all the time and we would love to see it
(6:15:38) more you need a man to be your brain for you i get it totally that's real wait
(6:15:45) say that again it's real no it's real like when you walk into the airport i don't even want have to think about where i'm going like i would love for
(6:15:52) him to yeah take the lead on that going here okay uh sweet uh let's see you said
(6:15:58) the government lies the bible holds the truth okay all right dating sucks
(6:16:03) because women don't respect themselves men take the easy option but want the hardest what do you mean by the hard i
() 
(6:16:11) think it's exactly what you said about um the attractiveness level of like you
(6:16:16) know some guy is willing to sleep with a girl under his leak but wants the hottest girl at the bar it's like men
(6:16:22) will always take the easy option and so the way to fix dating culture as a whole is for just women to uphold higher
(6:16:27) standards and just be a little bit harder i see i think if you if you up if
(6:16:33) you just up even a few um variables it increases the average by a lot and so
(6:16:38) it's like even if some of the general population is the reason why dating is as bad as it is is because of modern
(6:16:44) culture and how people act now if everything andrew talked about wanted to happen that's what would need to happen
(6:16:49) first you yeah you said uh fixing this generation starts with women having standards men will rise to meet them y
(6:16:57) women having standards i feel like i don't know the the
(6:17:02) standards are kind of pretty high from women they're pretty up there if you want a traditional woman that woman
(6:17:07) needs to uphold traditional standards you can't just that yeah sure but are
(6:17:13) they across the board are women tried um no oh okay i mean even you seem to have
(6:17:19) a bit of push back on this career thing yeah i do is that trad no but i'm i'm
(6:17:24) not fully tad oh okay i i wouldn't say that yeah i mean i think that's fair i think people aren't it's not like black
(6:17:31) or white on or off if a guy knew he could text a girl on snapchat at 10 p.m
(6:17:37) and say "what are you doing?" and she didn't respond or give that the time of day ever people wouldn't do it but
(6:17:43) because it happens and because girls are down for that then that be brings the casuality into these relationships that
(6:17:49) ultimately makes dating suck it's a true it's yeah it's true i agree i agree 100%
(6:17:55) i mean i think the probably maybe the ultimate standard that some or most of the women here would maybe want to see
(6:18:02) is that if all women's uh i don't know if it's would be a
(6:18:08) boundary or whatever but if all women's position was no sex till marriage probably like increase the
(6:18:15) marriage rate a little bit men would be dating more int oh look at this it's the
(6:18:21) three-way good job is this the first time the three cam hey guys we got a new camera i i or not
(6:18:27) a new camera a new scene kind of cool uh can you guys hear us okay did anything
(6:18:32) in the audio change when we did guys it's every angle it's beautiful hey good job you're a legend um yeah i think uh i
(6:18:41) don't know if if it was just okay if you men want sex they have to get married that would change a lot
(6:18:48) you don't think the divorce rate would be high though too women that save themselves for marriage actually their divorce rates are much
(6:18:54) lower and i can show you the statistics if you would like it is true dang do you have statistics for like literally
(6:19:00) everything autism what can i say nice uh okay nice
(6:19:06) guys you said nice guys don't finish last weak men do no girl actually
(6:19:11) doesn't want a nice guy every girl in this on this table i can guarantee wants a nice guy do they yes yes we want a man
(6:19:18) that's powerful but nice we want a man that could be kind i wouldn't say nice yeah kind but at the end of the day it all
(6:19:25) means the same thing i don't want some random guy that's going to pull over and let a bunch of homeless people into my car because he's so nice and you don't want a weak man but that's different
(6:19:32) than just being kind or nice and i should have used a different word but the meaning is still there yeah i think a lot of women
(6:19:38) though like if you get a girl flowers on a first date i'm not saying all women are going to be uh find that give them
(6:19:46) the ick but there's definitely women out there who like he's doing too much i would go for where some girls are like and i'm
(6:19:53) like why are you making fun of a man for trying like why are you making fun of a man for trying yeah that's like a
(6:19:58) possibility yeah like that's so sweet like you had intention you went you bought them out before you seen me i
(6:20:04) think it's because dating has become like this casual thing with like no purpose or intention behind it people just like "oh go on a chill date." like
(6:20:10) "oh my gosh you got me flowers." it's not that serious free dates are the best for the top three dates like just do free dates or under $10 for like ice
(6:20:16) cream or something no like but i think getting flowers is like a great thing and i think it all stems from the fact
(6:20:21) that dating is is done without a purpose now and if you're not dating until dating if you're not dating for marriage
(6:20:28) you're dating for heartbreak and that's the problem is people are just casually dating just for funsies and then they
(6:20:34) get shocked when someone actually cares about them and brings flowers to the first date like oh my gosh a guy that
(6:20:40) actually cares about me and is serious about being with me this is thoughtful terrible yeah it's amazing i would go
(6:20:45) dumpster diving on a first date and that would stoke me honestly i'm so easy to please nice um okay we have let's see
(6:20:52) here uh okay if you feel lost you're distracted and lack purpose from god for
(6:20:58) your life that's what you said feminism is lying to you about what will actually bring joy you're a boss babe i know that
(6:21:05) my family is going to bring me more contentment than all of that will doesn't mean nothing else can fair enough uh please you said you won't date
(6:21:13) someone with ser you won't date someone with serious mental health issues if i work for a strong mind i deserve the
(6:21:19) same i agree with you fully on this i've actually caught flack because i think i said i've caught flack for two things uh
(6:21:26) i caught flack for i said i wouldn't date somebody who's bipolar this was a long time ago
(6:21:32) got a bunch of flack for it and then i also wouldn't date an ex uh drug addict
(6:21:38) mhm like somebody who used to be has too many highs and lows well they could be clean for a couple years but i just it
(6:21:44) would be a preference a very strong preference not saying it's like i i
(6:21:49) wouldn't say it's a if the person's fantastic right m it's not 100% a deal breaker but like i'm leaning very
(6:21:56) strongly like this is a sub optimal uh situation to be dating somebody who used
(6:22:01) to be addicted to heroin oh yeah i think people can be redeemed and they can stay clean and sober for their entire lives
(6:22:08) but like if it's a choice between somebody who used to be addicted to heroin and somebody who never did heroin
(6:22:14) i think like all things being equal i'm picking the soberest soberest why not
(6:22:19) the bipolar that doesn't do it why not bipolar yeah it's a lot to keep up with uh i'm just very minimally bipolar and
(6:22:27) stuff and i feel like sure like i'm pretty chill and i mean look i think you have to look at the entire package um
(6:22:35) you have to look at the totality of uh who somebody is but generally speaking i
(6:22:40) think both men and women we're trying to get the best that we can get we're trying to get the most optimum partner
(6:22:46) we can get and if we're just being realistic there are certain things that tend to like person could be great and
(6:22:52) attractive and all these things but then there could be like xyz bullet points where it's like ooh okay not ideal not
(6:22:59) ideal not ideal i think uh mental illness and specific mental illnesses
(6:23:05) tend to be like not ideal would you not date someone with schizophrenia
(6:23:10) probably not i mean i know there's different severities to it but that's a pretty severe yeah that's intense oh no
(6:23:17) i was just wondering because of family whatever i want to be hyping up with a schizophrenic or something um no no i'm
() 
(6:23:24) not no i don't think i just have a lot of beliefs on schizophrenia like if we treated it the same as transgenderism
(6:23:29) then um the world would be a terrible place because we would affirm their beliefs like following you there is a
(6:23:36) person following you you're right babe that's a good point that's a good point um no that is true and uh yeah but i got
(6:23:44) i got blown up some girl who used to be a drug addict made a tiktok about me oh
(6:23:49) what she was like "oh my god he wouldn't date or drape." the [ __ ] is that uh date
(6:23:56) yeah seriously i'm lightweight uh he wouldn't date somebody who used to do
(6:24:03) drugs i'm like is that i don't feel i don't feel like that that's crazy like a crazy standard i don't think so i think
(6:24:09) that like it also too it's like the worry in a sense if it's especially if it's like something like heroin like
(6:24:14) chances are if they started using again they might like you might come home and they could be passed away because like
(6:24:20) it you know when they do it when a long time ago they have a tolerance and then
(6:24:25) all of a sudden everything could be all peachy and then one thing and you're like oh my gosh what happened and it's
(6:24:30) so little but it it made a big thing because it's been so many years so i i agree and also the thing is is that you
(6:24:37) know look i used to have an addiction to what video games
(6:24:45) uh world of warcraft oh okay okay and the thing is right when it comes to
(6:24:50) addiction mhm if you're going through like a stressful period in your life you could be i i was clean from world of
(6:24:57) warcraft for a decade i was clean and then i had a stressful
(6:25:03) period and i i went back i relapsed i had a world of warcraft relapse uh and
(6:25:11) that [ __ ] was crazy son it was crazy look anyways um random did it feel good when
(6:25:18) you played again oh my god it felt so good it was an escape it was an escape from my problems it was like i was
(6:25:25) shooting up the world of warcraft it was so good random question you think men should avoid pornography of warcraft
(6:25:33) yeah but like but but so just because somebody's been clean doesn't mean they're going to stay clean true yeah
(6:25:39) what was your what was your thing um so you think men should stay away from corn and stuff because it's addictive sure
(6:25:44) okay i don't i actually i i saw some study that it's that's kind of bogus but
(6:25:50) uh regardless of whether it's addictive or not i don't think men watching porn is good no i think there's like
(6:25:57) consumption where it's like okay he watches it like once a month i think that's less worrying than a guy who's
(6:26:02) like a cummer who's watching it like every single day for hours uh but ultimately i think uh no porn or as
(6:26:09) minimal as possible is probably ideal and like in a relationship definitely
(6:26:14) yeah no not watching porn you should save save that for your girlfriend or wife or whatever so is that was there a
(6:26:21) follow-up on that or no i was just wondering because you were talking about addiction and stuff and i know that's a big one men this day and age tend to
(6:26:27) have okay uh i mean i again i would dispute that it's an actual addiction
(6:26:33) but i think uh let me ask the women here would you guys do the following trade so
(6:26:39) i know a lot of women have an issue with men who watch uh adult content
() 
(6:26:46) would you guys give up social media and instagram if men gave up porn yes yes
(6:26:53) yes for like like in a relationship or just if you're not in a relationship you just give it away
(6:26:59) uh let's just say in a relationship in a relationship i would say yes however um they need to get out these certain
(6:27:05) philosophies that i have that i'm like scheduled to get out and as long as they can get them out then cool but i just
(6:27:11) can't have these philosophies buried what the [ __ ] there's just certain
(6:27:17) things that i need to say and i need someone either to say it for me or i need to say it i love that for you go
(6:27:24) off um yeah no i mean i think the c the impact of social media on on women is
(6:27:32) commensurate to the impact of porn on men in fact i think it's wor i think social media for women is worse
(6:27:38) absolutely it can be i do social media for a job and i still agree with you well i think
(6:27:45) i think social media has been bad for everybody but i think there's a differential
(6:27:51) impact on women females compare i think to like a lot and yeah reading a book i
(6:27:58) recommend everyone should read it um the anxious generation and it talked about how social media is far more detrimental
(6:28:05) to women's mental health than it is to men's for many reasons yeah get off
(6:28:10) social media if you're a woman i did it like a year ago and so much happier yeah
(6:28:16) and i think there's i mean it's there's differences but the impact on a relationship is definitely different
(6:28:22) just because i think some women get male validation through the social media
(6:28:30) which uh isn't really so much a factor for most men most men aren't going to
(6:28:35) social media to get validation from women and most men can't get it but yeah uh let's see here we have i'm trying to
(6:28:42) see if there's anything else uh you said but wait hold on you said a bunch of
(6:28:47) dope legendarybased [ __ ] mattaline is it you prefer maddie or maline what about m
(6:28:54) dog m dog m dog all right m dog you said a trad wife isn't the only path to
(6:29:00) fulfilling family focused life so when you say tradife are you saying career
(6:29:06) boss babe or what do you mean when i'm saying like being a tra wife is the only way you're saying a trad wife isn't the
(6:29:12) only path to a fulfilling family focused life so you're saying like a balance
(6:29:18) between career and family is that yes it's possible for sure i i guess it's possible that's what i plan on doing i
(6:29:25) don't plan on quitting my full-time job working for what if your husband wait what's his name he's been through this all i don't know if it's private but his
(6:29:31) name's ethan ethan does he do social media or is he more private he hates that i'm a public figure he like three

(6:31:09) here abby g married at 19 you said to answer the last question you have
(6:31:14) experience with two long-term relationships one where you were masculine and egotistical and your boyfriend was emotional oh i think we
(6:31:21) these are your old notes right we already covered it in your previous show then um okay uh you said
(6:31:27) i think i don't know if you provide anything new well i don't even have instagram i'm going to be honest with you brian so if anyone's ever if
(6:31:35) anyone's ever talk to me on instagram or anything else you're actually talking to my husband just so you know cuz he
(6:31:42) manages it he has actually yeah i don't have my instagram but he does that's
(6:31:48) kind of based so he'll like send me screenshots and be like "what should i say to this?" or he'll just respond but
(6:31:54) i don't have it post stuff on behalf of you um his posts on my story and that's
(6:32:00) it wait what your husband's like your social media manager so funny he he even
(6:32:07) does like when she does a post he'll put put the like the the nail the sparkling nail emoji or whatever i don't know
(6:32:15) what's that emoji the the nail polish emoji yeah he he does that too it's so
(6:32:20) funny he's funny uh okay ryder you said in your instagram it says you're divinely protected what does that mean
(6:32:26) um uh oh it's just meaning like i'm protected like that's it by the divine no just divinely like nice yeah like
() 
(6:32:35) through through god through christ whatever you want to believe tik tok we watch but with every with anything you
(6:32:41) weren't really divinely protected though on which tik tok talk that that tik tok with the like and then he like hooked up
(6:32:47) with a dude like oh yeah yeah where was the
(6:32:53) divine protection i mean obviously there was none right there but um that was also me just being
(6:33:00) a the divine protection was with the what is that word i was just being oblivious and like i just should have
(6:33:06) known yeah cuz then i definitely would not have spent that much time i love it okay you said you got married at 19 for
(6:33:12) fafsa is that student loans oh yeah wait
(6:33:17) that makes sense cuz i remember when i got married i was like oh yes yeah yeah yeah cuz the only the biggest reason cuz
(6:33:23) uh i mean number one we were together for a while anyways but uh he was the one that was kind of like we should get
(6:33:29) married we should get married especially because uh he didn't have parents like they both died when he was a young like
(6:33:34) a young age so he was like basically kind of like i want to do this for you because this is the only way i know you
(6:33:40) could definitely go through school with me and i was like okay i was like i love you so much we're going to get married
(6:33:46) anyway might as well do it now and yeah did he have like some sort of father figure
(6:33:51) growing up oh no no um his mom died from like this crazy cancer when he was like
(6:33:56) six and then his dad died right after from like alcoholism and stuff oh wow so yeah yeah he was a foster kid so when we
(6:34:04) met in high school and everything i was like i was already i was already in the trenches with you i got the man so
(6:34:11) put it back um okay uh you said marriage isn't the main end goal you said women
(6:34:18) are more sexually advanced and addicted what do you mean by this okay wait i did
(6:34:23) i didn't think i said marriage while we still have mary can you pull up the meme that meme the men's romance versus
(6:34:30) women's romance is this what you're talking about i'm going to pull this up let's see uh women's romance i'm going
(6:34:37) to kill you harder daddy going to love and take care of you all
(6:34:44) is that yeah i just okay so like um actually in college like when i took a seminar and everything for it it was
(6:34:50) just like basically talking about like how like when you go through trauma um some people express it sexually and
(6:34:57) obviously women go through a little bit different trauma yeah but like they go through more trauma you know like
(6:35:03) obviously with like sex being sexualized and stuff like that so it's historical
(6:35:08) too yeah like the whole thing about the about the statues with the women and
(6:35:15) that one of their boobs are always like a different color because it's just those weird men that want to take a picture and think it's funny but it's
(6:35:21) like it's it's a statue yeah but yeah yeah but that's what i meant by that but
(6:35:27) going back onto like how lydia said earlier yeah a lot of people are not there's different colored boobs okay i
(6:35:34) know what she's talking i know what she's talking about so like there's different size actually
(6:35:40) because like the they're they're touching them and it's like rubbing off
(6:35:45) the color on statues women yeah why are we talking about statues wait what i
(6:35:51) don't know why she brought it up well cuz you said about women being like cuz we were talking about being sexualized for so long even like any type of women
(6:35:58) is going to be sexualized but what about explain the statue thing because it's not even a real man it's not even a real
(6:36:03) woman and a man there's literally i know exactly what you're talking about where the statue's like uh worn down or
(6:36:09) whatever and and the color is different it's the same thing with a bulge on statues women do that it's literally the
(6:36:15) same i could find yeah i've seen photos i mean but let's be like i would i i
(6:36:21) would touch the boobs you would grab some boobs too she grabbed like i feel like that's kind of like you just go by
(6:36:27) and you're like i don't know i like honest confession yeah no i think it's
(6:36:33) cuz like i like like art so like okay like i wouldn't go and touch all of his stuff right now because i don't know
(6:36:39) what he paid for that i don't know how much he enjoys those yeah so i just feel like every statue you should respect
(6:36:45) just in general it's a landmark i i get that i i think i think my point of view is just like it's it's just in public i
(6:36:53) don't know just okay statues i love statues they're great favorite thing to
(6:36:58) see in public statues anyways uh oh uh i had lydia's notes here but we'll come to
(6:37:03) those when she's back from the bathroom oh she's scampering she's scampering back to the table here i have something

(6:42:51) to people r8 panda donated $30 chair not sure what you are looking at to your
(6:42:57) lower right but chill difference between cute and pretty is chair eight and two i
(6:43:03) challenge chair seven to find some to debate andrew on joseph smith oh wait
(6:43:09) difference between cute and pretty is when she was talking about what's the difference between cute and yeah cuz i
(6:43:15) was saying earlier that men say that they say lauren you're not a beautiful woman but you're a cute woman and i
(6:43:21) didn't know what that meant and but now here's the pickle you guys got to determine which one of you is the cute
(6:43:27) one and which one of you is the pretty one oh well yeah oh yeah well yeah what
(6:43:34) does he did he i think it's just like i' i've heard that too i think it's like just a difference in like like a vibe
(6:43:40) kind of a vibe like cute is more like oh fun playful whereas like beautiful is like more like
(6:43:46) she's the pretty maybe i feel like she's more handsome than pretty what does that
(6:43:52) mean pretty that's a compliment she looked good you're a handsome woman and you are heard that before you're very
(6:43:59) handsome you're the most handsome woman i i do not accept thank you she's she's

(6:45:01) we have selena gornz selena gour donated $30 j7 rated herself 3.7 and maybe
(6:45:08) that's true but her self-awareness and personality will make up for that in the long run stick to your fitness and look
(6:45:15) into al treatments for bipolar disorder i'm handling it pretty well and um i'm
(6:45:21) going to get rediagnosed because it was kind of like a doctor suggestion not an official diagnosis i think that
(6:45:26) rediagnosises should happen every like 5 years too like cuz i i don't know who's right and who's wrong i mentioned i'm
(6:45:32) mentally ill but people don't understand i wasn't diagnosed with autism until i was 18 and bipolar until i was 21 so
(6:45:38) i've been hiding it pretty well and it also depends on who was in your life at that point if someone was suck like bleeding you dry and they were that one
(6:45:44) guy yeah and and then there was maybe a lot of people you it also depends on who's diagnosing you yeah of course
(6:45:50) daniel mccoy donated $30 for those who support ab are you vegan if so is it
(6:45:58) okay to terminate a cow's pregnancy so i can eat the bovine fetus it's just a
(6:46:03) clump of cells right abby stay based abby oh abby yeah anybody can i add
(6:46:11) something sure first of all i'm completely against factory farming i think it's completely cruel and i think killing a animal and the fetus just to
(6:46:17) eat it is wrong and stuff but i do understand that there is a difference between humans and um animals and stuff
(6:46:25) i'm i am an animal activist even though i don't like pit bulls so i'm going to get crashed for that um but uh i think
(6:46:32) they deserve the best life possible monkeys what do i think about what monkeys or primates i think animals
(6:46:39) should not be tested on for any um treatments other than medical no but what do you think about them as as
(6:46:46) people or not they don't have the reason why humans are more valuable obviously from a religious perspective is because
(6:46:52) we are made in the image of god but also it's agency they have instincts we have
(6:46:59) animals animals only act on instinct whereas we have the ability to act based on morality and act above our instinct
(6:47:06) and make complex decisions and have a sense of creativity that animals don't have for real though i don't know chad
(6:47:14) with monkeys there's something about monkeys that bother me really what kind
(6:47:19) of monkeys kind of like us all monkeys bother me for some reason really well
(6:47:24) cuz have you ever seen these they're kind of bullies have you ever seen these videos where they'll like and one they're dangerous
(6:47:31) some of them a lot of them but they'll like these tourist areas they'll like steal your [ __ ]
(6:47:38) they'll steal your [ __ ] the chimps will kill you really aggressive they'll play with you too
(6:47:44) some of these some of these monkeys are well tigers and even some of the small ones their teeth they'll rip you up we
(6:47:51) the baby monkeys have really sharp teeth not too like mona monkeys mona monkeys there's certain monkeys that like
(6:47:56) they're they're still small but their teeth are and they got they'll rip your flesh i like the orange ones the baby
(6:48:03) orange ones cuz there's this thing called feast of the monkeys in thailand and that's like on my bucket list and and it's every year and all these
(6:48:10) monkeys eat all this food that's just put out by the town's people and they're just raiding it and it's just they're
(6:48:15) everywhere and there's babies and do it thailand's the best i went there yeah yeah they do steal stuff though the thie
(6:48:21) the thievery is from the monkeys yeah they're just so smart it's almost intimidating and steal them as pets and
(6:48:28) i think that's stupid oh yeah no there's warning signs whenever i go to like thailand or china there's like warning signs inside of the buildings like keep
(6:48:35) the windows closed cuz they're going to come in and steal your stuff and the big ones will attack people we got a message

(6:49:20) that was it i thought you set it up like this on purpose uh no not really it was just kind of happen stance that happened
(6:49:25) to be but it's good to have like a this is a little different than our normal show just cuz it leans more conservative

(6:52:28) extreme in either direction it was a good panel it was a good panel uh okay let's finish up these notes here uh
(6:52:36) lauren your one note is i think maybe you saw one of my tweets you said "what
(6:52:41) if the woman was nice her lifetime but never got was considered pretty?" is this in response to my lip filler tweet
(6:52:46) it so you i think you said something about like lip filler or plastic surgery and i um i just i think i said "oh it's
(6:52:55) if let's say the woman was just not considered pretty by like men and she
(6:53:02) just kept like it kept failing like she kept getting rejected or it just wasn't working." so she was like "you know what
(6:53:08) i'm just going to give plastic surgery a whirl to see if it changes my fate." and it did and the people responded to her
(6:53:15) like i remember the first day i got lip filler and the first day i got plastic surgery men were like all of a sudden giving me their phone numbers and like
(6:53:21) all of a sudden like holding doors open for me and i'm like dang like this is really weird and and i remember i
(6:53:27) remember i got plastic surgery again it was like a couple weeks later and i was only like 19 at that time but i started
(6:53:35) early and i remember when i got it and then this guy like hit on me like a this
(6:53:40) some random guy like another one i was like damn um and i said to myself in the car when i got back in i had like my
(6:53:46) starbucks or whatever i was like "damn that's cold." i was like "it's cold." because if i if i went in there like 3
(6:53:52) weeks ago he wouldn't even notice me but because i did this i was like "dang like that's hard." like you know and so so
(6:53:59) you know i did it for several years and i tried to make everything look pretty natural um there was a time i did go
(6:54:06) overboard though and i look like an entirely different like nationality um so i i had to actually get some stuff
(6:54:12) removed for sure like you're doing women who try to be natural a disservice by giving like an unrealistic standard um
(6:54:18) so i i just i just feel like i i refuse to suffer like i just i i'm over that
(6:54:24) period of my life and i hope that you know those women could be like "oh like i understand like why does she keep
(6:54:30) having to struggle like if she's just trying to look like just fit in like you
(6:54:36) know i don't i don't see anything wrong with it." but i think i think that plastic surgery if somebody wants to get it it's cool um but obviously there's
(6:54:44) we've all seen like you know they have like x boobs and you know and and and
(6:54:49) you wonder like oh can they travel on an airplane is that safe um but uh yeah
(6:54:55) well yeah you know they can explode if you yeah too big and i but yeah i mean i
(6:55:01) just always wondered that like i was like dang like what if the girl just wasn't considered attractive like what do you is she supposed to just die i was
(6:55:06) like she supposed to die out yes no but look i mean uh but for i guess for
(6:55:12) whatever for what other reason would women get plastic surgery but not to
(6:55:18) improve their physical appearance so that's i mean you don't get plastic surgery to look worse so well there are
(6:55:24) some plastic surgeries that are kind of done for health benefits i haven't had a plastic surgery but there is one we're
(6:55:30) talking about cosmetic like i think the context of the conversation would indicate like the i'm not talking about
(6:55:35) like you know you've got some war injury and you need your face reconstructed
(6:55:40) plastic surgery i'm talking about like you know lip fillers tit boob implants bbl for me it was so what happened was
(6:55:48) is i think that i like overworked when i was young and like i've totally like
(6:55:53) this will be like in my little novel i'm writing whatever but um i think i overworked and what happens is is you
(6:56:00) start to lose like the collagen in your face and i literally my i work at a i worked at aig for 5 years but before i
(6:56:08) worked at mcdonald's for 5 years and i remember my customers would really like me and they knew me since high school
(6:56:13) and i remember one who was a manager at aig came through the drive-thru and she was the one that discovered me and gave
(6:56:19) me my job there she came through and she was like "oh my gosh." she was like "what's wrong?" and i said "i'm working three jobs and i'm tired." and she said
() 
(6:56:25) "honestly i thought you were an old woman like i'm" and she said "i'm being really i'm not being mean." she says "you need to get out of here you need to
(6:56:32) get out of three jobs i'm going to get you like one solid job and you're going
(6:56:37) to be okay." sure enough i got out of there she got me a job and i took off after that and then i got my plastic
(6:56:43) surgery and then my life changed mhm okay so plastic surgery you got more
(6:56:50) attention from the men i i i'm not going to actually even dispute that i'm sure that women uh me personally i mean
(6:56:56) aesthetically i don't find plastic surgery attractive women uh if she has a small upper lip prefer that over the lip
(6:57:02) filler like the lip filler lip it just looks weird uh she could have small boobs i'd prefer that over like perfect
(6:57:09) fake titties she could have no butt or a small butt i'd prefer that over a perfect bbl she could have like a little
(6:57:15) belly fat i'd prefer that over the lipo belly um i think there's some uncanny valley when it comes to the plastic
(6:57:21) surgery it doesn't quite look right i also think it uh i would hope that women
(6:57:26) were we were pushing instead of going through these expensive and often dangerous surgical procedures we pushed
(6:57:34) women more towards accepting themselves as they are i think that could be men and men both men and women
(6:57:42) do but i personally just my own aesthetic taste yeah i don't find it i
(6:57:47) don't think it looks good and then i also think on top of that just aesthetically speaking i think it can also be tends to be proxy for uh some
(6:57:56) sort of mental illness so there's like some body dysmorphia like okay if you're you're so dissatisfied like let's say
(6:58:02) you have a a cup or a b cup you're so dissatisfied with that that and i understand it can be a point of
(6:58:07) insecurity for some women um and they feel like they might be more attractive to men if they had larger breasts but if
(6:58:14) it's like okay i'm going to spend thousands of dollars and then uh go
(6:58:19) under anesthesia which carries a risk of death with it so my breast so i can put
(6:58:24) plastic into my chest i think that that's like an indicator towards body
(6:58:30) dysmorphia and vanity and like me personally i think most men a lot of this stuff i feel like women do some of
(6:58:37) that stuff one yes for men but i almost think it's more so especially the lip
(6:58:42) filler i think it's more so for women because i've spoken to a lot of men most
(6:58:48) men and this is this was the tweet i wrote i don't think lip filler looks good like i genuinely like big lips are
(6:58:56) nice and attractive but not the lip filler lips i think it was my teeth were so big they were i actually had braces
(6:59:03) twice and i had braces for 11 years and um i also had got had to get the once they came off everybody hated my smile
(6:59:09) and they're like "uh better not smile like i don't like it it looks creepy." and so i ended up replacing i took from my retirement and i replaced the entire
(6:59:16) top row of my teeth instead of getting a boob job and and then everyone's like "wow you have such a beautiful smile."
(6:59:21) and i was like "wow i'm finally complimented jesus like took forever." yeah sure sure i don't dispute the fact
(6:59:27) that women who maybe got minimal or no attention from men they get fake tits
(6:59:34) they get their face done they get the lip filler maybe they change other things about them and then they start getting some more attention i'm sure
(6:59:40) that this happens i'm absolutely sure that this happens there's probably some cohort of men who do like the fake fake
(6:59:46) breasts i'm not disputing this me personally and i do think this is the case for the majority of men i think the
(6:59:52) majority of men uh don't want women with plastic surgery and in addition to the
(6:59:57) aesthetic components i just don't think that it tends to be an indicator perhaps
(7:00:03) it's doing us a favor in some ways if i see a girl with like crazy lip filler
(7:00:08) and she's got botox and she's got uh fake boobs that's a red flag like i'm
(7:00:14) not there's going to be a mismatch here in terms of in terms of values and um
(7:00:19) and there's there's going to be something maybe materialistic about her there's going to be a degree of vanity that i don't find attractive and so to
(7:00:27) me i just i don't like it i've asked a bunch of men if they like the lip fillers they don't like it i think the
(7:00:32) lip filler thing the the closest thing that i could think of and maybe the women can weigh in here
(7:00:38) you know those crazy steroid bodybuilders yeah i think they know a lot of women
(7:00:44) say and i think it's different than lip filler it's not a perfect onetoone comparison a lot of women say those
(7:00:50) insanely huge bodybuilders they're like i don't find that attractive it's like gross they do it for the gross to be
(7:00:57) like but they do it but they do it anyways and despite women's stated uh
(7:01:05) displeasure with these super steroided guys yeah and i genuinely think well one
(7:01:10) they're doing it for themselves and but they're kind of doing it for men yeah i
(7:01:15) i think if looking back so lip filler is like that like i think women there's actually a study on this
(7:01:22) recently that came up but we don't we can't pull it up but uh women i think get lip filler for other women because i
(7:01:28) think what's interesting is women's appraisal of what makes women or themselves beautiful is kind of
(7:01:35) different than men in the same way that men who are like aiming for this super super like massive musculature i do
(7:01:42) think women are attracted to fit strong muscular but not i don't think if you pull most
(7:01:47) of them it's not going to be like that hyper like giant arnold it's going to be more of like a
(7:01:55) very athletic uh build that i think they're going to find like the most attractive yeah i
(7:02:00) think looking back out of i think you know i kind of i actually do kind of
(7:02:06) agree in a sense where looking back i look at the plastic surgery i got i look at my situation you know everything and
(7:02:12) i just think you know it could just be i in summary my book is going to talk
(7:02:18) about i could have just been in the wrong place at the wrong time what's the title of your book going to be um the gentrification of me
(7:02:27) the gentrification of me so i i absorbed different things from different places um over my whole life and it became my
(7:02:34) personality and i was changed forever by by whatever uh the culture of uh there
(7:02:40) was a lot of iraqi influence where we were from and i learned a lot they helped me and i worked i was the only um
(7:02:47) latin native that worked with uh iraqi i i love the food and stuff and then there's also other um playboy like
(7:02:55) everything influenced me like mcdonald's aig all that but last thing sure last thing last thing yeah sorry um so i
(7:03:04) think that um i was at the wrong i i do in summation looking back on my life i
(7:03:10) do believe uh some people they aren't mentally ill they aren't ugly they aren't this they aren't that they're
(7:03:16) born in the wrong area and they need to get the hell out after three if if you're like 18 and you're having really
(7:03:21) bad experiences or just not so savory ones the majority of those years and then
(7:03:27) three more years go by it's time to get out of dodge and you need to go to a different place because perhaps like you
(7:03:34) said like men like like you like i i feel like from in my town it was very
(7:03:40) maybe there was more attractive women than me out there so you just didn't get hit on i didn't at all and and i but
(7:03:46) other women other i was the friend girl i was the guy's friend i was the guy's friend but then they would always tell
(7:03:52) me "oh your friend is so beautiful you're i" i was the ugly friend like to to them and so i i literally was just
(7:03:58) like i had yeah i know and i like i had can't believe it i had little things
(7:04:04) here and there but then once i once the i would say once like 18 hit or i would
(7:04:10) say 19 to 20 one that wasn't good years at all and so um or i would say even 18
(7:04:18) but um yeah it was just those were the toughest ones but once i got into playboy and everything changed cool but
(7:04:25) yeah i think i was in the wrong place i should have been somewhere else and maybe people would have found me attractive somewhere else and and i
(7:04:31) think you should have gone to uh you should have gone anywhere else you should have gone to kenya yeah i mean i
(7:04:36) could have i could have and then maybe men would have found me attractive you in kenya but you had to be born in
(7:04:43) oklahoma oh my god of course it didn't of course since you know what we should have packed your bags sent you to
(7:04:51) nigeria maybe maybe i would have felt like ethiopia somewhere they would have loved
(7:04:57) you in somalia yeah and and then but then like i these [ __ ] american men the [ __ ] i don't know i think it was
(7:05:05) just the grass was greener there probably was very be is there grass in his i don't know do they is there grass
(7:05:12) sahara do they know how to do landscaping whatever okay i got to move it on thank you thank no it's good it
(7:05:18) was good thank you lauren okay haley haley you said you've been through two rough relationships wait did we cover
(7:05:25) this last time no we didn't cover yeah we didn't cover any of my notes uh two rough relationships one that got
(7:05:30) physical involved weed and alcohol while the other one just the twist uh he used to twist scripture and using verses out
(7:05:37) of context as benefit proverbs 21:19 uh no that's my go-to i need to not lay
(7:05:44) down the law proverbs 21:19 better to live in a
(7:05:49) desert than with a quarrelome and nagging wife is that the only bible verse you have memorized uh i also know
(7:05:55) the one where it it i don't recall the name of it but it goes something like this it goes something like this
(7:06:03) children sons excuse me sons in a man's youth are like arrows in the hand of a
(7:06:09) warrior nice i actually don't know the wait how's the rest go rich is the man
() 
(7:06:15) whose quiver is full mhm or some [ __ ] yeah something like that that or some
(7:06:20) shit's also part of it i think i think it's there um which translation are you reading the atlas new kings atlas i
(7:06:29) don't know um all right uh but okay so he threw scripture in your face uh
(7:06:35) you're currently in the most healthy relationship you've ever been in you couldn't thank god more you guys met on christian dating app christian mingle uh
(7:06:42) no upward upward that one all right these girls are both on it um you said
(7:06:48) that uh you guys known each other for two years august together for two years uh in november he's in the air force
(7:06:55) he's 5 and a half years is he deployed or no he's not but he was deployed so he was in where's he stationed uh right now
(7:07:01) he's in fairfield uh travis air force so is it long distance um yes cuz i am
(7:07:06) going to school in fresno so it's like medium distance okay medium distance is funny medium distance relationship uh
(7:07:13) you wouldn't have expected when you were younger but he is your dream man he has all the qualities you have prayed for your whole life uh okay that's cool well
(7:07:20) you said men initiating you understand the reasoning why of why men don't initiate as much as they did back then
(7:07:25) but men don't even try at all anymore um yeah does this resonate with any of the females here men just they're not trying
(7:07:33) men not initiating i feel like before i started dating i was kind of just like waiting around for
(7:07:39) a man to even come up and like have a conversation with me about like you know
(7:07:45) if i was single or anything like that and i feel like that was never happening when i was single i don't know if you
(7:07:51) guys have had i feel like it's because of social media honestly that like guys can get what they want without having to
(7:07:58) go talk in person like snapchat i hate as someone who works in a youth ministry at my church i tell all my middle school
(7:08:03) girls delete snapchat it's bad news guys are just on there to get pictures from
(7:08:08) girls and i definitely know some guys that pursue like even my brother for example he goes and asks girls out and
(7:08:14) for sure so i wouldn't say that and i also think that girls too unfortunately
(7:08:20) um deny a lot of guys also because of social media so i think it kind of goes both ways unfortunately like abby said
(7:08:28) um you said majority of women are very hypocritical but them put themselves on a pedestal and think the world basically
(7:08:35) revolves around them modern dating is horrible women wanting all the things from men without even knowing what he
(7:08:40) would want in a perfect woman um yeah i think women um are very hypocritical i
(7:08:47) think that they uh try and stand on values because they know that those values will take them somewhere positive
(7:08:53) um but then they make decisions that are absolutely completely opposite of what
(7:08:59) they are advocating for so it's there's just a lot of hypocrisy um so it's very frustrating
(7:09:08) you guys have me using the term bars all the time bars
(7:09:13) blessed is the man wait the the sons of man wait a sons in a man's youth are
(7:09:19) like arrows in a warrior's hand blessed is he whose quiver is okay [ __ ] whatever
(7:09:25) i don't know i i forgot was the reference was the reference yeah it was the actual verse like was oh psalm 1274
(7:09:34) uh okay we have let's see with haley's thing i think uh you said oh you also
(7:09:39) think women have the most optionality when they stay virgins and as you get more bodies the less options you will
(7:09:45) have are you virgin or i'm not um but i do agree that i think that wait are you
(7:09:50) waiting till marriage though or no i am not oh okay yeah yeah he is your dream
(7:09:57) man he is he is my dream man yes if he can if he proposed if he proposed to to
(7:10:05) this day i yeah i i would give everything for that man so okay all
(7:10:10) right final notes here for caitlyn caitlyn final person anyways you said your first date ever was when you were
(7:10:16) 16 his ex showed up and cuddled with him yeah oh my god i'm a little traumatized
(7:10:22) his ex showed up and cuddled with him and he was so sweet but also tried to cuddle with you you left this was your
(7:10:28) first date ever it was my very first date that's traumatic it was so traumatic what the heck it was awful oh
(7:10:35) girl why did he do that um he didn't invite her her it was a double date so he in his friend invited her because he
(7:10:41) wanted to get the gang back together the gang what the heck are you sure this was a date it's a date no i told him very
(7:10:47) clearly "okay this is the first date it's a double date." um it's my very first date i'm so excited to meet with you and the guy just did not comprehend
(7:10:53) and thought i was going to scadaddle before it it was so weird i'm traumatized that does sound you said you
(7:10:59) believe women need to be submissive and men need to man up and be masculine abortion oh wait uh okay
(7:11:06) uh yeah abortion was even the thing to bring into modern society and for us to thrive it needs to be eradicated
(7:11:13) absolutely okay you said uh you disagree with brian on the artificial womb discussion and male promiscuity okay uh
(7:11:20) we we'll have to be quick on these but let's start with the male promiscuity one what's the disagreement um i believe
(7:11:26) you used to be kind of okay with male promiscuity i don't remember 100% i was watching some old episodes and i think
() 
(7:11:31) you used to be you're anti-marriage right you are from what i understand
(7:11:37) anti-marriage yeah well so i'll adjust the first thing so um i don't think i've ever i've pretty sure for the most part
(7:11:44) i've been uh against male promiscuity i might have gotten it mixed up with someone else but i think there's
(7:11:50) differences for uh i think there's differences so yeah but i agree i'm not in favor of
(7:11:57) male promiscuity but i do think it's uh there's a difference no i agree like
(7:12:04) it's any woman could be a [ __ ] not every man can be a [ __ ]
(7:12:10) so it's kind of like if the man is a [ __ ] takes a bit of skill it does takes a bit
(7:12:16) of skill for him to be skill to hide conceal those urges i think it's way more attractive if a guy is like "hey i
(7:12:23) have these urges but i held them back i have so much great control over myself yeah and then i guess the other
(7:12:28) component is there i think there's more of a perhaps a biological urge for
(7:12:34) promiscuity in men mhm i think society functions better monogously but i think from like a
(7:12:42) biological level just just due to reproduction like
(7:12:47) y'all can only get pregnant like a man can have sleep with 10 different women
(7:12:52) get them all pregnant per day mhm maybe not 10 i mean especially if he's in his 30s
(7:12:59) but a woman you got nine months that's it so there's like an evolutionary thing or biological definitely but i don't
(7:13:06) think it's good for society and uh yeah but let's switch to artificial oh well anti-marriage yes not not in favor of
(7:13:13) marriage you don't think i should be married uh no so i think for religious reasons it's actually a great just like
(7:13:20) that's the only reason i can think of to get married but i can't actually think if i'm open to hearing a compelling
(7:13:26) secular argument for why uh like a benefit in totality for why men should
(7:13:32) get married okay so in my church you get sealed in the temple and not only do you get did you miss the part about secular
(7:13:38) but go ahead okay sorry no go ahead what about your church you um get to be sealed in the temple and be with them
(7:13:43) for eternity so the benefit of doing a marriage past the law with um and um doing a temple marriage is you get to be
(7:13:50) with this person in heaven forever wait what happens in death do us part like i'll give you uh earthly like i'll be
(7:13:58) with you i can stand you for my earth life but once it's heaven i'm good i
(7:14:03) once we get to heaven you're going to try it was nice knowing you right cuz it was death till deathart yeah in heaven
(7:14:10) we're not going can i start playing like heaven not going to recognize our
(7:14:16) husbands madison wives maddie maline sorry i'm sorry madline maline is that french that's a french name i always
(7:14:22) french maline you french no
(7:14:28) okay um but you know you death do us part no there's no marriages in heaven i think you can't get married no there's
(7:14:34) no marriage in heaven sex in heaven no i i mean there's no sex are we just like barbie dolls there's nothing there
(7:14:41) we're just desires those are earthly desires earthly desires so is it like avatar in heaven desires of the flesh
(7:14:47) you know in avatar where it's like the the hairs connect no there's just no marriage anymore it's
(7:14:54) just like we wouldn't we won't care about that anymore we'll be too happy i always felt like is there surfing in
() 
(7:15:00) heaven can you snowboarding there's actually not snowboarding in utah i
(7:15:05) think i always you're more of a skier though i feel like you're a skier yeah it's kind of an l but i felt like
(7:15:13) snowboarding is just better sorry if um if let's say um let's say nobody found
(7:15:19) their soulmate i always had this weird like twilight zone theory that like here we go lauren tell us the story yeah okay
(7:15:25) so i always had this weird twilight zone theory if you can't find your soulmate in your life whoever the hell you're
(7:15:31) buried next to i'm not like saying like let's say you're buried alone the closest person to you that's going to be like your like soulmate like i i had
(7:15:37) this weird idea but that was just like you know an idea i believe god has everyone for someone and stuff but you
(7:15:44) know it doesn't have to happen in this life where's the scripture for that no
(7:15:49) there's no scripture i'm not doing a scriptural debate but i will bring my father on and we can bring up scripture mine was just for my head wait wasn't
(7:15:57) like okay i'm not going to linger on the mormon thing didn't y'all find a book
(7:16:02) like somewhere in yes it was the dead sea scrolls no the golden plates the
(7:16:07) golden plates they were golden in the forest and there were plates yeah they were paper plates no in golden um in
(7:16:15) golden just gold sheets oh like a a okay a tablet yeah and the one tablet
(7:16:22) official translator who wasn't joseph smith said "oh this is true." and then he realized what they were saying in the book and he's like "wait no it's not
(7:16:28) true take it back." are there aliens in mormonism no i thought there were like aliens there's an alien religion
(7:16:35) wait what where are the golden plates now they were removed by moroni there is an alien religion though and it there
(7:16:41) were it was um it was it was in elcohone and and they had a spaceship and people would worship it have you been abducted
(7:16:48) i don't know i think you wait have you been abducted i haven't been abducted have you been probed did they probe you
(7:16:53) i didn't get probed but i will say this will be in your book i have seen a yeah this will be in the book i had i had
(7:16:59) seen an i genuinely saw you that's crazy really when i got abducted by an alien
(7:17:05) when like he doesn't remember yeah it was like co time walking you
(7:17:12) know it's like social distancing or whatever did you float up in the in the light that like you know how they
(7:17:19) get beamed no i got beamed up dang yeah that was crazy wow yeah the aliens they
(7:17:26) spoke spanish for some reason i don't know why i was like whoa yeah it was weird it was really weird i
(7:17:33) don't speak spanish so i was like can like biblote i don't know anyways okay
(7:17:39) hold on let's get off the alien thing really quick yeah they taught me while they're probing me they were t telling
(7:17:45) me about the bibliotech elondagas in la bibliotech
(7:17:50) yes i don't know what that means but yes meatballs in the library so uh wait really quick anti-marriage uh yeah i
(7:17:57) can't actually you know what there's risks even to uh religious men i understand the traditional justification
(7:18:04) though for getting married because there's a uh religious comp there's a compelling i
(7:18:13) don't know what the [ __ ] it's like uh under religion that's like what you got kind of have to do you know commandment
(7:18:19) yeah i mean no honestly i don't think that there's a super compelling non-religious reason to get married
(7:18:25) except for i mean you are pro family kids right yes yeah but you can have you
(7:18:31) can like stay with somebody forever and be married and have kids with them but why would you not want a like actual
(7:18:37) commitment to them like a oh it is a commitment yeah but like there that's just don't you like why wouldn't you get
(7:18:45) married like why not i remember an episode that candace owens came on here
(7:18:50) oh and she was speaking facts about how it just doesn't make sense outside of
(7:18:56) the religious it really doesn't yeah at all like the only thing that makes sense is like when you get hurt and they're
(7:19:03) like "oh the only person that's like going to take care of you is your husband." cuz like they won't call your mom and dad they call your husband yeah
(7:19:10) like that's well i mean i mean your next next of kin which would be your parents can would have a medical authority in
(7:19:16) the case of what if you don't have parents anymore at god forbid whatever age well whoever your next of kin would be would then have uh they they would be
(7:19:24) able to make medical decisions for you but you could do a i think it's called a it's like a advanced healthcare
(7:19:31) directive so you can if i could have maline over there she could
(7:19:37) be my advanced healthcare directive and she could if i got into a coma i'd be a little scared you know she's like she's
(7:19:44) not going to she yeah she's not going to keep me on life support she's going to be like "fuck this guy dang it m he can
(7:19:50) you know i'll give him 3 hours of life support and then it's done for your be
(7:19:56) really nice." but uh i just i have even for religious men though because all the negatives that i could list to you which
(7:20:02) i won't just for the sake of time all the negatives when it comes to divorce these would equally apply to christian
(7:20:09) men so but for secular i just don't see what
(7:20:14) what the point is and then there's substantial risks even for christian men to get married or at least the i
(7:20:20) shouldn't say i mean it's the bread winner forever whoever the bread winner is uh but even
(7:20:27) what about a marriage not under the law but under the lord well i mean then you
(7:20:32) got to be careful certain states have common law marriage and then and then um
(7:20:38) prenups get challenged okay they get thrown out they could be the uh you know
(7:20:43) i signed this under duress blah blah blah it's they can be challenged they are challenged and uh look you know
(7:20:50) look just give me a compelling reason i can i can go i can tell you why i think
(7:20:56) marriage is bad tell me why marriage is good so you can be with your person forever and your family but hold on i
(7:21:02) can be with my i can stay with somebody i can meet somebody today uh and stay
(7:21:08) with them for the rest of my life but not if you're not with them in the temple you can be with them for the rest of your life but in heaven i'm waiting
(7:21:14) for not you can file jointly on taxes but that's great if you're a mormon what
(7:21:20) if you're non mormon there's no secular argument to get behind marriage
(7:21:27) marriage is a religious sacrament so for someone to get married when they're not religious there is there really is no
(7:21:34) point i mean you can have the same you can accomplish the same thing without marriage yeah you can still have a
(7:21:39) wedding without being married you can have all the same things that you would have in a marriage without the actual
(7:21:46) marriage would you have a wedding but not get like officially married like a
(7:21:51) celebration of like being together it sounds kind of i don't know you don't have to do like the whole white dress
(7:21:57) everything but just like a big party it would be so fun cry and it'll be great i
(7:22:03) had a dress on planned parenthood cake at my wedding it was great that was great it was fantastic i'll i'll take
(7:22:10) her like i i'll have like a valentine's day dinner with my girlfriend that is not a wedding that is not any a
(7:22:17) valentine's day dinner compared to okay but do you think you're going to find a girl that genuinely just doesn't just
() 
(7:22:23) wants to chill and never get married oh yeah yeah okay do you think she'll be a
(7:22:28) woman that's pure if that makes sense pure she's pure no like a virgin do you think you're going to meet a virgin who
(7:22:34) is they're secular virgins okay or do you think i'll just do you think you'll
(7:22:40) find someone that aligns with your values non-denominational christian but do you think you'll find someone that
(7:22:46) still aligns with your values even though they don't want to get married or do you think it'll be more difficult what do you mean like their libs like
(7:22:52) their libard like their [ __ ] liib like they don't they are fine without getting married but they have
(7:22:59) opposite morals or viewpoints than you uh no no i'm not wor i'm not too worried
(7:23:06) about it okay yeah okay i mean it's probably like more realistic that somebody who does want to get married
(7:23:12) could lean but i mean there's like feminist liberal women who want to get married too well that's true yeah so i
(7:23:18) mean i was just curious if like the feminist liberal if that would be a deal breakaker
(7:23:24) feminist like i mean yeah sure i mean i wouldn't if they were like pleasant but
(7:23:29) still liberal and but didn't want to get married would you yeah would that be the
(7:23:36) mind virus yeah i mean i think well one i think people have been brainwashed and
(7:23:42) propagandized so you there's some degree of like uh can you undo some of that
(7:23:48) stuff but uh typically i don't think i don't think i want to do the work to
(7:23:53) like deprogram some like pink-haired feminist lady so that's fair that's fair yeah not probably not my ideal um but
() 
(7:24:01) yeah i i don't know i marriage have i heard i don't know if i've heard a compelling no it's fair guess you got to
(7:24:07) understand become a christian or i could just i don't know i want like seven kids
(7:24:12) and stuff but do you actually i might have to come really i gave you look i i
(7:24:19) gave you the bible verse right what is it psalms whatever uh 137 psalms 127:4
(7:24:26) you know yeah i want like i want three sons at least so she pumps out seven
(7:24:31) daughters got to go three more we keep going we keep going until i get three sons i need
(7:24:38) three sons okay i used to want 20 kids been there 20 kids yeah i legit used to want 20 kids solid three is good i need
(7:24:46) for 20 years i know i like did the math and i was like "wait a minute i don't know this i need three sons." we can
(7:24:53) keep going after three but as long as you get three sons you're satisfied i need three sons because you got you got
(7:25:00) to i i want to have the brother dynamic but if one of them's a [ __ ] yes which
(7:25:07) i'm going to make sure i'm going to do my best to make sure they're not a [ __ ] there's got to be a backup but
(7:25:12) what if all of them are [ __ ] that you know what that's a scary thought or what
(7:25:17) if they've got some like [ __ ] up you know some like
(7:25:23) i know exactly no i know what you're talking about yeah yeah are you making a eugenics argument no i would i'm not
(7:25:31) saying i'm just saying like what if your kid is a little special [ __ ]
(7:25:40) i would still love him mhm but you might want if i could have a son
(7:25:45) who you might think when you have it what is that is that a bad i is that really a
(7:25:50) bad thought like i'd rather not have it would probably be expensive isn't that
(7:25:56) like terrible for the marriage also like i've heard horror stories statistically like for instance families
(7:26:02) with down syndrome statistically families who have a child with down syndrome are happier well so um wait
(7:26:09) hold on families wait families with a like with a child with a with down
(7:26:14) syndrome in any family people down syndrome they tend to have a very positive outlook
(7:26:20) are so nice so it's kind it's a little bit i don't know if that's like well if that's the case then we shouldn't we
(7:26:25) like be breeding more shouldn't we be breeding towards that no because our our society i would actually date somebody
(7:26:31) with down syndrome you've talked about this before i would date i would i would date i don't know if i'd like stay with
(7:26:37) her forever but just like as a novelty no like it's it's a serious like they really do like they're such happy people
(7:26:44) and it's so sad like we've in like places like like iceland they've completed completely eradicated down
(7:26:49) syndrome by avoiding every single baby i get i get it but like if i have sons they need to be able to go to war with
(7:26:55) me like why is war your goal no what i'm saying is i'm not saying like i want to
(7:27:01) go to a war when i say war i'm using it in like in a
(7:27:06) artistic sense of like we need to be i need to be able to go to war with my sons in like a uh what's the word live
(7:27:13) life fully together what's the uh you want to be able to relate to them in that way and connect with them what's
(7:27:19) the what's the term i'm masculine like kind of bond no no no but like i need to be able to go to war not literally but
(7:27:26) figuratively right yeah i just think it's different when you do have a child although to be fair down syndrome
(7:27:31) they're pretty strong physically so i think that they have that she knows what
(7:27:37) i'm talking about yeah have you seen the peanut butter falcon oh yeah i've seen that yeah good movie you know what i
(7:27:43) might be convinced you know what fine i won't be that upset if i knew i knew like two families that had
(7:27:50) guys it's jokes at the end of the show it's just jokes well i knew a family that had two a kid with down syndrome
(7:27:55) and then one adopted one with down and and they were doing just fine they were actually mormon one of them couples was
(7:28:01) mormon um but yeah i mean they it was cool and the kid went to our school and
(7:28:06) but is that a bad thing to say like i hope my kids aren't like is that normal no i don't think that's a
(7:28:14) you would be concerned about their future in a sense you're like oh my goodness like i think if as if i had a child if i bore a child and for some
(7:28:21) reason and there and they did have down syndrome i would be concerned like oh my goodness what's going to happen if i'm
(7:28:26) not here anymore who's going to take care of them do i have to get them a nursing home set up i'm i'm i are they going to treat them right at this
(7:28:31) nursing home that would be my concerns for the quality of life quality of life like quality of life and then and it's
(7:28:37) like i would still love them but i would want the best care and also if i couldn't take care of them the way that they needed to i would need to get them
(7:28:44) a nursing home i wouldn't want to abandon them i would have to get them a nursing home that they could be treated and then i could go visit because i
(7:28:51) can't what if they had a diaper or something and i couldn't you pick them up or something who knows and damn yeah
(7:28:57) big big thoughts about uh just to move things along here you said the artificial womb thing we'll touch on it
() 
(7:29:04) for one or two minutes it's just dehumanizing motherhood i just think it's dehumanizing to
(7:29:09) motherhood actually i have a question about artificial wombs for the two pro-choicers artificial wombs dismantle
(7:29:17) the my body my choice argument right if we could successfully create artificial
(7:29:22) wombs and just take the baby out and put it in the womb instead would you be supportive of that in abortion i'm going
(7:29:28) to be so honest my brain is kind of clocking out because i'm getting a little sleepy but i do think our
(7:29:36) feelies facial wombs are a little crazy but i think science like that is all crazy all i think all science like that
(7:29:42) is crazy like i science i love that thing um so here i'll have a little back
(7:29:48) and forth with you really quick on the artificial womb thing so i mean look my position isn't we make a mass transfer
(7:29:54) all women who are pregnant all women despite them wanting to complete a
(7:29:59) pregnancy we use an artificial womb i'm saying this would my argument for the
(7:30:05) artificial womb has always been this would be a compromise between pro-choice pro-life so okay uh you can save the
(7:30:13) life but the woman can end the pregnancy i so you transfer it to the artificial
(7:30:18) womb i know it's not ide probably not the ideal for both sides but it would be the it would be the compromise and it
(7:30:25) would honestly put this whole thing to rest i do think it's better than abortion but also i don't think it holds
(7:30:30) women accountable and they're not able to bond with that child because a lot of women might be like "oh i'm going to get an abortion." and then they get pregnant
(7:30:36) and they grow the child and they're like "holy crap i'm going to be a mother." right no yeah but i mean women also are
(7:30:42) you are you against adoption i have two adopted sisters now yeah but but so wouldn't that same argument apply to
(7:30:48) adoption right but like adoption is is a last resort but like with artificial
(7:30:54) wombs like when a woman is pregnant there's an exchange of cells between her and the baby and that's very important i mean the baby does bond like you said
(7:31:01) with the mother during pregnancy that's optimal for them so that when they're born they're able to have that really
(7:31:06) beneficial experience and that bonding so i think it's really i i mean i'd like to see more studies into it and i do
(7:31:12) think the artificial womb thing does dismantle the pro-choice argument to an extent there are approach racers that
(7:31:17) don't care think that you should be able to kill even though it's a human for other reasons um like destiny's argument
(7:31:23) but no i i think it is a interesting thing that i like to bring up because it i mean how about how about this assuming
(7:31:29) that it would in terms of its health its mental health and its uh bodily health
(7:31:36) if the artificial womb was able to meet the like the exact same uh health
(7:31:41) standards as a natural pregnancy or whatever uh what what are the objections
(7:31:47) there i guess i don't particularly have any objections other than the fact that it could go really wrong oh sure yeah
(7:31:53) there's like dystopian like really crazy things where they're like humans are being grown in like labs and stuff and
(7:32:00) women aren't needed anymore and we're just going to you know yeah those are those are concerns but i think like if
(7:32:06) you're looking at it in a vacuum like it is an interesting potential solution to
(7:32:12) the uh would you would you support ending abortion if artificial wombs were a thing um well i i think if artificial
(7:32:19) wombs were a thing that would be great but um i mean the person who got pregnant would still be in a different
(7:32:25) body than the artificial womb unless they could transfer over that baby to the artificial womb that's what that's what the argument is oh wait wait wait
(7:32:31) so so i never heard about that so they can transfer not yet but they're working on it i mean i would say yeah i i think
(7:32:39) i think if the woman wants to do that if there's no would there be would there be
(7:32:46) like health um like like like could you be like "oh my gosh well there's like the surgery and you could possibly die
(7:32:52) like in it if they couldn't if there was like zero chance i would i would question the person in a sense where i'm
(7:32:57) like "oh like huh like you couldn't transfer the baby to the artificial womb
(7:33:02) when when there was no health risks at all?" like i would be curious of why they would terminate it that that's what
(7:33:08) some i'd be concerned about that and i'd be like why why would you do that if if there's no risk to you but you would
(7:33:14) still think it should be legal to abort the baby when there's an alternative to just put them in an artificial womb oh sorry um i i do have i do apologize just
(7:33:22) for the sake of time i know it's getting late i do have to move things on just to get this wrapped up here pretty soon i'm going to let these chats come through
(7:33:28) liberty donated $29.99 yo thank you man chariot is based love
() 
(7:33:34) seeing her on thank you man she's definitely beautiful modest self-aware
(7:33:39) combats feminists she's probably one of the exceptions also wise with her words
(7:33:46) forever on the internet you want a quick response i i really appreciate that thank you
(7:33:52) all right we have lulu here lulu donated $30 brian what do you think of south
(7:33:58) korean plastic surgery sure looks natural and people who do it look undeniably prettier yeah that's actually
(7:34:04) a good point because uh i've seen some you know i think maybe surgery 10 years ago 20 years ago wasn't as advanced or
(7:34:12) as good so i've definitely seen videos of these transformations and it depends what they do but some of these uh
(7:34:20) plastic surgeries are re actually now very convincing and they don't actually
(7:34:25) many times they don't really look like they've had plastic surgery um
(7:34:31) they're very good um so i suppose in terms of
(7:34:36) aesthetically if if i've can't if it doesn't look bad then uh sure you can
(7:34:44) make an aesthetic argument that they look better and i think this is the case for
(7:34:49) uh like nose jobs um i've defin you know i got big nose
(7:34:57) [ __ ] i gota i gotta get me one of those um but i've like nose job what's
(7:35:02) interesting about that is that for nose jobs for i mean there's can be botched nose jobs but a nose job typically it'll
(7:35:12) match what could have been or what another nose looks like so to me that
(7:35:19) tends to have quite a big impact and it's actually remarkable what some what even just like a nose job can do but um
(7:35:26) what do i think about it i mean i'm still kind of the there's like a deception
(7:35:31) component because it's like okay if you're going to have kids with them and they're actually not that's not what they look like and then there's still
(7:35:37) like there's still the vanity component uh so like aesthetically yes they could be more physically attractive but
(7:35:43) there's still okay the vanity component uh do they have body dysmorphia that typically gets tied into like some other
(7:35:49) mental illnesses that's going to be an issue there's a financial issue of like okay are they gonna look to me as the
(7:35:56) provider to like pay for their future plastic surgeries their revisions their
(7:36:01) you know when they're 40 50 whatever they want me to pay for that [ __ ] do i want to pay for it probably not um so
(7:36:08) those are some components uh not really super in favor of plastic surgery but uh yeah some of that stuff's super
(7:36:15) convincing selena gour donated $30 i'm a man and i don't personally know any
(7:36:22) other men who prefer makeup or plastic surgery over a woman's natural look yep
(7:36:27) i think most of us are on team brixen #natural body supremacist natural i'm a
(7:36:33) natural body supremacist um thank you appreciate it speaking of which uh big labia matter okay all right uh we have
(7:36:40) this one from justin justin martins donated $30 burrito can't think of a
(7:36:46) good roast so i'll just say burrito so it's stuck in your head now as per usual

(7:37:44) makeup i think it's kind of stupid but why why is it stupid

(7:38:46) about that much okay uh that's cool uh body count i'm at
(7:38:54) four i'm at four four four yeah because casual sex doesn't benefit women so i
(7:39:02) period it's just my opin personal opinion i mean i don't hate on you're a [ __ ] liar you're a [ __ ] liar four
(7:39:09) i believe it okay sure sure fine i believe it three okay one zero
(7:39:18) uh it's a single digit you want to do a range like five to five to nine okay
(7:39:26) zero one cool oh wait hold on multiply it by
(7:39:34) three and that's the real number whatever you guys that's four yeah and the two i was i
(7:39:41) would dated wait question for m dog m dog are you uh
(7:39:47) are you waiting until marriage for your next guy or yeah i i was an atheist for a portion of my life i oh i see yeah but
(7:39:56) now i see i really see the value in that and god has definitely like redeemed my past and i'm grateful for the things
(7:40:02) that i believe in now and the faith that i hold i see go okay all right yeah uh
(7:40:08) that felt so good honestly it did wait can you hold up the makeup wipe to the oh yeah see it's only eyeliner i do not

(7:40:22) who cares all right sweet okay uh sweet we did that uh did the makeup rock and
(7:40:29) roll there's just like two or three things on here that we're going to do then we're going to wrap uh what would you want the minimum yearly income to be
(7:40:35) for your future husband actually i don't even know if there's any interesting answers here you know what i'm going to
(7:40:40) skip that one because there's nothing interesting i don't even think the height one there's no interesting things
(7:40:48) uh we'll do the bear though would you cross paths with a rand would you rather excuse me cross paths with with a random
(7:40:54) man or a random bear well the question said that it was on a hike and on a hike
(7:40:59) excuse me yeah yeah yeah and honestly uh the forest holds like the most unsolved
() 
(7:41:05) mysteries of the murders just because it's so big and anything could happen and not to be like yeah gabby patito but
(7:41:13) like there's just certain men that are out there that are a little evil and i'm not saying all men are evil but there
(7:41:19) are certain men that just have weird you know and i hate to say it but a bear what about you um absolutely a bear
(7:41:27) wait i sorry i do not want to run into a bear i've already okay so you pick you'd rather run into a man yes okay lydia
(7:41:34) yeah i'd run into rather run into a man man for sure i'd rather run into a a
(7:41:40) bear but if it was between a bull and a man i would pick a i'd pick a man because i'm scared of bulls because
(7:41:46) bulls will will i've seen some scary videos okay i've taken a nap with a bull not going to lie best sleep of my life
(7:41:55) um what was the question again man or bear um so i i choose so last time i
(7:42:00) chose bear um and i actually have a little bit of a story uh i was riding around on campus on my electric scooter
(7:42:08) and i actually saw a wild raccoon and got very frightened so i changed my man
(7:42:13) to i changed my answer to man because i think i would be much more terrified
(7:42:19) being around a wild bear okay what about you um i've tried to pet a bear my sister had to lock me in the car um
(7:42:25) autism woo uh but i would choose bear but if it was a group of men
(7:42:31) i would choose men simply because a bear cannot hurt me in the same way a man can
(7:42:37) i see and then the chat's going to okay abigail your answer man 100% you wrote a
(7:42:42) bear what you were a bear would you rather then i made the same mistake she is i'd rather run into a man okay all
(7:42:49) right all right uh so wait let's see well that's a good point because i don't know this whole like oh they'd rather
(7:42:55) come across a bear over a man i don't know i've like have y'all seen a spider
(7:43:01) it was a wild freak out over a spider okay so i watched faces of death because like my well my mom was in the police
(7:43:06) department and they had to watch this movie called faces of death my mom had us watch it me and my sister and the bear just whacked the guy's head off and
(7:43:13) it was real but the thing is is it was so quick and pain like like it was probably painful but it was just so quick that you know if a if a bear got
(7:43:20) me that would probably happen wait can you repeat the following me it was called faces of death no no uh repeat
(7:43:27) repeat this this one time at band camp this one time we watched no no no say
(7:43:33) like you're enthus this one time at band camp this one time we watched this movie
(7:43:39) oh no don't oh at band camp okay this one time this one time at band camp band camp we watched this movie american pie
(7:43:45) american pie uh all right wait so going to you uh let's see here caitlyn you said bear why
(7:43:52) um i asked my dad this because i honestly could not choose um simply because a man can hurt me in the exact
(7:43:59) um in a um man can hurt me worse than a bear can in a sure no like what they
(7:44:04) could do to me yeah they could essay yes that's way more terrifying than me having scars and bloodiness and stuff
(7:44:12) but if it was a group of men i would trust that the other men would protect me that's why i would choose a group of men over yeah what so you're doing a
(7:44:17) risk assessment what's the p uh percentage risk of a man a random man doing that oh absolutely very low i know
(7:44:24) that i know it's just to be clear so okay you wouldn't risk that that low
(7:44:29) risk over what i think many people would say is like a higher risk of a bear attacking you um actually bears don't
(7:44:36) attack often uh you just yell at them and they kind of run away uh i don't think that's really true it depends the bear it depends the bear cuz they say
(7:44:41) polar bears are crazy even black so in california this was a couple months ago a woman was carried killed by a black
(7:44:48) bear which is the one that said "oh the black bears you just make yourselves big and they go away." so i mean any bear
(7:44:54) can kill you experiences with bears have been positive how many experiences with bears have you had i've been to alaska
(7:44:59) so a lot from there um they you just honk the horn and they go away and then i tried to pet a bear i i tried to pet a
(7:45:05) bear but my sister locked me in the car and then a bear bribed my dog to stop barking at him with a deer leg yeah i
(7:45:11) ain't going to lie hey i've encountered bears and even though i would rather encounter encounter a man the bears weren't weren't that bad they just kind
(7:45:17) of went that same what are all these bear encounters okay there's actually a place called bear arizona in arizona
(7:45:23) that it's like a free it's a free-for-all walk and you can see bison and you can see bears and you can walk
(7:45:28) around them yes you have to sign a like a waiver but it's so cool but imagine how many but it's still so cool it's a
(7:45:34) good experience imagine how many people those animals see every single day though like that's the difference is
(7:45:40) that you choose you walk past a random bear in the wild you don't you don't i
(7:45:46) mean it's it's but the one time i did walk by one in the wild it didn't really do anything to me either yeah and i was
(7:45:51) in louis the potential like bears okay how about this would you rather walk up to a
(7:45:57) random bear and pat the random bear on the head or walk up to a random man and pat the random man on but i think the
(7:46:04) question is the fact that you know you shouldn't pet a bear anyway and a man yeah you shouldn't pet the man either
(7:46:09) yeah but that's exactly what i'm saying you don't know the man if i walked up to a random dude and started petting him he
(7:46:15) would fight you you know what honestly i think the chances are pretty good like random men so yes i could do that and
(7:46:22) there could be a some men that just depends on the man but it depends on the i would rather do that because i know
(7:46:28) like most men are just going to be like like they're going to look at me like the [ __ ] are you doing but i think most men are just going to
(7:46:34) let me do it and they're going to be give me a really weird look and be like "what the fuck?" i don't think they're going to like most men are not going to
(7:46:40) fight me and then i could just play that off with some comedy like "oh [ __ ] i'm sorry." but what if you get those weird like
(7:46:46) ignorant men that are like "why' you dare me to do it save some money if he wants to fight." but like okay uh final
(7:46:54) final thing here ryder these are your notes and then we're wrapping uh you said there's only three of them women do
(7:47:01) not have equal rights to men in the usa what do you what do you mean by this so you agree with that statement what do
(7:47:07) you uh mean i guess yeah like we just like we don't we don't have equal rights
(7:47:13) and that's why there's some women that are fighting for i guess equality but i mean it doesn't matter about my
(7:47:18) viewpoint on equal rights or anything but it's just the point of yeah i mean that's why i didn't circle that women
() 
(7:47:24) are oppressed because we're not oppressed there you have to be grateful
(7:47:31) because i mean like we said we are not going straight to the army we're not and it's cool to not it's cool to not have
(7:47:37) the same rights sometimes yeah but you said women don't have equal rights so what rights do men have that women don't
(7:47:42) they they go to the war you just said equal it doesn't matter bad or good they go to war wait hold on so the question
(7:47:50) was women don't have equal rights so uh men can be drafted women can't yeah what
(7:47:56) else okay men can't be d okay like the whole pay thing pay gap yeah okay whatever i mean i guess that's a con one
(7:48:02) instead of a pro one for me um but like yeah just like there's just different things of equal rights the whole thing
(7:48:08) of like our reproduction yeah like the reproduction yeah okay no not even abortion like maternity leave compared
(7:48:14) to paternity leave like paternity leave like you're not even carrying the baby yes i understand you had to be you had
(7:48:21) you have to be there as a present father which is good but it's also one of those things of like you didn't physically go
(7:48:28) through the 9 months maternity leave is typically shorter than maternity yeah but still like but that's what i'm saying they don't allow it for the nine
(7:48:34) months that i was pregnant you're not going to give me it's fine it's fine
(7:48:41) it's fine next one what was the next one uh what are the other rights that uh
(7:48:47) women don't have uh i don't know just things like that but like i'm saying draft uh bad or good regardless wage
(7:48:54) draft wage gap abortion patern like more paternal leave stuff like that men get
(7:49:00) patern how would men getting paternity leave they just do yeah but why but
(7:49:05) you're saying women don't have equal rights to men if women have maternity leave and they happen like lydia said
(7:49:11) have to have get more of a leave than when not typically all the time though
(7:49:17) almost always yeah but there's never a case where a guy will get more paternity leave at a company than a woman no no no
(7:49:23) i'm not talking about that i'm talking about the fact that it's not as long it's they even though they get it it's
(7:49:29) not as long as you should be in there for the child's life and it sucks because a worker you could tell your worker and you could be like "hey i just
(7:49:35) had a baby." and they're going to be like "okay well i expect you back in 5 months." when you're like i want to be there for the first kind of 10 years but
(7:49:42) my job's not going to be promised to me when i so that's what i'm saying good or
(7:49:48) bad we don't have the same rights that's why i didn't put women are oppressed cuz we're not oppressed to be clear are you saying that women have more rights than
(7:49:54) men no not more because this would be an argument that men that's why i'm saying it's a pro and con list of like we just
(7:50:00) it's not the same rights they're not equal they're not the same equal means the same and that's it but typically
(7:50:06) like the the context and the phrasing here would indicate women do not have equal rights to men would indicate like okay what rights do women not have but
(7:50:13) that's how you're taking it the question was literal so but so you're saying but the question was literal oh that's what i'm saying i think i yeah i think i'm
(7:50:20) understanding what you're saying so women get more uh maternity leave and
(7:50:25) you think that that's like a detriment to men yeah i guess not not a detriment
(7:50:30) but it's just the fact of like when a man who's it unfair to men or women it's unfair to both cases actually to be
(7:50:37) honest because a man should be there for his kids after because you want a present father but yes you do want the
(7:50:43) hard work i see what you're saying but that's what i'm saying but the women went through okay you said the draft so is that yeah it's just not the same
(7:50:50) equal right you said equal right and we're not going to go to the front of the line so that's what i'm saying that's why i
(7:50:56) didn't circle women are oppressed because i don't believe that i just believe that we don't have the same rights and equal means the same okay so
(7:51:02) you're saying bad or so men don't have as many rights as women then uh no i didn't say that i just said they weren't
(7:51:09) equal do men have more rights i i mean i didn't decide to go down the whole list i just knew i just knew out of the four
(7:51:16) i was like they're not equal i'm asking you a new question do men not have as many rights as women
(7:51:23) no i think uh do men have more rights than women i think they set the system up because obviously when they made this
(7:51:29) system like whenever you know the founding fathers like how we were talking about when they when they set up
(7:51:35) the system for like the draft um not letting women vote everything they set that system up so that was what i'm
(7:51:41) saying and then women got it throughout later so that's what i'm saying doesn't matter when it came doesn't matter what it like how it happened but they just
(7:51:48) weren't equal like the mount rushmore president yeah yeah yeah that's what i'm saying i don't believe women are oppressed no but like that's what i'm
(7:51:55) saying we just don't have equal rights bad or good like e whether the whether the right benefits women or does not
(7:52:01) benefit women they're just not equal like but so men don't have the same rights as so okay when it comes to the
(7:52:08) draft are you what do you are you wanting women to be drafted no so is it
(7:52:13) a is it right but are you arguing that it's but there's some women out there that will argue i'll explain it i'll
(7:52:19) explain it so are you saying that it's a it's like a lack of rights that women
(7:52:26) aren't drafted like is that what you're arguing yeah i guess lack of rights like
(7:52:31) because isn't it a privilege that like that's a yeah that's what i'm saying it's a privilege it's a it's a good reason female
(7:52:37) privilege but that's what i'm saying but it's also the same it's not the same right as a man it's not a right though
(7:52:42) it's a yeah i guess but it's not a right but you put all rights like yeah but it's not a right you i if it was a right
(7:52:50) wouldn't i have the choice to refuse to be drafted so it's a duty it's not a
(7:52:55) right like a right can't be added to your argument it's what he said because it's not included in rights yeah but
(7:53:02) rights don't even exist but um exactly so in general uh okay i all right you
(7:53:09) said that male privilege exists and you also you said men are more
(7:53:14) privileged in society than women yeah cuz just like the whole thing about like how you said exactly it would take a lot
(7:53:20) for a man to be a [ __ ] like it would take a lot just because the way that society views women and they believe
(7:53:27) just the societal norms of just being like that and that's it like so i mean
(7:53:33) so men can be [ __ ] that's the male privilege no no no it's not but they could get away with more things men have
(7:53:39) to go to war and die men have to go to war and die but they can also be [ __ ] so like balances out but no it doesn't
(7:53:46) balance out nobody should go to war and die like that's what i'm saying but the way when they set the system up to be
(7:53:51) like we got to send the highest people out on the front of the line yeah they don't smoke weed typically and when they
(7:53:57) go to war oh well that's not what i meant i was talking about like highest ranking like on the asba test on stuff
(7:54:02) like that when you get into the military like were you in the military no well i mean i took the asvab but they said i couldn't go cuz i was the only woman
(7:54:09) like child so they literally told me no like so so i could have pursued the
(7:54:14) military instead of going to college but since um i mean this but i i don't i kind of reject this idea that like oh
(7:54:19) men set that system up like what does it have i don't think it really has to do with men because ultimately it was like
(7:54:26) 0.00001% of people who had the power to well they were the only ones that were able to vote and make the no actually
(7:54:33) for the vast majority of human history neither men or women could vote yeah it's but they were able to propose it
(7:54:40) like john hancock benjamin fang they were the only ones that were able to propose years ago yeah but that's what
(7:54:45) i'm saying that's how they set the system up around there queens and monarchs and that sort of thing and actually if there's when it comes to
(7:54:51) warfare queens were much more likely to uh go to war kings there was a study on
(7:54:57) this queens were much more likely to go to war than their male counterparts mhm
(7:55:04) so this idea that oh if we lived in a matriarchy where we lived with like female rulers there would be less war or
(7:55:09) no war actually history seems to dictate that it's actually not the case women were more likely to initiate wars than
(7:55:17) men were okay okay all right i mean in any case
(7:55:25) it's not clear to me so okay here's my argument here you're saying men are more privileged in society than women
(7:55:32) yeah but i think you have to and so i guess i would be willing to grant that
(7:55:38) male privileges exist and i think female privileges also exist oh yeah yeah yeah
(7:55:43) yeah females could get away with more things ever yeah of course i believe the ultimate minority is the individual and
(7:55:49) so when you talk about privilege you need to look at the totality of somebody stop guys you need to you need to look
(7:55:57) at the totality of somebody's circumstances so for example like let's say there's um let's say there's a given
(7:56:04) male privilege right and this male privilege is let's say it was in
(7:56:11) the 1914 and he had the right to vote right uh but then okay this male
(7:56:19) privilege exists or i mean how about this let me do a different example can you just tell me some male privileges
(7:56:26) no actually i can't no yeah don't know any i can't think right now of anything
() 
(7:56:32) i'm like i'm going to be honest i'm starting to like check out so i'm trying to think as much as i can so yeah yeah
(7:56:37) anything can you give me one or two male privileges i would just basically say like um they were able to like rent a
(7:56:44) car and they were able to create debt and yeah stuff like that they were able to get credit cards and yeah and that's
(7:56:49) yeah just stuff like little things like that but like i'm saying not to say i believe that women should not have
(7:56:56) credit cards because i i believe from from my personal experience we should
(7:57:02) debit yes you should stick to debit yeah i should stick to debit definitely i mean i'm fine with credit but um look i
(7:57:09) guess my ultimate point here on this is that i think you have to look at the individual level to determine if there
(7:57:15) if this privilege is even helpful for example like if male privilege is
(7:57:20) blanket and all males have male privilege like i don't think we would say that in totality a individual is
(7:57:27) privileged if the following uh they have it's a three-year-old with cancer but
(7:57:34) he's male like i don't think in totality we would ever say that a three-year-old who has terminal cancer and is going to
(7:57:40) die in 3 months has privilege despite them being male right and like what privilege does that male have but that's
(7:57:47) personal over a three-year-old girl who doesn't have terminal cancer i would say
(7:57:52) like okay so yeah but that's a that's extreme like right but you have to look at totalities of circumstances before we
(7:57:58) can like consider privilege like okay so if there's male privilege but what about
(7:58:04) the totality of the individual circumstances of someone's given life
(7:58:10) so like for example i'm male but like i have chronic pain issues and so like i would happily trade my supposed male
(7:58:17) privilege for like a better back for for female good mhm i'll trade my superior
(7:58:23) male privileges for female privileges if my like i could be able-bodied or i
(7:58:28) could not have like debilitating pain a lot of people would right what i'm saying is is this idea and well men are
(7:58:35) much more likely to suffer from like chronic pain and this sort of thing and have like injuries because they are typically
(7:58:40) employed in in blue fields laborious jobs where they're more likely to be
(7:58:45) injured and so for this re and they're more likely to be injured on the job they're more likely to die on the job
(7:58:50) and so for this reason you got to yeah i would absolutely if i could get rid of my chronic pain give me a i'll take a
(7:58:57) period give me a [ __ ] give me menration as a dude i'll pee blood out of my
(7:59:04) if my back you don't pee blood i hope you know it comes from i'm like i hope you know he would get cramps those are
(7:59:10) bad there's only men only have a urethra so it would come out it would kind of be
(7:59:15) there's a machine that you can put that gives guys cramps
(7:59:20) you should definitely try that the cramp machine simulator comparison to pregnancy here's the thing though i
(7:59:25) think uh on that uh men get kidney stones but so do women also get kidney
(7:59:32) stones but women have reported women who have had kidney stones report that it's worse than pregnancy pain and i think
(7:59:39) there's like physiological differences between men and women when it comes to kidney stones and the pain associated
(7:59:44) with it because it i i mean i don't know if there's different i whatever in any case um this idea that like pregnancy
(7:59:50) pain is the worst thing ever but like men get the kidney stones well also though you have to remember that your body releases hormones that makes make
(7:59:57) you forget the pain of child birth so there's that too female privilege female
(8:00:03) privilege ridiculous okay we have a chat here streamlabs oh my god streamlabs is not working that's i don't know what the
