(0:00) i think in a majority situations women do though deserve less right because they have this egalitarian mindset where they think that they're equal to a man
(0:05) but at the same time they want a guy that's superior to them do women want men who they feel are superior to them
(0:12) yes okay in what ways the question is is what are women bringing to the table or are women the table that's the question
(0:19) let me ask you about this equality though when you're talking about equality what they really want is they want to have the same social status
(0:26) absent the responsibility am I the for telling my wife she's not a single parent just because I work long hours
(0:33) you're working you get to get out of the house and now I have to stand here with the kids it's not fair tell her to shut her mouth how can I get him to stop
(0:39) caring that I was with guys before him i feel like every single girl has a list of the guys she's ever been with that
(0:46) guy probably thought he was getting involved with somebody different she's saying go find women like her dump your load them and move on because that's
(0:53) what makes them the women they are today for their man what is a traditional woman to me you're asking me mhm to me a
(1:00) traditional woman is someone who
(1:05) All right everyone welcome brand new Jedi show today and we have a very
(1:12) special guest is in the house we've got Andrew Wilson oh yeah he's been stirring it up over at whatever podcast we've
(1:18) covered some of that we're going to ask him about it um he is at the Crucible over at YouTube Paleoccon on Twitter and
(1:26) more he'll tell you what he wants to plug and all that but first of all Andrew welcome um I have been bugging
(1:31) you you know you said you would come on and then you were out in California doing whatever podcast and all that
(1:37) stuff and I've been bugging you for a while for good reason um so welcome
(1:42) first of all thank you um you caused a boatload of trouble over at whatever
(1:48) podcast so we tuned in you debated first of all God bless you man because these are very
(1:55) lengthy debates with people that aren't packed too tight if you know what I mean you had a male feminist you had a female
(2:01) feminist who I think had some type of health problem and then was like turning the whole show into like "Oh I need to
(2:06) leave but if you give me enough money I'll stay." Was mad so what first of all
(2:12) what's your takeaway of that whole experience so um I don't mind doing long form
(2:19) debates and I don't mind doing short form debates my my in my heart I'm a
(2:24) debater um I'm an entertainer first and foremost but debate is where kind of my
(2:30) passion is i enjoy doing that more than anything else so when they line up long form debates I'm always happy to do it
(2:36) especially with feminists and uh male feminists especially because um they're
(2:41) even dumber than the female feminists usually so I always uh I always enjoy tangling up with them uh especially
(2:47) progressive leftists i uh I have a special seething hatred in my heart for all of them so um yeah I I've I've
(2:55) always enjoyed doing that kind of stuff um it's very taxing it's very tiring to do those four or five days in a row but
(3:02) um always happy to do it is there a difference for you debating the female feminist versus the male feminist
(3:08) because I always say that you know when you debate a woman I don't know if you can think back to even like when Hillary Clinton was on the debate stage there's
(3:15) a certain thing that happens with masculine energy right where women are immediately able to play the misogynist
(3:21) card like you're sexist you're misogynist you're talking over me you're interrupting me does that also like does
(3:26) that change the dynamic do you prefer debating a guy over a woman or do you change your strategy of your tone or
(3:34) whatnot to kind of appeal to the a like how do you work that machine
(3:39) they want to be interchangeable widgets i treat them like men i love it easy
(3:44) they want to They They say that they're men that they're interchangeable with men so I treat them like men and they
(3:50) always get pissed off that I treat him exactly the same way that I would treat a man who was on the debate stage and one of the things that pisses feminists
(3:56) off the most is that anytime they make a comparison with my debates with men they can't say I'm treating them any
(4:02) different h maybe that's the strategy then that guys that hit the debate stage as more women start running for office
(4:08) and all that stuff maybe that is the lesson that you heard right there also by the way people were getting real twisted about your wife your wife uh was
(4:15) going on Twitter and I guess she's uh what how does she define herself a patriarchist is that what she says is it
(4:21) Yeah she was People were not happy with her too they were going for her i don't know if you saw that
(4:28) people have been uh consistently after me and my wife since day one uh the goal there is to create division
(4:35) where it's impossible to create division so you cannot create uh division between me and my wife you can't get a piece of
(4:41) paper between us so I think it's hilarious though that people will endlessly try to play the divide and
(4:48) conquer card um it's just never It's fascinating maybe we'll have her on too she's way she's way way too whipped
(4:56) maybe we'll have her on too at some point to to hear her thoughts on I wonder how much she and I align uh or
(5:02) don't i I don't know i have a follower enough to know but that would be an interesting thing well she has a great book it's called A Cult Feminism it's
(5:09) been a a bestseller on uh on Amazon in its category for almost two years and uh
(5:15) she's also an excellent debater i would consider her to be the premier uh female anti-feminist debater in the world well
(5:21) that's good maybe we'll have her on then i'm gonna make a little note to myself on the side all right this is a reaction
(5:27) show so what we're going to do is we're going to show some clips and we're going to use that to offshoot into broader
(5:33) conversations um some of them are going to be silly and some of them are going to be a little bit meteor but I want to
(5:39) get your reaction to these and uh then we'll talk about things like equality um
(5:44) party phases all of it we've even got some cool stuff from Rich Cooper here about guys that are saying it might be
(5:50) for just being a man so we'll get to that all right everyone before we start I want you to hit that subscribe button i want you to hit that like button and
(5:56) put your notes in the comments it helps us with the algorithm it helps us to grow which you're doing an amazing job of but let's get on it
() 
(6:05) how many guys you knocking down on spring break cuz it seems like you're just going wild he's going pretty how many guys you knocked down hashi we lost
(6:11) count after like 12 you 12 guys on spring break how many more guys you knocking down on a regular weekend I'd
(6:18) probably say three you three guys a weekend okay so these are they look like babies
(6:25) to me and it's what's really astounding is that like I feel like the ages is getting it's getting younger and younger
(6:30) even the OF girls we just showed a girl who's 22 and she's got like a baby face she looks like a child right so these
(6:35) look like children to me um granted I'm a little older but still you know this it's it's jarring to hear young women
(6:42) that look like children have baby faces talking about how they're knocking back three guys in a weekend um spring break
(6:49) sleeping with 12 guys that's one week 12 guys so the perception by these women is
(6:56) that when you're young this is first of all the new thing to do and they're all saying well you know guys aren't going
(7:02) to not go out with me because they're not going to have any other choice because we're all doing this and the perception is that when they get to be
(7:08) 20 five 30 if they stop that behavior that this doesn't matter anymore like
(7:14) guys aren't going to go back and care about this so what what do you make of that do guys still care about this stuff
(7:20) is there room to care about this stuff if so many women are behaving like this and like what what is the future of
(7:25) these women that are talking like this right now yeah men care about it and they increasingly care about it more and
(7:32) more and more the the big problem with out of the thousands of conversations I've had with women like this I
(7:38) understand what the issue is it's an issue of fairness in their brain they think that men are out there being
(7:44) promiscuous and screwing everything that they can right they're trying to get in the pants of every woman that they see
(7:49) that's that that is literally what these women think and so they think well if men can be promiscuous there's nothing
(7:54) wrong with me being promiscuous it's only fair the problem is is that the fairness mindset doesn't actually work
(8:01) right relationships aren't fair uh interexual dynamics aren't fair men are stronger than you for instance that's
(8:08) not fair all right they're more logically and stoic-minded that's not fair there's all sorts of unfair
(8:14) advantages that men have in life and there's also unfair advantages that women have in life in comparison to men
(8:19) they don't have to get drafted go fight wars they don't have to do all sorts of things that uh fall on the backs of men
(8:25) but the reason that women have no problem whatsoever being promiscuous and talking about it on camera and being
(8:31) happy and giddy about it and talk you know I' I've heard some of the the worst most disgusting interviews ever you know
(8:37) there was a chick who was recently talking on Twitter about how she she her and her husband have conversations about
(8:42) all the men who have been inside her right these women yeah these women are horrific but from their perspective it's
(8:49) only fair the future for women like this is the same as the uh the current uh
(8:56) status that we see for women like this who were very promiscuous back in high school things like it doesn't work out well it never works out well and now
(9:04) your online reputation follows you forever it's not like when we were younger you can't just move to a new
(9:10) town and reinvent yourself doesn't work that way anymore what do you think it is about these women that is most
(9:16) unattractive to men is it the loose like is it is it the lack of self-respect is
(9:21) it the damage that they incur then by virtue of all this behavior and then you know they're bitter and and difficult to
(9:27) be around and blaming you for past things or what is it exactly if you could like hit the nail on the head that
(9:35) turns guys off with the high body count girls yeah it comes down to biological reproduction why are men attracted to
(9:42) youthful looking women who have um like shapely hips you know a good buttocks uh
(9:49) a nice ample bosom right all of those things are attracted to those things because it it signals reproduction in
(9:55) our brain and so if what signals reproduction is what we want to have sex
(10:00) with right that's the whole point you're signaling in our brain reproduce reproduce reproduce and sex ultimately
(10:06) is for reproduction right that is what its actual function is so you're attracted to these various traits in
(10:13) women for the purposes of reproduction now we're way past reproduction we have condoms and birth control and abortion
(10:20) and everything else but in our brains attraction wanting to have sex that is
(10:28) in line with wanting to reproduce that's the whole point of it right that's why it's ingrained in men uh to be attracted
(10:35) to women is so that we will reproduce with them major problem here the reason it's so revolting is how would you as a
(10:42) man be able to let's say 200 years ago or a 100red years ago uh figure out
(10:47) paternity how would you do that how would you know if the child was yours what would be the big signal for that
(10:52) well the big signal for that would be chastity virginity things like this those are the only way you could assure
(10:58) your own paternity and not become a cuckled but with so many women doing this now and the age of the women doing
(11:05) this it's getting like lower and lower and lower is there going to be options for guys to not embrace women who are
(11:13) behaving like this what is the option are there enough women not doing it yeah yeah so the thing is is that as far as a
(11:20) mating strategy goes trends for women they shift around right you see this big
(11:26) kind of return online now to the tradife sphere right it's all about the trad but
(11:31) now they're mixing in as much sexuality with the tradife stuff as they possibly can too but what what I've noticed is
(11:38) that women who more embrace that sphere they get a lot they actually get a lot of male attention from a lot of the same
(11:44) types of men that the uh kind of skanks actually want so in is there a future in
(11:49) the next 10 years where there's kind of a um a return to that to a more chasteed
(11:55) kind of uh lifestyle for women i mean I doubt it but it's possible you know it's
(12:01) possible i'm not I'm not totally blackpilled i don't think there's no future here uh for men and men also
(12:07) they'll you know they move over to other countries they get wives that way they yeah they do they do all sorts of uh
(12:14) various strategies to find themselves uh women who have a low body count now you know and some some men don't care that's
(12:20) true some of them don't but for the ones who do those women do exist they are out there there's there's not going to be
(12:26) enough supply to meet the demand i have a question for you offshooting just a little bit off topic um that occurs to
() 
(12:32) me a lot when you look at traditional men with traditional values who want a
(12:38) traditional woman right they claim they want a traditional woman what I'm seeing happen a lot which is kind of disturbing
(12:44) to me is traditional guys who say "Yeah I'm a masculine guy i want a feminine woman i want a traditional woman." All
(12:50) this stuff and then they get married to a woman and they have their wife and
(12:56) then they have the nanny and then they have the chef and then they have the opair and the person who comes to clean
(13:03) the house and they really don't have a traditional wife at all they have a
(13:08) trophy wife and then a bunch of hired help and that's there's something wrong
(13:13) with that there's also something wrong with to me you know a woman who wants to
(13:18) be married but doesn't want to be a wife a woman who wants children but doesn't want to be a mom so my question is
(13:24) because I I talked to a lot of these guys they've got money so yeah you know does that open doors sure but you can't
(13:30) tell me that you want a traditional woman if that woman is really not doing any of the traditional tasks at all and
(13:36) is kind of removed from the children you know that there's a nanny in between there's a a housekeeper doing like what
(13:42) is she doing all day long other than look pretty and maybe she's got the long nails and the hair extensions and looks like a a Barbie doll great but that's
(13:48) not a traditional woman so what what is going on here what do they really want and is it is there a schism here in
(13:54) terms of men well I think we got to I think we got to break a couple of things down here first the nanny that you know
(14:01) the nanny housekeeper thing that's unavailable to the vast majority of couples and men um I mean it's
(14:07) completely unavailable to most people so that that requires a level of income that that most couples don't have at
(14:13) least not starting out maybe later in life you know 15 20 years but the overwhelming majority of people can't
(14:19) afford to have in in-person housekeeping and chefs and things like that that's not uh that's not a thing that's very
(14:25) common in most American households but when you're talking about traditional what do you mean by that what does that
(14:31) mean when you say a traditional woman what is a traditional woman to me you're asking me to me a traditional woman is
(14:38) someone who prioritizes being a wife a mom takes care of her own kids doesn't
(14:44) put them in daycare you know doesn't work you know has a child and all of
(14:49) that changes you know cooks food enjoys taking care of the home cleans her own
(14:55) house um you know so why can't uh why can't a woman who's screwed like you
(15:01) know 200 guys do that for a guy though they can right well they can sure they
(15:07) can so that that doesn't seem to be kind of getting at what it is well that's not the body count conversation though this
(15:12) is a separate conversation irregardless of body yeah but I wouldn't consider Right but when I when I think of
(15:17) traditional or traditional woman or traditional man I'm thinking of masculinity and femininity which I
(15:24) attribute to virtues so I consider there to be feminine and masculine virtues now
(15:29) all virtues are shared but the way that you know it's a masculine virtue you know it's a feminine virtue is that if
(15:35) one sex drops that virtue society is doomed an example of this if women lost
(15:40) courage for 24 hours it would suck there would be a lot of bad things but if men
(15:46) lost courage for 24 hours society would come to a screeching halt if it was the case that all men became promiscuous
(15:53) tomorrow that would be bad but it would be way worse if all women became promiscuous tomorrow and so you can tie
(15:59) the virtues in that's how you know what is a feminine virtue and what is a masculine virtue when I when I think
(16:06) traditional I think virtue a virtuous woman or uh a masculine uh man these
(16:13) would be virtues for men right so it' be virtue on both sides when you say traditional and you just mean like does
(16:19) the laundry right does the laundry cooks food things like that i think ultimately that misses the point i think what men
(16:26) are trying to get is virtuous women i don't care for instance that I have a
(16:32) submissive woman who does my laundry and rubs my feet if she sucked 200 in her
(16:38) life right i don't want that chick i don't want her so why because she's lacking the element that I care the most
(16:45) about which is virtue so I think you got people have to be kind of careful on the
(16:51) topic when you're talking about traditional men or uh traditional women because often times it's also the case
(16:57) that some of these men they might be looking for quote a traditional woman who does these things but have no virtue
(17:03) themselves so virtue uh is something which which has to be tied into the conversation when you're talking about
(17:09) traditionalism because that's what makes it traditional virtue i find that that
(17:14) it often goes hand in hand though when I when I see a lot of the women who don't and I'm not talking about you know you
(17:22) have enough money so you can have help i'm talking about a distaste for these things there there are women that I
(17:28) encounter that have a distaste for taking care of the home a distaste for
(17:33) putting you know cooking a good meal it's it's it it's viewed as a they've been programmed to believe it's it's a
(17:38) form of slavery and I find that your virtue conversation goes in line with
(17:43) that because often times those are the women with a past it just it just aligns a lot of time like it it just does
(17:50) whereas these women who are virtuous and I know you're talking about morals you're talking about things you know
(17:55) decisions they've made how many men they've been with you know when they lost their virginity all all these things right i find that those women
(18:02) often will be the very ones who also do naturally feel inclined to take care of a home do naturally want to be a
(18:08) supportive wife do naturally prioritize their children it just falls in line so I think it has to be I do think it's
(18:15) relevant though um to have a conversation about both because I also don't think it's virtuous as a woman to
(18:22) you know have children and then not be the primary like not not take care of them to be absent hey go into daycare so
(18:28) I can go work you know x amount of hours i don't think that's virtuous i don't think it's But we have to but we have to
(18:34) get again some delineations here are you going to send your kids to public school no no okay but if a woman sends her kids
(18:42) to public school is she a failure is she doing something wrong there i mean I'm a I'm a proponent of homeschooling and you
(18:48) know I'm not but is but is it actually is are they lacking virtue at that point
() 
(18:53) because they utilize the public school system uh the the way the essentially
(19:00) society is set up in a two-income household is that schools are your built-in baby i I don't think that's
(19:06) virtuous though like I don't think that when you have a child as a woman you should be in a two-income household
(19:13) somebody has to raise these children and either it's going to be you or it's going to be the state or it's going to be like it just can't it you can't I I
(19:21) get people find themselves in financial predicaments but that's why I think this
(19:26) whole balance is is messed up where guys are supposed to be earning the money i do think that it it look what you create
(19:32) when you put these kids in these school systems but let's but let's look at this like from a bird's eye view so I agree
(19:37) with you i'm a big proponent of homeschooling my wife's online handle is based homeschool mom right um big
(19:44) proponent of it and I agree with you that the the state uses indoctrination centers called public school systems in
(19:49) order to produce the feminists of tomorrow but let's say you're 22 years old and you get married to uh you know a
(19:57) 22-year-old woman uh she's in her most fertile years you can have the most amount of children possible or you can
(20:04) defer until you're a little bit more financially stable in your 30s where she can have very few if you're bringing in
(20:10) an income at 22 of let's say 40 50,000 a year uh that's really tough at that
(20:17) point isn't it to uh to to have kids and have a stay-at-home
(20:22) uh wife so if the wife is out of the home working is that a signal against
(20:27) virtue or is that the necessity of society and she's inside of the supportive home i would still say do
(20:33) everything you can whether that means you move to a place that's not super expensive whether that means that I mean
(20:39) this is this is a bigger conversation too I think about the breakdown of community and extended family and how people used to live because grandma and
(20:46) grandpa used to be involved and there used to be a community of people that were family that were nourishing and
(20:53) helping and and and it was just a different life it was a much healthier life for everyone but I would say I get
(20:58) this question a lot from people and then I look at where they come from and they're in like New York City and I say well get yes in New York City you can't
(21:05) survive on that but I live in a small town in Texas right now and I will tell you that there are plenty of moms the
(21:11) dad is a firefighter and the mom stays at home and that's a decision that they are making and the mom homeschools and
(21:18) it's really doable they're they have live in nice homes and they they do what they need to do to make that a priority
(21:24) so I think that that needs to be I think it's possible for some i think it's possible for some what I would always
(21:30) recommend in these cases is um I don't think that it's a a smack on your virtue that you're you know your kids may go to
(21:37) public school for a short period of time what I would say is that there's a lot of people who plan for an escape they
(21:42) think of it like a prison and I think that that's the right way to think of it i think that they're in these major
(21:48) metropolitan areas and they're thinking they get together with their wife and they sit down to come up with a plan of action for escaping right escaping the
(21:55) human zoo and so they go "Okay for the next 5 years you're going to work and I'm going to work and we're going to put
(22:01) every penny away till we get out of these major cities or get somewhere where you can then stay at home with the
(22:06) kids." I'm not willing to kind of knock that or say that that's virtuous or say that because it is the case that you're
(22:12) utilizing all the resources which are available for you to kind of plan your escape from this diabolical system uh
(22:20) that you're doing something wrong in fact I'd say you're doing something right at that point uh I did that right
(22:26) i I did the exact same thing i sat down and plotted and planned meticulously my escape uh from you know the kind of the
(22:33) kind of horrible internal city lives uh which people find themselves in inside of these i agree with you 110%
(22:42) i and I don't think there's a lack of virtue in that path however I do think there's a lack of virtue in a path that
(22:49) is perfectly comfortable with that whole world with you know oh it's more important for me essentially to be
(22:55) working and it's no big deal to drop my kid off at daycare at 6 months old for you know 8 hours a day and then go into
(23:02) a school system that you know whatever they learn at school oh they'll survive you know they'll be fine yeah but aren't those women a self-correcting problem in
(23:08) many ways like the type of What happens to their kids though that's the thing that's true well it's true but here's
(23:14) the thing if we look at the stats and we see the reproduction rates of the heavily religious for instance against
(23:21) the kind of secular bimbos that you're talking about uh you know they they have one kid you know sometimes two but
(23:29) usually they have one and if you look at the birth rate in the United States in a big fat nose dive a lot of them don't
(23:34) have any you know the future really doesn't belong to women like this anyway and they it's true they don't prioritize
(23:41) their children the right way and they end up with kind of monstrous kids some of them make it out okay not not many
(23:46) but some of them do uh but I do think that the future doesn't really belong to those people anyway that ultimately
(23:52) these people think themselves right out of existence imagine deferring your family as a woman until you're in your
(23:58) 30s right that's not the time to be having kids i know I did yeah your body
(24:04) doesn't exactly bounce right back does it not like when I mean at 22 23 years
(24:10) old women will go in and have a child and be back at work the next day i like they just bounce right back that doesn't
(24:16) happen in your 30s and you can only have so many right and the stressors that it puts on you the stressors that it puts
(24:22) the links between the autistic and the late deferment of child care or uh child
(24:29) having is huge it's probably the number one correlated link with autism is that we have an aging female population
(24:35) having children it's a terrible idea 90% of the time it's a terrible idea you
(24:41) should start in your 20s then by the way that's when all of human civilization always started argue too yeah yeah or or
(24:49) uh you know uh late teen 17 18 19 that was very common even 16 in some cultures
(24:54) now I'm not recommending that i'm just saying that if you look at uh human reproduction pathways your 20s are where
() 
(25:02) it's at and that's when you should be starting but there's unique challenges now that other people didn't have a
(25:09) hundred years ago we don't have crossgenerational wealth anymore there's no centennial farms uh that people are
(25:16) growing up on you're basically in a human zoo so when people ask and they say "Hey wait a second look I'd love to
(25:23) get married to uh my high school sweetheart." But man you know it takes 10 years to establish a career even in a
(25:31) trade where I can really start making the kind of money that's necessary to take care of my family look I agree i
(25:36) know I was a tradesman my whole life but what I can say is this get married anyway start having the kid
(25:43) plot the escape plot smart about the Yeah plot the escape plot getting the
(25:50) out of there and getting somewhere like you're saying a place where there's a a better cost of living there's going to
(25:55) be some sacrifice now maybe you're not going to get the great California weather i didn't okay i get the Michigan
(26:01) winner which lasts 9 months but uh the cost of living is significantly
(26:08) decreased and I was able to on one income a tradesman income take care of an entire household now I had to cut out
(26:14) all the vacations i had to cut all that stuff out but we were able to do it now did my does that mean my wife never
(26:20) worked of course not uh there's times where we got behind um you know financially behind or the car does
(26:27) something like this hey it's time for some part-time work that women have always uh worked in some capacity to
(26:35) support their husbands in their primary role so I think we got to be really careful when we talk about traditional
(26:41) what we mean by that what I mean by that is that you're marrying a woman of great virtue and that she's marrying a man of
(26:48) great virtue that's what we're looking for here not the idea of like oh she cleans the stocks by hand and bakes your
(26:56) cookies right because ultimately those are kind of tangential side excellent point i want to talk um Fresh and Fit
(27:03) has a short out that addresses the issue of equality so let's play number two and then we'll talk about male and female
(27:09) equality and why that twists people when you say women deserve less it's
(27:15) like immediately like I think in a majority situations women do though deserve less right because they have this egalitarian mindset where they
(27:22) think that they're equal to a man but at the same time they want a guy that's super fair to them women want taller money but then they expect you to treat
(27:28) them equal they think I just need to be pretty and exist it's a more of a what can you do for me type mindset and you're here to get me i don't need to
(27:34) necessarily do anything for you so I wish more women had that critical thinking of like okay he's really good at this let me kind of come in and fill
(27:40) in other roles but a lot of women don't do that unfortunately okay so this idea of equality um I want to just dig into
(27:47) first of all do women want men who they feel are superior to them yes okay in
(27:53) what ways uh well they want them to make more money obviously they want them to
(27:58) be stronger than them obviously uh but more importantly they want them to have
(28:04) something that most women never get which is the respect of other men so one
(28:09) of the big things um that you'll see online this phenomenon really comes out online is the idea of the pickme you've
(28:16) heard that term pick me i'm sure you get called pick me all the time right all the time and many many women do really I
(28:24) think what the feminist says is the Pikmi is a a woman who's starved for
(28:29) male attention so just tells men what they want to hear thus betraying the sisterhood uh but that's all cope what's
(28:36) actually going on is that uh the women who are most often considered Pikmis or
(28:41) called Pikmis by these skanks are actually women who just have some kind of actual respect for men so they're not
(28:49) just [ __ ] objects for men instead there's some sort of uh uh mutual respect there or there's an opinion
(28:56) there which is valued remember that most women their opinion is never valued by
(29:01) anybody including other women it's just not valued at all there's a lot of
(29:07) emotional garbage that comes out of their mouth with each other validating each other things like this but most
(29:12) people don't seek out the opinions of women and so if it is the case that you have a woman who there's actual men who
(29:18) seek their opinions out or respect their opinions this is infuriating to the sisterhood they lose their minds
(29:25) collectively about this because how do they get attention they don't do it through they want to be valued for all
(29:31) the things that they're not valued for i want to be valued for my mind i want to be valued for my brains i want to be
(29:36) valued for the incredible things I say nope they're only valued because they got big tits and guys like to look at
(29:42) them that's it and they know it and because of that because of that they it
(29:47) it's an infuriating thing for them uh to see any sort of validation that comes to a woman from men that is something other
(29:54) than looks because that's all they've ever been validated for so uh this is uh
(30:00) this is kind of a a a big issue when you get into this uh this idea of the pickme
(30:05) parade now when you're talking about what do women want when it comes to men they want men who have high social
(30:10) status why because they don't they don't have high social status women don't have social status with men the same way that
(30:17) men have social status in society i don't give a [ __ ] about your career i don't care if you make millions of
(30:23) dollars i don't give a [ __ ] about any of that completely irrelevant to me when it comes to uh mate selection and 90% of
(30:31) men they don't give a [ __ ] about that your achievements are meaningless to them in that respect now are you a are
(30:37) you a great mother right are you gonna are you gonna give me back rub when I come home if I get super irritated for
(30:44) no particularly good reason right are you gonna come over and do that head scratchy thing with the long nails right
(30:51) are you going to do those things those are the things that we're looking for nobody gives a [ __ ] about your career
(30:56) but what's happened is women have tried now to compete with men in the career field they want to compete with them and
(31:03) it's like well if we're in competition I don't want to be in competition with my wife that sounds awful right i don't I
(31:09) don't want to do that that sounds terrible so when you're talking about validation I mean Myron's always been correct about this that the standards
(31:16) that women have for men way higher than the standards that men have for women
() 
(31:22) because men actually don't care and by the way we're the romantic sex not women explain that men are the romantic sex
(31:29) well it's Aren't the men the ones who show up with the boxes of chocolates and flowers aren't the men's the one the one
(31:35) who plant the dates aren't men the ones who come up with the great looks women will say "Aren't men the ones who do the
(31:41) men will say that they've trained you to do that and that that's not instinctual and that it's forced and that you know
(31:48) women kind of have to orchestrate or supervise or you know write down
(31:54) reminders to get you guys to do that stuff." Yeah too bad history disagrees with them look up courtly love courtly
(32:00) love true was popularized by a female queen that's true but this was a thing
(32:06) which was uh produced by male poets of the time a courtly love was a completely
(32:12) and chivalry itself came out of the mind of men where they've always been the romantic type uh winning over the woman
(32:20) the woman as the tro that's all courtly love stuff right all comes out of uh of
(32:25) that era and no we are the romantic sex always have been the romantic sex so the
(32:31) question is is what are women bringing to the table or are women the table that's the question let me ask you about
(32:37) this equality though because I I mean women don't want the responsibilities that men have you know in the same way
(32:43) they don't want to have to earn x amount of dollars a year they don't want to have to build the roads and bridges they
(32:49) don't want to have to they don't want they don't want the responsibilities of all those things so when they shout equality what are they what do they want
(32:56) what is that what is that thing is it just status is they're asking for status how does that translate to ask status
(33:01) manifest so so inside Yeah inside of a woman's brain at least the women the the
(33:07) many thousands I've talked to they think that sitting in a cubicle and crunching numbers or doing some other HR [ __ ]
(33:14) work or psychologizing on a couch is just as valuable to society as building a bridge they think it's just as
(33:20) valuable to society as welding they think it's just as valuable to society as war fighting they think it's just as
(33:25) valuable to society as the things that men are doing and it's not it's not and
(33:30) you can you can actually see this bear out what have women been about for 50 years the pay gap well is a pay why does
(33:36) the pay gap exist well because men are willing to work more overtime they're willing to do all if you compensate for it there's actually parity oh yeah
(33:43) inside of pay between men and women right the the main thing here is when you're talking about equality what they
(33:48) really want is they want to have the same social status absent the responsibility that's it that's what
(33:55) they mean by equality it's not equal the authority without responsibility argument essentially yeah it's always
(34:02) well and that's what they want status for status is always for authority right women wanting authority that's what
(34:07) abortion is about abortion is often about revenge against a man i can kill
(34:12) your kid i want the option to kill your kid if I want to kill your kid you've said something before about women
(34:18) knowing um you know guys will be drawn to a woman say she's got you know the
(34:23) big boobs and they're like they don't care about your career they don't care about any of that seems to me that women really do intrinsically know that though
(34:29) they do know it because what do they lead with right they lead with their sexuality they lead with you know they
(34:35) lead with that they weaponize it actually often times because they know that their power rests in their attractiveness their looks um their
(34:42) sexuality all of those things they don't lead with their where they put their boobs they put their boobs right
(34:49) stop looking stop stop sexualizing me they put their boobs right in your face stop it stop it stop looking they're not
(34:55) leading with their career they're not That's not And if they do talk about their career on the date they do it while the boobs are hanging out right so
(35:01) they know you you you've just heard like like they don't give a [ __ ] they know you don't give a [ __ ] but there's this
(35:08) odd disconnect somewhere um because they keep reaching for those very things that they know men don't care about while
(35:15) instinctively then kind of leaning on the things they do know men care about so they go out on the date and they talk about their job half naked right it's
(35:21) like this very strange disconnect that happens in a lot of these women it's not really that much of a disconnect imagine
(35:27) this so everything in your uh in your schooling from the time you're in first
(35:33) grade to the time you're through college you're being trained by women right women are the ones who are dominant in
(35:40) um in teaching roles and they're the ones who are dominant nursing roles things like this from the teaching role
(35:46) up what do they hear about they hear about women's empowerment they hear about the how uh men and women are
(35:52) interchangeable widgets how women have fought for their freedom right as though
(35:58) they were using musketss or something to do this um they that's what they that's what they hear about and so they do
(36:05) think I that there is a social status dynamic which uh they also adhere to
(36:12) inside of a hierarchy they think that that they're essentially inside of a man's hierarchy and they're competing
(36:18) within that hierarchy they're just not it's just a bunch of [ __ ] lies that they've been fed there is no competition
(36:25) with with women inside of the male hierarchy not when it comes to work or career men don't give a [ __ ] about it
(36:32) they don't care it's uh people ask me like why I do this why I do what I do and I think part of it was having a son
(36:38) right and realizing wow that the world is effed up you I need to I need to say
(36:43) my piece but also there was a lot of reflection i felt so lied to i grew up
(36:50) and in my ear the whole time was you need to go to college you need to get you know you need to prioritize this
(36:56) from everyone in my ear it was you know I I went to college and I graduated validictorian who gives a [ __ ] really i
(37:02) look back and I'm like what a waste of my time i was not intrinsically ambitious i did not want to work i was I
(37:10) wanted to look pretty i was an very objectively attractive young woman and I wanted to lay in the sun and look pretty
(37:16) and and and just be feminine and it was like you got to do this you got to pay your own bills you got to and it was so
(37:22) disruptive to my nervous system and my psyche but looking back I I'm like man I
(37:28) you know I got very lucky Andrew i I have an amazing husband i have an incredible child i got pregnant late
(37:35) very easily i this this God had a path for me and I thank him for it every
(37:40) single day but I still look back and I'm like what the hell was I doing i was not promiscuous i was just wasting time with
(37:48) stuff that I didn't give a lick about that didn't help me to feel healthier stronger so people always ask me what I
(37:53) you know why I do this and I'm like I'm really angry you know at all the people who wanted me to follow this male path
(38:00) so badly and it happens to so many women who aren't naturally that way they don't
(38:06) feel that I didn't feel this ambition or this desire to be a man or follow a man
(38:11) male path i didn't want to do any of it i didn't want to do an internship i didn't want to work that hard i didn't
(38:16) want any of it and still I spent a decade on [ __ ] essentially so I I'm
(38:22) like yelling at these women through the camera like listen to yourself you know and it's wild how well you're getting to
(38:29) the root of of something here which is most of the interexual dynamics that we
() 
(38:35) talk about are they're they're kind of tangential they actually don't get to the root of what our issue is the root
(38:43) of the issue revolves around one thing and one thing only it's the same thing it's always revolved around numbers and
(38:49) reproduction and it works this way it's real simple men have a duty to protect
(38:55) society and gather protect and refine resources and distribute them in the
(39:02) distribution of those resources to society women and children are the primary benefactors not men that's the
(39:09) case that's the higher duty the virtuous duty of men women's duty is supposed to be to reproduce what's happened is uh
(39:17) since feminism and its rise especially in the late 1800s to right now women
(39:23) have been sold a bill of goods their duty is not to reproduce that their duty is to do everything except reproduce you
(39:29) can do that later you can defer that you can fun you can blah blah blah but because the because men are still
(39:36) fulfilling that order of the social contract let's say and women are not fulfilling their end that's why you see
(39:43) this disconnect and they're they're hurting i'm telling you I have so many friends that did what I did and didn't
(39:49) get so lucky and they're they're devastated they look back at their life and they're like "What do I have to hold
(39:54) on to this this career who gives it who cares?" you know there's no children there's no
(40:01) essentially keep them warm at night they feel like they've lost purpose they've lost years i mean it's it's part of this
(40:06) content is I don't want women to wind up like that i I don't want that well you're talking about fulfillment so in
(40:14) in Christianity in in orthodoxy we call this teology or the tilos purpose you're
(40:20) talking about the purpose of men and women what is our ultimate purpose here
(40:26) and the truth is is you can just take it right to its rudimentary building blocks what does it take to build a society
(40:34) well the man and the woman have to have the sexy time for there to be the next generation right that's how it has to
(40:40) work you have to actually reproduce right now how do you end up with healthy families and healthy crossgenerational
(40:48) families and these kind of big dynamics where you had you know in some cases whole towns which were founded last name
(40:54) Jones you know it's like Jonestown you know things like this uh James Town Smith town it's because these families
(41:02) were so dynamic and crossgenerational and so large that they began to acrue a
(41:07) lot of wealth to themselves but the only way that that happens is if you have the what they call the traditional gender
(41:13) gender roles those not gender roles right this is this is how humanity actually has to operate uh within its
(41:20) building blocks or it can't function south Korea is not going to exist in 50 years i mean it's not actually going to
(41:27) exist their birth rate is under one it's at 0.9 last I checked it's I think the revised number is going to be 0.7
(41:34) that's a people whose demise is assured it's assured not through war not through
(41:40) attrition not through disease not through financially being crippled they have every advantage in the world
(41:47) they're going to be completely devastated because they flipped on gender roles the idea of gender roles
(41:54) the truth of the matter is is that you have to have building blocks for for for your society uh in general period and
(42:01) we've reversed them so we're screwed right that's it it's really that simple women defer uh family and they defer
(42:10) having children until later in life that's it it killed society it's killing society literally killing it and uh
(42:18) what's happened instead is we say "Well you should do what makes you feel good
(42:23) do what makes you feel good man if it makes you feel good to go 50 dudes in a
(42:28) weekend you go girl if it makes you if it makes you feel good dude to uh you
(42:34) know do a bunch of drugs and trip out on mushrooms on top of a mountain somewhere bro you can do that life's not about
(42:41) what makes you feel good and ultimately you uh you miss your purpose and this is
(42:47) what's happened is that the the purpose of men and women has been completely inverted i 100% agree i want to get to
(42:55) um Ben we're going to skip three if you're listening hopefully you are we're going to go to four
(43:01) so this is from just posting L's on Twitter and it's titled she should be loving life and this is a post he says
(43:08) "Am I the for telling my wife she's not a single parent just because I work long hours my wife 29 and I 31 have a
(43:16) three-year-old son i work 10 to 12 hour days as a contractor while she stays home lately she's been venting online
(43:23) and to friends saying she feels like a single mom because I'm never around i get that she's overwhelmed i am too but
(43:28) I'm working my ass off to keep us afloat the other night I heard her refer to herself as a solo parent during a Zoom
(43:33) call with her mom after she hung up I told her I didn't appreciate that I'm not partying i'm not neglecting our
(43:39) family i'm working she said I'm being defensive and that she feels like a single mom because she handles everything alone at home now I feel
(43:46) guilty i don't want to invalidate her but I also feel like she's ignoring everything I do am I the for calling her
(43:52) out so what I find and I'm going to have you respond to this guy but what I find most disturbing about these posts um
(43:58) when they cor crop up is that the guys are unsure like this guy has lost his
(44:04) way so much that he is unsure that he's doing the right thing this is a guy working long hours doing nothing wrong
(44:10) objectively just based on what he's saying here obviously we don't know if there's an extended story but he feels the need to say "Wait a minute am I
(44:17) doing something wrong do I also need to be doing X Y and Z am I am I failing my
(44:22) woman in some way what do you say to men like this that you've you've fallen for the great
(44:30) feminist trick of fairness right all that what she's talking about is not fair this isn't fair you're working you
(44:37) get to get out of the house and I have to stand here with a kid it's not fair tell her to shut her mouth literally
(44:43) tell her those words one of the biggest This is the biggest uh thing in society that that irritates me it's perfectly
(44:49) acceptable to tell women to shut the up per not only is it perfectly acceptable but you should pe more men should do it
(44:56) especially husbands they should look at their obnoxious wives when they're being obnoxious and tell them just like you
(45:01) would a man you're being obnoxious shut your mouth and don't disrespect me in
(45:06) public ever never it's not for you to do now inside what happens when men hear
(45:12) this and what happens especially when women hear this that's abusive it's abusive guy it's abusive
(45:19) it's it's emotional abuse it's the truth of the matter is is that they
(45:24) have no problem talking ill about you to their friends to their family which is exactly what this chick did no problem
(45:31) doing the backbiting somehow there's a problem though if you tell them to shut their mouth and get in line and the thing is is like it's perfectly
(45:38) acceptable for you to do that and you should do that you should be like "Look you need to shut your mouth and do your
(45:43) job." The same thing your boss would tell you at work shut your mouth and do your job you know what happens when you
(45:49) complain as a tradesman oh they you say "I have too much on my plate." Your boss says "Well get a bigger plate." They
(45:56) don't care they don't care because it's the results that matter and it's the same thing here ultimately uh they live
(46:03) in the most comfortable airond conditioned awesome world ever there's never been a better time to be alive for
() 
(46:09) a woman right tell them to shut the up shut up and you know what you know it's
(46:16) funny 90% of the time they actually respond pretty well to that well yeah because it's they actually respond pretty well to the decisiveness of you
(46:23) saying "Shut your mouth." Because it's also a guy who has self-respect who doesn't give a lick if she gets "Oh but
(46:29) you're doing you know who doesn't care about the rant um and who isn't afraid to be a man right?" So there's a a part
(46:35) of women that really do want to be led and do want the man of the house to act like the man of the house and they'll
(46:41) you know we will test you we will test you and see this is just natural what we do we test you we we push the envelope
(46:47) and then there's either going to be the guy that caves that then gets completely emasculated we lose respect for we lose
(46:52) attraction for the whole power dynamic falls apart or the guy that says "I'm not taking your [ __ ] right point blank."
(46:58) And interesting she doesn't find it abusive that she's back talking well let's reverse it let's say for a second
(47:04) that uh you were living with your brother or a friend and he was living
(47:10) there rentree right and you provided for his entire life and all he had to do was
(47:17) uh watch your kid during the day while you worked if he started complaining about that what would you say to him you
(47:23) would say you would say get the you would say no you'd say get the out if you don't like it right you say you
(47:28) wouldn't just say shut up you'd say shut the up and get the out so the thing is is why are you taking that [ __ ] from her
(47:36) because she's a woman oh well Andrew and women have to be dealt with in a very partic Well all of that is a way that's
(47:43) a way that women hide from accountability and responsibility they tell they literally tell you talked
(47:49) about Yeah they literally tell you "Wait a second Andrew uh wait a second that's not fair you have to deal." So what what
(47:56) women are actually doing is saying "I'm inferior to you a man." Right when a woman says that I'm inferior to you and
(48:03) I need to be spoken to in a certain way where it where you acknowledge that I'm inferior to you present it to her like
(48:09) that and you know what she'll say no I'm not inferior to you and you can say great then shut the up that takes us back to the original conversation that I
(48:16) had with you when I asked about that debate strategy and handling women and men differently because when you saw Hillary Clinton on that debate stage
(48:22) that's exactly what she did she weaponized that she was like "Oh every every time she was checked you know fact
(48:28) checked it was I'm you know oh I'm I'm being you know brutalized you're a misogynist this is sexism." All of that
(48:34) stuff um essentially and the bottom line is you got to just Good be a misogynist
(48:40) and be sexist you got to just You can't you can't cater to that crap is is the bottom line well the the Well actually
(48:46) it's even worse because the claims of misogyny it's Schroinger's feminist played out right i'm the most badass
(48:53) empowered woman ever or I'm the biggest victim who's ever existed whichever one
(48:58) gives me the most benefit at the time subject at the moment as well so the thing is is when when they say well you
(49:05) know I'm a victim here i'm a victim oh but at the same time I'm super empowered it's you got to you got to pick a lane
(49:12) you got to pick a lane i want to get to this one by um Rich Cooper we have two more um let's go to number five we're
(49:19) going to play the video the text above it says "Men women like this that don't have genuine burning desire for you will
(49:25) just use you to mock for Tik Tok clout don't waste your time." But let's check out the video
(49:32) so me and the guy went on six dates and after sixth date he told me that if
(49:37) we're not going home together we won't be seeing each other anymore
(49:43) i told him "Okay well wait in the car i'm going to go up and clean up i'll call you when I'm ready." Literally I
(49:50) went home showered and went to bed like what the hell is this ultimatum about who is going to go for that Andrew well
(49:56) I mean I would need um some more you know kind of like back details on the I
(50:02) don't think there's anything wrong with a woman wanting to keep her chassity intact if it is the case that she's one
(50:08) of these u kind of chased women i think Do you suspect that she would be one of those chased women i'm just you know I
(50:14) suspect that she is not okay so let's assume I hear your point because I'm also all for women you know saving you
(50:21) know their sanctity shall we speak um let's let's just let's assume that's not
(50:27) the case because 99.999% of the time it's not um what what is
(50:33) really going on here cuz to me this this is a pattern as well of women who I always tell guys she needs to be attracted to you from second one she
(50:39) needs to want you to jump her bones from second one that's like the the basis of the power dynamic as being established
(50:45) as I see it but um this is very common that guys will repeatedly go on dates
(50:50) with women who clearly aren't attracted to them and then this is how it goes down how do guys not get into this
(50:57) predicament how do you how do guys feel this out to know like hey this is a woman that doesn't really give a [ __ ]
(51:02) about me she's not attracted to me this isn't going anywhere this is a waste of my time my money my energy my effort
(51:08) what are the signs here can you advise at all well the thing is is um I've been out of
(51:14) the dating market for years and years and years and I don't think I would do
(51:19) very well uh inside of it and the reason I don't think I would do very well is because I just don't think I would do it
(51:24) i just think I think that if my wife died tomorrow let's say that I would just be happily alone basically for the
(51:31) rest of my life um but that's me right i'm kind of uh introverted this way but
(51:36) I'm not really a dating advice guy that's not uh it's not a thing I really uh dive into what I can say is this if
(51:43) it is the case that this woman let's just give her the benefit of the doubt was engaging in this because she wanted to stay chased and she wasn't interested
(51:50) in just going back home and screwing some guy I think that that's fine but chances are actually pretty good that
(51:55) she's probably ridden the carousel like you say and um and this this guy
(52:03) basically is saying "Look uh I want to see where if if you know basically I'm going to I'm going to put in an
(52:08) ultimatum either either we're finally going to seal the deal here or you're just continuously wasting my time." Now
(52:15) if you ask this important question how could you kind of [ __ ] test a woman to find out if she's interested in you that
(52:20) seems like it would be a perfectly acceptable [ __ ] test to see if she's interested in you right if she really was I don't think that she's going to
(52:26) turn you down by the situation and it's very obvious too when women are interested in men if you have to ask or
(52:32) if you have to wonder she's not because they're very um willing shall we say especially in this day and age the vast
(52:39) majority of them are very willing to get physical to do the extra flirting there's signs there's there's just signs
() 
(52:45) that are very obvious so if you're if you are on the fence I always tell guys if you're on the fence like does she does she is she into me and it's date
(52:51) six and she hasn't given you so much as a peck move on you know move on all right I want to close brian over at um
(52:58) your friend over at whatever podcast put this post up i think you this may have been the one you were referencing earlier it may not be i want to play
(53:05) this video um to close out i found it vomit inducing honestly but it important
(53:11) to watch nonetheless and this relates a little bit to the conversation we had about a woman's past let's close out
(53:16) with this last one number six my boyfriend has a very big issue with
(53:22) my past he found my list of people I have been with and he was pissed he
(53:28) actually broke up with me initially but after a while we got back together the issue now is I feel like he is
(53:34) constantly making judgmental comments about me being easy or having a high body count he always says he's just
(53:40) kidding but how can I get him to stop caring that I was with guys before him i feel like every single girl has a list
(53:47) of the guys she's ever been with like how fun i remember the men that have been inside of me and I have a husband
(53:54) and that's okay this sounds like a really insecure or possessive man we've
(53:59) all lived we've all had a good time and if anything everyone we've been with prior to has helped us become the person
(54:05) we are today i think your answer next time he says that if you were just being caddyy is like "What's your point
(54:12) i was so easy what's your point do you not want to be with me anymore he's like "Well no i'm just saying like I'm really
(54:18) shocked like how easy you were." What's your point what's your point are you trying to put
(54:23) me down right now or do you want me to get upset do you want me to defend myself like you let me know what what's
(54:30) your point what do you want me to do you want me to leave you want me to call them do you want me to detail everyone
(54:36) for you do you want me to pretend you're the first person I've ever had sex with like what do you want what will make you feel better you little
(54:45) boy okay so she's lovely i'm sure you know every guy's just jumping to hop on
(54:50) that train but you know bottom line is this guy's not going to get over it i think his point is that he probably in
(54:56) this case and obviously we don't have the backstory that guy probably thought he was get involved with somebody different right he was probably taken
(55:02) aback the list seems to have been uh quite long especially if you're using the word easy he's not going to get over
(55:07) it um he's not going to be able to stop thinking about it period it sounds like what's interesting to me though is this
(55:14) very typical argument that comes out which is that this is the sign or the
(55:20) marking of an insecure man men who don't like this who can't get over it who can't honestly celebrate the fact that
(55:25) I've had all these men inside me before them are insecure can you just take that on to close interesting um actually the
(55:35) it was the argument the setpiece argument came before that so the setpiece argument that she had was this
(55:41) she said "All that made me the woman I am today." That's actually what her
(55:48) argument is all of those experiences now she didn't say it like that she said it with rosecut glasses right all those
(55:55) various experiences with those men made me the woman that I am today and that's the woman you love right basically what
(56:01) she's saying is absent all that you wouldn't have even liked me right i needed to have all of that or else I
(56:07) couldn't possibly be this woman who you desire in front of you here today that's
(56:13) actually the cornerstone of her argument she moves on to say "Okay this is an insecurity because you have boundaries."
(56:20) And often times this is the case with almost every human being on planet Earth if they're upset by your boundaries they
(56:26) will push that you're insecure in some way because you have them and women are notorious for doing this because they
(56:31) like to push your boundaries right and one way to push your boundaries is by saying that you're insecure oh that
(56:36) you're just insecure you know if you if you were a more secure person you A B C D wouldn't bother you right this is a
(56:43) way to again defer accountability responsibility though they're not the only ones who do it men do it too women are just more notorious for it but what
(56:49) this reminds me of is an old meme that's good enough to come in Anon but you
(56:55) don't want to take it home to mommy and the thing is is that a lot of these women that's actually what it's become
(57:01) it's become a look it's fine for you to go and use their body right but you
(57:07) don't want to settle down with any of them and the thing is with her she's basically actually making the claim that
(57:12) that's good she's actually telling you that it's good for you guys to do that she's saying "Go find women like her
(57:19) dump your lonome and move on because that's what makes them the women they are today for their man." That's the
(57:26) actual logical argument from this femoid do you think it's real though do you think she actually in her heart of
(57:32) hearts believes that or is that justification for bad behavior to excuse no I believe 100 I believe 100% that in
(57:40) her brain she 100% excuses any past behavior that she's ever had because
(57:46) that's what makes her the person she is today and after all you're in love with
(57:52) that person you you do you think you would have loved me after the 50s I took
(57:57) if I hadn't had all that yeah or not just bored but uh you you
(58:03) need my baggage you need all of my insecurities that come with it you need all of my comparisons which come with it
(58:09) right you need that because that's the package deal which is going to be helpful to you and it's like who
(58:15) believes this [ __ ] well there's a lot of men who believe this [ __ ] and there's even more women who believe this and so
(58:22) that's what my capacity is my entire job is to get in at the logic and destroy these feminists at their root by showing
(58:29) just how absurd the things are that they say if I Now if I was in the room with this chick I would just ask her "Would
(58:35) your husband not love you if it were the case that you married him when you were
(58:40) a virgin?" And I think honestly that she would say "No I don't think he would." So then your husband wanted you
(58:46) certified pre and she would say and suddenly it clicks in their head right
(58:52) like "Oh [ __ ] oh [ __ ] that sounds [ __ ] when I say it out." Yes it does
(58:57) doesn't it sounds kind of [ __ ] doesn't it oh man well on that note
