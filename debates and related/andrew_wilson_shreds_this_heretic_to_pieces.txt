(0:00) i guess I have just a question for
(0:03) Andrew
(0:05) um makes me kind of nervous though the
(0:07) aggression um so my question is I guess
(0:10) about like you are a Christian do you do
(0:14) you claim that
(0:17) yeah I'm a baptized Eastern Orthodox
(0:19) Christian correct okay so I guess I was
(0:21) just wondering about um your use of cuss
(0:25) words and like telling people like [ __ ]
(0:28) and [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] yeah like that
(0:32) yeah those cuss words
(0:34) yeah do do you uh do you think that that
(0:37) Let me let me just um I'll just kind of
(0:39) cut to the chase really quick yeah let's
(0:41) hear it do you think that you're fooling
(0:43) God when you say
(0:45) shoot or darn it do you think that God's
(0:49) stupid do you think God's [ __ ] that
(0:51) when you go darn it he doesn't know what
(0:53) you mean or when he go freick do you
(0:56) think he doesn't know well are you
(0:59) fooling him are you fooling him are you
(1:01) like a God ear muffs God ear muffs no I
(1:05) don't think that's how God sees it if
(1:06) you try to change things I think God
(1:08) sees that you're trying to do
(1:10) something that you know to follow his
(1:13) way yeah so you understand these are
(1:16) these are social taboss not biblical
(1:18) taboos they're social taboos the word
(1:21) just so you understand it's not just the
(1:22) cursing i didn't get I didn't get to
(1:24) finish it's I guess too the way that um
(1:26) cuz remember we're representations of
(1:28) Christ we're kind of like his attorney
(1:29) we're God's council here on earth split
(1:32) do you just feel that the way that you
(1:36) come at people even people who are
(1:37) non-Christians do you think that that's
(1:40) how Jesus would do it or do you not
(1:41) believe in Jesus either how should I uh
(1:44) go go about things that would make you
(1:46) happy it's not about I'm just asking
(1:48) from a Christian who is I'm asking you
(1:51) as a Christian since you're concerned
(1:52) with the way that I approach people with
(1:54) the correct tone even though Christ was
(1:57) literally making corded whips and
(1:59) running people out of uh temples i
(2:02) clearly my tone is way off i would like
(2:04) for you instead of telling me do how I
(2:07) how do you feel about AB and C obviously
(2:10) I'm wrong tell me what I need to do to
(2:13) make you happy what can I do for you
(2:15) well it's not to make me happy i just
(2:17) something I've noticed is if people
(2:19) watching the show think that that's how
(2:21) a Christian would treat somebody
(2:22) especially it just comes off very mean
(2:25) and judgmental and I'm not saying we're
(2:27) not to judge righteously in the church
(2:29) we are but I've just seen you cussing
(2:31) and like saying shut the f up if Jesus
(2:34) were to be here that's not how Jesus
(2:36) would talk to you've never seen me say
(2:38) shut the f up on this show yeah that was
(2:40) me i
(2:41) mean it's a lot of cussing and it's and
(2:44) you do kind of you know you are a
(2:45) debater and I get it but I just from a
(2:48) Christian I say some socially taboo
(2:50) words that you don't like do they no it
(2:52) has nothing about what I don't like it
(2:53) has to do with God's nature but I know
(2:55) you don't believe in the Bible now so
(2:56) that makes more sense what does God's
(2:58) nature say about your tattoo uh I got
(3:00) these before I was a Christian oh okay
(3:02) so as long as I swore it before I was a
(3:04) Christian that would make it fine yeah
(3:05) cuz once you're born again you have to
(3:07) be born again okay okay so then why
(3:09) don't you cover the tattoo up because I
(3:11) was born again i was forgiven yeah but
(3:13) why don't you cover it up but because if
(3:15) I covered it up then that's me saying
(3:17) that I'm not born again that I wasn't
(3:19) forgiven so I'm not going to lie to God
(3:20) about my nature right because I say the
(3:23) f- word i'm just saying scripture tells
(3:26) us how to act and it perverts cuss words
(3:29) then tell me how I should act what
(3:31) should I do well how should I change my
(3:33) tone to make you happy it's not to make
(3:36) me happy it would be to make God happy
(3:38) not okay i mean as a Can we open up i
(3:41) would like I glad that you brought this
(3:43) up because I'd like to do a social
(3:45) experiment with you if you don't mind uh
(3:48) just a very quick social experiment
(3:50) christian to Christian uh if if we were
(3:53) to return your cell phone I would like
(3:55) to open up our DMs and go DM for DM and
(3:59) see how many DMs you've gotten from
(4:01) people who are thanking you for bringing
(4:03) them to Christ and how verse how many
(4:05) people thank me do it are you ready yeah
(4:07) let's do it okay great let's do it she
(4:10) got her phone
(4:12) yeah I grabbed it last time you first i
(4:15) am going here I'll let someone else read
(4:17) through it too
(4:19) just don't read the one with 2K baby
(4:21) mama okay someone want to go through it
(4:24) yeah let's go through it i don't think
(4:26) you can show on i can't show okay just
(4:29) read it out yeah just read them go to my
(4:33) like message requests and stuff
(4:37) where am I going go to messenger
(4:39) glassears okay
(4:42) thank you for your Christian post
(4:45) that prayer is almost as beautiful as
(4:47) dot dot dot i'm not going to click on
(4:48) them i'm just going to scroll through
(4:50) see what I see that has to do with God
(4:52) no no no how many people have converted
(4:54) to Christianity well you haven't
(4:56) converted anybody i haven't jesus does
(4:59) that yeah you can't you can't convert
(5:02) anybody or save anybody you can Okay
(5:04) well how many people whose words your
(5:06) words have reached who have thanked you
(5:08) for converting them that's my question
(5:10) if how people are thanking you for
(5:13) converting them no they're thanking me
(5:15) for hearing the words that's it
(5:18) i mean it's a lot she can they're
(5:20) worshiping him and it's not about you
(5:23) know I'm just Oh okay so how many
(5:27) Okay I'm not even gonna lie she's got a
(5:29) lot but of people who say "I came to
(5:31) Christ because of you." one video uh
(5:34) over 4 million a million um over a
(5:38) million people
(5:42) viewing you've converted you so no you I
(5:44) haven't converted anybody cuz I'm not
(5:46) Jesus and I'm not yelling at people
(5:48) either to do it yeah so I just want to
(5:50) make sure I got this right according to
(5:53) you over a million people have come to
(5:55) Christ because of you that's not what I
(5:57) said that's not what I said because your
(5:59) words reached him no that's not what I
(6:01) said You made that up i said a million
(6:03) people have viewed just this video 4
(6:06) million on this video i have a reach and
(6:08) it helps people but it plants a seed
(6:10) because I'm not Jesus and I don't tell
(6:12) people to follow me and I'm not saving
(6:14) anybody and neither are you i didn't say
(6:16) I was i'm saying that people reach out
(6:18) who said that they've heard my words
(6:20) that's all I'm saying
(6:23) well I'm not sure i assume I assume that
(6:25) you're using the word and your words to
(6:29) reach people yes
(6:31) okay great so then if they hear your
(6:34) words and they would not have ordinarily
(6:36) have heard anybody else's words and your
(6:38) words are convincing to them and they
(6:40) they would probably notify you or let
(6:42) you know they have okay great how many
(6:46) of them i I wasn't counting but I I was
(6:50) scrolling and there was she had a lot of
(6:52) DMs i'm not even going to lie about
(6:54) people saying "Thank you for your
(6:55) message you've changed my life." All
(6:57) over the world mhm all over the world
(6:59) millions and millions right hundreds of
(7:01) or thousands and thousands or tens of
(7:04) thousands i mean does it matter who did
(7:06) more how many i'm just wondering how
(7:08) many do you think i mean over time I
(7:11) don't know how many do you think
(7:15) well so see so here's the So here's the
(7:17) difference right i would never ever ever
(7:21) in a million [ __ ] years ever tell
(7:24) anybody that information how many people
(7:27) have been converted because of me how
(7:29) many people send me those DMs how many
(7:32) people are asking no one has been
(7:33) converted stop let me finish let me
(7:35) finish because this is just a bunch of
(7:37) virtue signaling [ __ ] it's a bunch
(7:40) of virtue signaling [ __ ] and I don't
(7:43) [ __ ] care if you don't like my tone i
(7:46) don't give a [ __ ] i don't care well for
(7:48) you know anyone watching I would just
(7:50) hope you know that you know if you love
(7:53) God uh Christians don't act like that
(7:55) and they they Nobody cares what heretics
(7:57) have to say you're a heretics who cares
(8:00) what denomination are you in heresy i'm
(8:01) nonomination which heresy which heresy
(8:04) denomination are you from you just like
(8:05) to hear yourself talk and you just say
(8:07) different things which heresy
(8:08) denomination are you from i'm not in a
(8:10) denomination you're non-denominational
(8:12) you're non-denominational
(8:15) is that funny
(8:18) yeah i think it's funny yeah okay
(8:23) i think it's sad that you represent all
(8:25) of you for all of you who are listening
(8:26) out there for all of you who are
(8:28) listening to [ __ ] heretics who tell
(8:31) you that you can fool God and he's not
(8:34) going to actually know that you said
(8:35) [ __ ] when you said frick but you're just
(8:37) saying that i don't say that big brained
(8:40) [ __ ] Protestant over here big brain
(8:42) you can fool God by saying frick we are
(8:45) to be Jesus's representation on earth so
(8:48) that people who are non-believers can
(8:50) see the way that you act teach on earth
(8:51) you're not to teach you're to sit there
(8:53) and be silent on earth it's when people
(8:55) observe you okay well you don't believe
(8:57) the Bible holy looking woman looking bad
(8:59) i don't believe the Bible what does Paul
(9:01) said tonight what does Paul say about
(9:03) women teaching what does he say says
(9:05) that they are to not teach in the church
(9:06) and to listen to men on and you're not
(9:08) to correct men are you but it's not to
(9:11) assume authority and I don't teach
(9:12) you're not to correct men are you well I
(9:15) can correct you cuz I wouldn't call you
(9:16) a Christian not to correct men are you i
(9:20) mean my husband yeah so your husband he
(9:24) could come to me and correct me you're
(9:26) not to correct men are you
(9:29) no then stop trying to correct me i
(9:31) meant no i am not trying to correct men
(9:34) stop no on this podcast they got even
(9:38) the women looking bad listen can I ask
(9:40) you spirit would you act Do you act like
(9:42) this all the women looking bad christian
(9:44) you could be a whole Christian
(9:46) personally don't but I personally don't
(9:48) i believe he makes a valid point when he
(9:50) brings up this i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm
(9:52) sorry
(9:52) did you just appeal to somebody else to
(9:54) make your argument for you you just got
(9:56) done saying it's not for you to correct
(9:58) men and yet you when I said then stop
(10:00) correcting men you said no you have
(10:02) what's called a willful spirit no what
(10:04) you have is you're actually misplacing
(10:06) conviction from God and your place is
(10:08) I'm judging you oh yeah did God convict
(10:11) you to correct me yeah he did he did so
(10:15) God's going against his own teachings
(10:20) i don't know i guess uh I'm not sure i
(10:24) just don't believe in that that's not
(10:26) what it says you're twisting scriptures
(10:28) and because you talk fast and you yell
(10:30) at me talking fast and I'm not yelling
(10:34) you were saying I am not supposed to
(10:36) teach a man i'm not teaching you
(10:38) anything i'm telling you i'm telling you
(10:41) it's an open It's almost like an open
(10:42) rebuke when what when someone is sinning
(10:44) or doing something you would go to them
(10:46) in the
(10:46) church before eventually kicking them
(10:49) out but obviously I can't kick you out
(10:50) but I'm just telling you as a Christian
(10:52) yeah you can't it's not for you it's
(10:53) really not for you you can't correct me
(10:55) i would say for people that watch you
(10:58) and they think that that's like how a
(11:00) Christian should act i would just say I
(11:01) disagree well that's great i would just
(11:04) say that I disagree i think that if
(11:06) anybody's so [ __ ] stupid that they
(11:09) think that when she says prick she's
(11:11) fooling God she's she's You keep saying
(11:14) that i don't say he doesn't know he
(11:16) doesn't know what she means right
(11:19) anything you say in Lou what you're
(11:21) doing is you're actually making a
(11:22) conflation i've tried to I've tried to
(11:24) explain this to people before it's
(11:25) impossible to do with women because you
(11:28) guys operate off of pure feelings you
(11:30) think you think that your emotional
(11:32) state is what makes you a Christian
(11:34) that's why you you guys are all heretics
(11:36) it's insane the non-denominationals are
(11:38) the worst so that you understand a
(11:41) social taboo saying the word [ __ ] is a
(11:46) social taboo it is not listen this is
(11:50) stated it's st over and over again these
(11:53) are social taboss you not cussing
(11:56) doesn't make you a good Christian
(12:00) do you have Bible scriptures for that
(12:02) though and I'm not going to get into it
(12:03) but I'm just saying can we get a final
(12:06) point from the each of each of you final
(12:08) final point on that i got let a couple
(12:10) Yeah listen so here's my final point no
(12:13) you're not fooling the abundance of the
(12:15) heart that's all I You're not fooling
(12:16) God when you say "Oh I don't use these
(12:19) socially constructed words which are in
(12:21) no way taboo in other nations." So let
(12:24) me ask a question a real quick question
(12:26) mhm if in China the word [ __ ] was not a
(12:30) social taboo is it okay for the Chinese
(12:33) to say it if they're Christians or can
(12:36) just the word [ __ ] is just non-Christian
(12:39) just saying it is not what Christian the
(12:41) perverse meaning behind it
(12:44) it's the meaning behind it word
(12:47) god okay so it's so it's a socially
(12:50) constructed meaning right but if we know
(12:53) that God knows that and I'm just saying
(12:54) God knows our hearts and he tells us
(12:56) what we speak from our mouth comes from
(12:58) the abundance of our heart so when we
(13:00) say what things that we know to be
(13:02) wicked words he would know that so if I
(13:05) say the word [ __ ] I you think that I
(13:07) actually mean excrement off of the
(13:09) ground like if I snub my nose and I go
(13:11) "Oh shit." Is that Do you think that
(13:14) there's evil meaning in my heart i think
(13:16) when you were talking to me answer my
(13:18) question please it's just so irrelevant
(13:21) to what I'm telling you though and
(13:22) answer my question please if I snub my
(13:25) toe and I say [ __ ] is the meaning in my
(13:29) heart malicious and evil
(13:32) final thought from I don't know how to
(13:34) answer him because he's just saying
(13:35) something totally different they've been
(13:36) doing this the whole podcast doesn't
(13:38) make sense final thought Andrew final
(13:39) thought on that yeah you don't
(13:41) understand cuz you never [ __ ] thought
(13:42) about it for 5 seconds that's what
(13:44) drives me no you just twist stuff you
(13:46) twist you never thought about any of
(13:47) these concepts for even 5 seconds it
(13:50) drives me it drives me berserk because
(13:52) I've actually taken the time to sit down
(13:54) and talk to clergy and so you think that
(13:57) Jesus actual clergy about how this
(14:00) operates that's insane oh oh damn insane
(14:03) that's not how Jesus would act it's
(14:05) insane it What's insane i'm also you
(14:08) Okay I am much younger and I've not been
(14:10) a Christian for a long time but even I
(14:12) can tell someone as advanced as you are
(14:13) probably in the church that should know
(14:15) God and his nature the fact the way that
(14:17) you do talk to girls and stuff it's
(14:19) insane
(14:21) like you're held to a higher standard i
(14:23) mean it's just not it's insane yeah well
(14:25) great i'm sure no one's ever said this
(14:26) to you before look at what you
(14:27) Protestants have done you Protestants
(14:29) did a great job stopping all this
(14:31) prostitution and abortion and everything
(14:33) in society with your [ __ ] tone
(14:36) policing haven't you you haven't
(14:37) accomplished [ __ ] you're calling me a
(14:40) Society is the most decent it's ever
(14:42) been thanks to you Protestants thank you
(14:45) thank you for being nice to them while
(14:47) they [ __ ] destroy the world thank you
(14:50) very kind of you to tone police
(14:51) everybody very kind it's worked out real
(14:54) well right prostitution's way down isn't
(14:56) it decadence way down isn't it thank you
(14:59) you're going
(15:02) great job Protestants i don't know why
(15:04) you just keep calling me a Protestant i
(15:05) mean I'm You're non-denominational right
(15:07) you're the non-denominational Protestant
(15:10) what do you want me to say i'm not you
(15:12) know involved with any of that i just
(15:14) take care of my you know own faith but
(15:16) you're on here telling girls about your
(15:18) relationship with God and it's just
(15:20) frustrating was it your made it up faith
(15:23) my made it up faith yeah is it your made
(15:25) Is it your made it up faith or is there
(15:27) some church authority that you're under
(15:30) i don't know i was just trying to tell
(15:31) you that you're not listening to me see
(15:33) you twist things and that's what you All
(15:36) I was trying to tell you and I wish you
(15:37) would just let me say it in one sentence
(15:39) one sentence i do not think it's a good
(15:42) representation if you claim to be a
(15:43) follower of Christ to be cussing and
(15:45) swearing at people and acting Oh I'm
(15:47) sorry I interrupted your chastisement
(15:49) i'm sorry my bad sorry I interrupted you
(15:52) while you were upset and wanted to
(15:53) chastise me publicly because you didn't
(15:55) want to say things it's the way that you
(15:57) reacted and you're you just flipped it
(15:59) and attacked me
(16:02) yeah i mean I I tend to mock when people
(16:05) say stupid [ __ ] i tend to mock the
(16:07) stupid [ __ ] god's word is not stupid
(16:09) the words you're saying are stupid they
(16:11) don't even make sense when I ask you
(16:12) basic questions you flounder basically
(16:14) because you're asking me questions that
(16:16) are not even relevant you're talking
(16:17) about dog poop they are relevant
(16:22) the scriptures say no perverse language
(16:24) should come from your lips yeah but what
(16:26) does that mean and that the way that we
(16:27) act should be a representation of Christ
(16:31) to help yeah what does perverse mean
(16:33) though what does that mean perverse
(16:35) language what does that mean what is the
(16:37) meaning behind that perverse language
(16:39) means
(16:43) I don't know how to explain it it means
(16:44) just you don't know yeah you don't know
(16:46) you That's my whole point that's why I
(16:48) brought up the snubbing your nose and
(16:50) saying is that perverse cuz I don't
(16:52) think it's perverse perverse language
(16:55) means it has a bad dark intention but
(16:58) you human use for sexual or evil hate
(17:02) malice
(17:04) that would be perverse so perverse would
(17:07) mean that there's intent behind whatever
(17:09) it is right the intent is what matters
(17:12) right right okay so you can't read my
(17:15) heart so if I say the word [ __ ] it why
(17:18) is the intent evil or malicious or
(17:21) perverse except how
(17:25) explain it to me you're missing what I'm
(17:26) saying i'm saying that when you are
(17:29) representing Jesus what makes you
(17:32) different than just someone who's out in
(17:34) the street saying "F you f you f this."
(17:36) I mean I'm just saying it's because
(17:38) intent intent is what is the perverse
(17:42) that is what is perverse can for
(17:44) instance okay have you ever heard in the
(17:47) south they do a lot of things like um
(17:51) they might say "Oh it's colder than a
(17:55) witch's tit." Have you ever heard that
(17:57) no you never heard that have you ever
(18:00) heard Oh it's Hang on hang on uh it's so
(18:03) cold outside there's icicles hanging off
(18:06) the devil's balls have you ever heard
(18:08) that no no okay these are common phrases
(18:12) common saying especially down south
(18:14) right are they Are they evil perverse
(18:17) people for saying those things for
(18:18) saying it's colder than a witch's tit
(18:22) are they evil is that perverse
(18:28) could it be perverted yeah what I Is it
(18:30) perverse to just say it
(18:34) i mean it depends how far you are in
(18:37) Christ but someone like you yeah I would
(18:38) expect more that's all I'm saying okay
(18:40) is it perverse to say it or not
(18:44) okay to be honest I wasn't listening it
(18:46) does it does have to be final word from
(18:48) each you're just like you won't answer
(18:49) the question you do everything but
(18:51) answer the question ask me the question
(18:53) no ask No ask me a question cuz I wasn't
(18:55) listening i tuned you out because you're
(18:56) arguing because I told you my opinion
(18:58) and you just started going on and on and
(19:00) on and you've just lost me ask your
(19:02) question one sentence that I have lost
(19:04) you is it perverse to say it's colder
(19:06) than a witch's tit outside is that Yes
(19:08) it is yes it is yes it is and I And what
(19:10) makes it perverse because you're saying
(19:12) the word tit and you know what it
(19:14) represents and you're not stupid saying
(19:16) the word tit yeah and I think I do think
(19:18) it's perverse i do what about now if I
(19:21) said it's colder than a witch's nipple
(19:24) out that's perverted i would expect a
(19:27) leave those dumb young kid to say
(19:29) something like that not a grown man who
(19:30) says that he follows Christ and he's
(19:32) trying to teach people or lead them
(19:33) bring the witch nipples into this now
(19:35) now what if they said you colder than
(19:38) hell outside colder than a witch's
(19:40) breath colder than hell that's just kind
(19:42) of a stupid thing to say it's not
(19:45) perverse it's not perverted see perverse
(19:47) comes from perverted yeah yeah what's
(19:49) What's So what's not perverse about
(19:52) invoking hell what the [ __ ] cuz you know
(19:55) it's not the same talking about hell
(19:57) jesus talks okay did Jesus talk No let
(20:00) me speak did Jesus talk about perverted
(20:02) things or did he talk about hell we can
(20:04) talk about hell i mean he's talked about
(20:06) hell yeah okay so why are you comparing
(20:08) it to perverted words that's just
(20:10) because I'm just I'm make I'm giving you
(20:11) an example of how absurd it is for you
(20:14) to take kind of these socially
(20:16) constructed taboss that you just don't
(20:18) like and trying to map the world reality
(20:22) of reality of sin somebody's saying it's
(20:25) colder than hell outside right it's
(20:28) that's not perverse lady it's the Bible
(20:31) saying it not me for some reason in your
(20:33) brain the Bible says it got no where
(20:36) where does the Bible say that that that
(20:38) No okay let's bring up the scriptures
(20:40) yeah let's do it bring it up bring up
(20:42) where it says that that is perverse to
(20:45) say it's colder than a witch's tip you
(20:47) know that because it's not specifically
(20:48) in there and that's why you have to have
(20:50) conviction from God because not every
(20:52) situation is in the Bible leave the
(20:53) witch nips
(20:55) can we just like play can we not talk
(20:56) about the witch nips all right
(20:59) wait I uh do you want to make a final
(21:01) thing Andrew we do got to I do want to
(21:03) try to wrap things up it's almost two
(21:05) yeah so anyway the whole point here is
(21:06) that the reason you can't answer any of
(21:08) these basic questions i did answer them
(21:10) you just didn't like it i said no and it
(21:11) is
(21:11) perverted because it hurts my feelings
(21:14) that's it they don't like your answer
(21:15) it's a fight exactly you said a whole
(21:17) bunch of nothing i gave you scriptures
(21:20) you gave no scriptures you just say "I
(21:21) confess and swear and do whatever I
(21:23) want." Listen I Here's the thing about
(21:26) God's nature the logos right god gave us
(21:30) logic logic and so the thing is is that
(21:33) if you say anything to me ever which is
(21:36) perverse to the nature of God and the
(21:38) logos and logic I'm going to dismiss it
(21:40) as being illogical because it's not of
(21:42) the nature of God do you understand yes
(21:45) but that's disrespectful to God because
(21:47) he would not cut that's disrespectful to
(21:49) God to obey his nature okay do you think
(21:51) you're obeying his nature by saying f
(21:53) you that's insane that doesn't That's
(21:56) crazy son that is crazy that's crazy i
(21:58) don't know i'm just I know he's joking
(21:59) but I'm just typing i'm just typing wait
(22:01) like uh I actually I want who's a
(22:03) non-Christian i I actually want to
(22:04) defend Andrew i want to defend Andrew
(22:06) here so I'm I'm uh I'm in my mid-30s
(22:10) right i'm in my mid-30s and I've been
(22:13) pretty much I would say like agnostic
(22:17) atheist for like pretty much most of my
(22:19) life right and like you know I've been
(22:23) exposed to you know some religious stuff
(22:25) here and there it's not because you're
(22:28) asking him how many people have has
(22:29) Andrew converted i'm not quite there yet
(22:34) but Andrew has made the most compelling
(22:39) uh case for
(22:42) religion that I've I've heard i'm I
(22:46) would you know sorry I'm tired i'm not
(22:48) really making sense right now but Andrew
(22:51) is like the
(22:53) closest person like who's pushed me more
(22:55) towards religion religion than anybody
(23:00) so I don't know just a shout out yeah
(23:02) but but you have to understand Brian
(23:05) that I didn't use the correct tone i
(23:08) never spoke about your tone i feel like
(23:11) I agree with a lot of things Andrew says
(23:13) especially on the religion topic topic
(23:15) but I do feel like this podcast is very
(23:17) much like I don't know it's like very um
(23:20) Wait did you just say you agree with a
(23:22) lot of what I say on the religious topic
(23:24) on on it negative it's kind of negative
(23:27) it may because what I say makes sense
(23:28) right it is i mean yeah i mean do you
(23:31) feel threatened yeah i mean it just
(23:33) makes sense gigantic cell phone yes that
(23:36) that definitely threw me off
(23:39) can I ask you are you convicted that
(23:41) what I'm saying is making sense um
(23:44) convicted yeah are you convicted i mean
(23:48) I'd have to listen to you talk more um
(23:50) yeah but it definitely makes sense right
(23:52) yeah I'm sure yeah and the thing is
(23:54) about the nature of of the logos and the
(23:57) nature of logic when people hear you
(23:59) speak and they hear what you're actually
(24:01) saying and they can logically deduce it
(24:04) from something other than because the
(24:06) Holy Spirit told you so it's far more
(24:10) compelling to people far more compelling
(24:14) that's just been my experience but then
(24:16) again I've debated with the largest
(24:18) atheists in the world i don't remember
(24:21) you ma'am ever doing anything of the
(24:23) sort here you go you are very offended i
(24:26) can tell
(24:28) sorry I did yeah I would never in a
(24:30) million years make the declar I would
(24:32) make declaration you're a heretic but I
(24:33) would never make a salvific claim or say
(24:35) something as absurd as you're not a
(24:36) Christian anyways guys I gotta I got to
(24:38) let the TTS's come
