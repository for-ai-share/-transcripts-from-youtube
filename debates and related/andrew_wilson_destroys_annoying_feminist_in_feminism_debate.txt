(0:00) would you agree if the if the god says to you you are now me you and I are now
(0:05) equal you just can't do all the things I can do right i'm going to make you a god just like me but you can do all the
(0:11) things that I can do except certain things that you can't are you equal with that person or are you not equal with
(0:18) that person or that entity
(0:24) i don't andrew Wilson is back to completely school this ignorant feminist
(0:30) Farha Khaledi in a feminist debate they had this debate on the Playing with Fire
(0:35) channel andrew Wilson does his best to make himself super clear and give super uh great examples however Farha just
(0:43) doesn't want to admit that feminism sucks let's see how this debate goes
(0:49) down yeah I guess you could let's start off with that and then we can move on to the next one when you guys are done with that so why don't you just give your
(0:54) opening thought on that and then we'll get into it yeah so women uh women can't
(1:00) make decisions about their own rights because they can't enforce their own rights so since they they have no
(1:05) enforcement mechanism other than men all their rights come from men so they can't actually be equal there's always going
(1:12) to be a differential and that's a necessary biological truth it's not saying that uh women can't be uh equal
(1:20) in the eyes of men as far as um you know you can't murder them abuse them things
(1:26) like this uh within the commons that you would do with men but there can't actually be egalitarianism it's not it's
(1:33) not even possible uh because women have no enforcement mechanism so since there's no enforcement mechanism there's
(1:39) there's there's just it's it's a laughably absurd idea doesn't have no enforcement mechanism
(1:46) because women's rights are legally created by men is that what you mean
(1:51) what do you mean well no they're enforced by men so if so in other words if men collectively tomorrow say you
(1:56) have no rights you don't have any anymore and there's nothing you can do about it there's nothing anybody any woman anywhere can do about it um that
(2:04) that's just the truth of the world uh if men collectively and and we do sometimes men do anyway i'm not I'm not grouping
(2:11) myself as a monolith but men do do this and in some nations they just say "Hey women don't have rights and they don't
(2:18) have rights and there's nothing that they can do about it." How would that happen in America where
(2:24) we do have democracy and we're not just led by I don't know men using their physical strength to dominate us like
(2:30) how could men tomorrow collectively say "You know what like half our population you no longer have rights well if men
(2:36) tomorrow say there's no democracy in America there's no democracy in America tomorrow either if men tomorrow say that
(2:41) we're going to have a communist nation tomorrow there will be a communist nation as well so if men as as far as a
(2:48) monolith go let's say you don't even need 50 100% but let's just say 30%
(2:53) something like this say we don't want democracy anymore there isn't going to be a democracy anymore they say they
(2:59) don't want communism there isn't going to be or they want communism that's what it'll be if they say they want socialism
(3:04) that's what it'll be so essentially men are the the holders of what society is
(3:09) going to look like what the economic status is going to be what everything is going to be because they're the enforcement mechanism
(3:15) okay so if that's true if men are the enforcement mechanism why does that then mean that women's equality is a bad idea
(3:21) well I didn't say it was a bad idea i mean it is but what what my position is
(3:27) is that it's laughable that egalitarianism is even possible because women have no way to enforce their
(3:32) rights they have to use men to enforce their rights so since they have to use men to enforce their rights they don't
(3:38) really have any rights because all their rights come from men guys one quick thing the whole chat is complaining i
(3:44) don't know which one of you guys is typing but the typing noise is really really loud uh I don't know if you can Yeah I hear it i hear it too i don't
(3:50) know if you can tone down the noise or just uh keep your computer a little bit far away from your phone it just a lot
(3:55) of people She's on a Hang on she's on a cell phone and I'm not typing so far are
(4:01) you using your computer to take notes yeah I'm on my I'm on my phone and computer but Oh okay maybe you can just
(4:07) uh like Yeah move your computer a little bit further from the phone so the audio doesn't come in okay okay continue
(4:16) oh that's that's the that's my position it's it's absurd to it's absurd to have
(4:21) any belief in egalitarianism on its face because uh it's not actually possible except through the graciousness of of
(4:28) men it's absurd to have egalitarianism because women cannot physically enforce
(4:34) their own rights you mean yeah yeah so egalitarianism is not it's not true it's
(4:39) not real it's false it's only possible through uh men in other words it's not
(4:44) possible through women women can't be equal unless men allow them to be equal which means it's paradoxical because
(4:53) um this means that they're never going to be equal because men are going to always be the arbiters of what that
(4:59) equality is because women can't enforce it so but why does the notion of
(5:05) egalitarianism have to be predicated on physical strength or like who gets to enforce it well what else could it be
(5:12) predicated on principles of like what's best for society and what happens if somebody
(5:18) violates those principles equally equal like why would it be based off the enforcement what happens if somebody
(5:24) violates those principles what do you mean well so if you have a society in which you have laws and
(5:30) government and things like this and whatever social social contracts you come up with what happens if one side
(5:36) violates those principles or a person or an individual or a group violates those principles what would you do with them
(5:43) you would well I I think arrest them maybe or uh punish them or do something
(5:48) punitive or put them in prison or something like that and so you're right back to the enforcement mechanism again
(5:54) so there's really no way around it the enforcement mechanism is from men will
(5:59) always be from men and so it's paradoxical to say that women can have equal rights because even if they do
(6:05) have equal rights it's just because men have allowed them to
(6:10) but does that make women's equality laughable or like an absurd idea well it's paradoxical on its face so it has
(6:15) to be laughable because there is never going to be such thing as women's equality just an illusion thereof
(6:21) because if it's decided by even a small minority majority of men minority
(6:26) majority being like 10 15 20% they just won't have it anymore and there's nothing they can do about it so uh
(6:33) essentially always they have to defer to men for this
(6:39) I guess would you apply the same logic to race like if someone's a racial minority and then a larger racial
(6:44) majority just decides like we're going to overpower you physically and with enforcement mechanisms nope it wouldn't
(6:50) work the same way it would just be the same man paradox so if men decided to take rights away from a single group of
(6:56) men they could do that yes but if let's say if it was a racial minority of women
(7:03) um or something like this that wanted to take away rights or even if it was a racial majority of women who wanted to
(7:08) take away rights from a minority of men they likely couldn't do it without using
(7:13) men as enforcement so it's always it always comes back to this no matter what so it'll be in this particular case if
(7:19) you're talking about race it would be yes groups of men can take away rights for whatever reason based on whatever
(7:25) proxy they have from other men and have always been able to do so okay i guess I
(7:30) just disagree that that makes women's equality laughable because we would need
(7:35) a Well then explain how you can be equal because I don't think equality is
(7:41) predicated on physical strength i don't think equality is necessarily predicated on whether you're able to enforce it
(7:47) yourself what's it predicated on what's a right predicated on where do you think
(7:52) a right comes from absent enforcement of the right
(7:58) i mean conservatives will argue that you know a lot of you know fetuses in the womb have rights even though they can't
(8:04) physically defend themselves that they're still worthy of human rights so what you're saying there for themselves
(8:10) so does that mean that like you know fetuses shouldn't be deserving of human rights if you are pro-life
(8:15) because women could just decide to just abort them like I just Well so this is this is this is question begging right
(8:22) so I'm asking you where do rights come from and you say well conservatives will say that uh children in the womb have
(8:28) rights well that may be true or maybe false but that doesn't actually answer my question which I'm asking you where
(8:34) do you think rights come from well I guess what I'm saying is where they don't come from is physical strength i don't care where they don't come from i
(8:40) want to know where they do come from where do they come from
(8:46) um I Well I mean it does come from physical strength i mean in that
(8:52) situation she has to bring up an unborn baby and the mother having power over it i mean in that situation the mother yes
(8:58) has power over the unborn baby which is why it's the job of the mother to
(9:03) protect the work baby because you do have power over it because you're bigger and stronger than it
(9:10) it's subjective like some people think it comes from just a religious sense of you're a person you're deserving of
(9:16) human rights you're deserving of prosperity and happiness or you could
(9:22) argue that I guess it depends what you think are fundamental rights like which right that's that's the question I'm
(9:27) asking you is if you don't have an explanation or grounding for why you think that people should have rights at
(9:33) all or where rights even come from then what else could they be other than an enforcement mechanism by groups of
(9:39) people for what they think other people should be allowed to do or not do i don't think because I don't have a
(9:44) clean definition of where rights come from that means that I have to just defer that rights should just come from
(9:50) who can physically enforce them where else could they come from then
(9:56) if there's no clean definition it means that tyranny is what dictates rights well no well in your case for democracy
(10:04) you might say it's a tyranny of majority or you could say uh that it's not a tyranny because it's the majority it
(10:10) wouldn't really matter which way you framed it the truth of the matter is though is that you have to at some some
(10:15) point contend with this issue which is if you don't think that there's a grounding for rights and they're just
(10:20) all subjective based on cultures and people groups and things like this all over the world that's fair enough but
(10:26) then you would have to also say in that same breath if they're all just subjective then who's giving them to who
(10:32) and who can take them away from who sure so I guess rights are established
(10:38) within a civilization it's or within a usually within national borders it's
(10:43) decided like what what do people need in order to have a prosperous life or to
(10:49) have like an equal opportunity i'm just saying usually the physical enforcement is there to ensure
(10:56) that like to ensure a bottom line to ensure that people at the bottom even if they're handicapped like I just don't understand why this example is uh you're
(11:02) using it to apply it to women well the Greeks said that uh without law there
(11:09) can be no freedom and what they're saying there is if you don't have an enforcement arm for what keeps you free
(11:17) being like things like a military um things like police things that are enforcement laws in other words uh you
(11:25) can't actually enforce any of these rights how could you how could you possibly do it so since men are the
(11:30) enforcement arm there's really no way out of the fact that you get your rights from them whether you like it or not you
(11:37) could say that egalitarianism as as a principle is great but that really is just begging the question again as to
(11:44) who's giving you your rights you're not giving them to yourself so in other words Farre you didn't wake up one
(11:50) morning with rights of which you gave yourself you have rights which other people allow you to have and can easily
(11:57) take away if they so chose and there wouldn't be anything you could do about it that's my whole point sure your
(12:03) entire neighborhood one day can just decide "We hate Andrew he's annoying he's not mowing as long let's go kill
(12:08) him." Does that mean your rights are loud not if they were women overpowered by a large Not if they were women they could do that if they were men though i
(12:15) agree i would agree that men could likely 20 women could come and just decide we're going to overtake Andrew
(12:21) because he's not mowing his lawn i think it would be far more difficult for them to enforce it than 20 men wouldn't you
(12:26) agree and I think that they would probably appeal to men in order to uh
(12:32) exercise the enforcement which is what they do right now which is what women do right now they they appeal to men to
(12:38) exercise all enforcement of all of their rights and all of the things that they want they can't appeal to women because
(12:44) women can't enforce their rights and never have been able to five women or like three women two men come tomorrow
(12:50) kidnap you tie you to a chair and start beating you and I say "Oh well he can't fight back right now we're the one who
(12:55) decides if he eats or sleeps or gets water." Does that mean your rights are laughable the basis of your rights are
(13:01) laughable that makes no sense so what you're No no no enforcement mechanisms
(13:06) are subjective so if I decide under a tyrannical situation and torture you
(13:11) actually you're making my point you're making my point for me so if my rights are being violated and I'm unable to
(13:17) physically do something about it so two men and three women have tied me up they're now depriving me of life liberty
(13:24) and happiness by doing this and I can't physically do something about this who would I appeal to to do something about
(13:30) this if you can't appeal to someone it means the basis of your rights are laughable
(13:36) yeah unless you can tell me what the basis of rights are which is what I've asked you in the beginning the legal basis of your rights
(13:44) yeah I know but what is the the legal basis of the rights come from what
(13:49) in America it comes from the constitution which came from currently the constitution will only be
(13:56) amended legally like I don't think men can just overpower that right now really
(14:02) they tried to uh before in the Civil War currently currently well what's the
(14:08) difference between between now and then they tried to once before what do you mean so if they don't like if men don't
(14:14) like the hand that they've gotten they don't like the nation that they're in they don't like the government that they have they don't like the circumstances
(14:20) they're in collectively they seem to be able to do something about that they can overthrow the entire nation for instance
(14:26) can you point to a country in history you can ever think of where women have collectively overthrown the nation with
(14:32) force okay so by enforcement mechanism you
(14:39) don't mean through like legal or civil me measures you mean through like revolution and those are both physical
(14:45) measures a legal measure is a physical enforcement how else could it how how
(14:51) else could it work like what would what stops you from breaking the law it's a penalty right doesn't somebody enforce
(14:57) the penalty i don't know if this woman is purposely not understanding like I don't know if
(15:03) she genuinely just doesn't understand or if this is just one big cope debate
(15:08) because I mean in my opinion I think Andrew already kind of made this clear from the very beginning it's not really
(15:15) that hard to understand men are stronger physically and you need force to enforce
(15:22) laws like Andrew pointed out there's never been a society where women over overthrew the government and took over
(15:27) there is no nation led by women you know if a bunch of gorillas you know I mean they made this like in Planet of the
(15:33) Apes like if a bunch of gorillas uh all of a sudden became sentient and became smarter than humans and they they
(15:41) learned how to build weapons and strategize uh gorillas could absolutely overthrow humans because they're bigger
(15:47) and stronger than us so we would be at the mercy of the gorillas and the only reason that we would be able to live
(15:53) side by side with gorillas is if they allowed us to and it's the same thing with uh now it doesn't mean that we
(15:59) shouldn't treat women fairly or anything no absolutely we should take care of women should take care of anyone that can't defend themselves but what Andrew
(16:06) is all just trying to say is that if we just changed our minds collectively tomorrow and said "No women don't
(16:11) deserve rights." What could stop us from doing that you're saying revolutions could be spearheaded by anyone i just
(16:17) don't understand why this is like such a gendered idea for you that like women's rights are laughable because a majority
(16:24) could overtake them like that's the case with any larger group of people it's not
(16:29) the case so for instance let's say you had a dynamic where you had 20% men to a
(16:35) 80% female ratio the men would still be in charge we know this i hope that's
(16:41) true well not only can I demonstrate that this is true by showing you nations postwar where a lot of the men up to
(16:48) twothirds in some cases were completely wiped out and the men were still in charge the reason is because even then
(16:56) the power dynamic is so it's sloped uh such in the favor of men that women still need them to enforce their rights
(17:02) women are unable to physically do this type of work themselves at least collectively there might be individual
(17:08) women who are able to be police officers uh great military officials things like this i'm not disagreeing with that i'm
(17:14) talking about on average and in generalities here and in general no women can't enforce rights and have
(17:21) never been able to their rights collectively come from men okay so
(17:26) women's rights are laughable because men if needed can use enforcement mechanisms whether legally or just purely
(17:32) physically to overpower them are children's rights also then laughable hang on back because you're well you're
(17:38) actually straw manning right remember I said the word egalitarianism meaning equality equality is laughable not
(17:45) women's rights not giving rights to women in other words but egalitarianism and equality is laughable because it's
(17:52) paradoxical and the great paradox of it is that you would be appealing to the
(17:58) same group of people who can then take your rights away while at the same time considering yourself equal to those people it's laughable it's a paradox
(18:08) i just don't know if that's a good basis like I don't think you're less than of a human because you are missing a leg or
(18:13) because you're of older age and you probably can't fight back against the younger generation gen Z can decide today we're going to kill off Gen X does
(18:20) that mean there's a terrible terrible argument too because I'm not you're
(18:25) against straw manning i'm not talking about a person who has a disability for instance being a lesser or greater human
(18:31) being that's has no that has no merit to the argument yeah i'm I'm saying to you
(18:38) that it's not that women are lesser human beings in fact I consider them the the same as far as um you know how they
(18:45) should be treated uh they should definitely be treated with respect and dignity and all those wonderful things
(18:51) that we would expect in society for everybody to treat everybody that way but that's not going to change the
(18:57) grounding fact that um that their rights come from men and are enforced by men
(19:03) are senior citizens rights laughable is there equality laughable not not saying that not stronging you by saying that
(19:08) you're assuming they're less than is their equality laughable because they could be fiscally overpowered by
(19:15) generation Y generation Z well okay so we could just decide like
(19:22) this is so right to vote from senior citizens yeah so this is this is overpower them we could decide to Yeah
(19:28) no nursing homes listen listen you're actually you're you're making a pivotal mistake here if you're saying to me like
(19:34) "Can men take rights away from other men?" The answer is yes yes can uh men
(19:42) take rights away from women the answer is yes can women take rights away from men the answer is no no they can't
(19:49) really yes millennial women can't take away rights from senior citizens no not
(19:55) unless men allow it because if men decide collectively not to allow it there's nothing you can do
(20:00) in other words You can never gender decide to take a right away from an older generation co-gendered like I
(20:07) don't understand where this like yes men can still take rights away from men this has been established 50 times but women
(20:13) can't take the rights away from men that's the problem that you have is that even if all of you collectively came
(20:19) together tomorrow like let me ask you this just reasonably think about this say the entirety of the human race
(20:25) decided one day that they were going to go to war with each other all of the men and all of the women who do you think
(20:30) would men all of the men i'm not disputing the
(20:37) fact that men could overpower women i'm just Now hang on hang on for the rest of the thought exercise pretend for a
(20:43) second the entirety of all of women went to war with 20% of the population of men
(20:49) and all the other men stayed out of it who do you think would win
(20:57) honestly I don't know i think war is more about phys is more is about other things than just physical strength it's
(21:02) about like weaponry it's about how you can strategize so I I don't Andrew are
(21:08) we are we assuming a world without like modern weapons and modern technology just like kind of even in a world with
(21:13) modern weapons and modern technology okay even then 80 I would honestly in
(21:21) that case I'm being honest I genuinely think women in that case why we're using modern technology yeah so why do you
(21:27) think that women uh who are generally speaking inept with technology generally
(21:33) we're not saying all women but generally speaking they're inept we know this because of who goes into the
(21:39) technological and STEM fields when we have egalitarianism guess who it still is it's men they overwhelmingly are the
(21:46) engineers they are overwhelmingly the people who fix everything in society they're the ones who create and operate
(21:53) that very same technology i don't think that highly specialized tech like that
(21:58) even then would be something that women could easily deploy against even 20% of men you're talking about something here
(22:05) if you scale it up you start to kind of recognize how how lopsided the power dynamic really is and always will be
(22:12) there's not anything that can be done about it that's what makes this a great paradox to appeal to men for rights and
(22:18) at the same time say that you're equal to men is laughable sure you didn't say all of women and all
(22:25) of men in this instance you said 80% women 20% men even then even then there could still be even though less women go
(22:31) into STEM in that 80% pool there could be more women who are technologically inclined than I still think they would lose i still think if you if you I still
(22:38) think they would lose but the thing is the point being is is that um even if they wouldn't in that particular case
(22:46) just that one particular case maybe it just took 30% of men whatever whatever the collective was okay the power
(22:52) dynamic is ridiculously technologically inept senior citizens are also technologically inept if you put all of
(22:58) men can take rights away from men for the 300 millennial women against all of senior citizen men
(23:05) i think women would win in terms of warfare technologically okay only Okay listen listen hang on hang on let Let
(23:12) her finish let her finish yeah but she's straw manning the entire she doesn't understand it she's not interrupting you
(23:17) just just just let her finish go ahead okay go ahead listen you're straw manning the position i think you don't
(23:22) understand it you can have great monoliths of one versus the other and possibly overwhelm them that's really
(23:28) not the point it's that if women were to all the millennial women were to decide tomorrow that the senior citizens needed
(23:34) to lose all their rights they would still have to appeal to men in order to allow that to happen so if all the other
(23:41) men were like "Nope they still have rights." Women still couldn't do anything that's my point
(23:46) why would we have to appeal to them this thought experiment involved warfare if you're at war who are you appealing to
(23:52) you're just a technological for whatever the dispers the the uh
(23:58) dispersement is okay let's say it's like 200 to one right so men can take out
(24:04) like 20 women to one woman's fine or let's just say it's two to two to one it doesn't really matter right what I'm
(24:10) saying is is that as long as men are involved in governance as long as men are involved in society you and your
(24:18) rights and your appeals to take rights away or give rights to any group of people at any time has to necessarily be
(24:25) an appeal to men so even within the confines of the thought experiment if we took all of that out I could just yield
(24:31) the entire thing to you and say "Sure maybe in that instance I'll just give it to you." It just doesn't really matter
(24:36) though i'm not refuting that you have to appeal to other people for your rights i'm refuting that that appeal means that
(24:43) your equality is laughable same way you probably wouldn't argue that just because a senior citizen again has to
(24:48) appeal to the general public most of whom are younger most of whom are more technologically inclined than them like I said even a millennial woman is more
(24:54) technologically inclined than a senior citizen man probably at this point that doesn't mean their equality is laughable
(25:01) listen the senior citizens who are men understand just like all men do that
(25:08) other men are in a position to take their rights away anytime they choose unless you have some type of collective
(25:14) that can stop that that's why we have a military that's why we have all these different things to enforce the rights
(25:21) this is well understood you claiming "Wait a second what if a bunch of women
(25:27) got together to take the rights away from senior citizens?" Well they could
(25:32) do that but you would have to bank on all of the other men outside of that external to that allowing you to do that
(25:39) because if they said no you couldn't whereas if the roles were reversed and a
(25:44) group of men were to decide to do that they could and if you opposed it you
(25:50) couldn't stop it that's the difference
(25:57) i think she just doesn't want to face the reality i just think she doesn't want to admit and accept it you know
(26:02) she's been brainwashed into this modern-day feminism that she can't fathom the the the truth that if men
(26:10) were to change our minds and be like you know right this moment nope take away
(26:15) women's rights and all men decided this uh there would be nothing that they
(26:20) could do i know it's hard for for her to accept it but it's just the truth doesn't mean we should do it doesn't
(26:26) mean yeah we should just take away the rights no one's advocating that what do you guys think about this so far leave a comment down in the comment section
(26:32) below give this video a like if you like it if you're really liking it please consider subscribing to my channel let's
(26:37) get back to it see the equivalency between needing to appeal to majority and meaning that your rights are
(26:42) laughable but I guess if your base of rights is based off physical enforcement
(26:48) then Oh no listen this is fundamental she's like hung up on that whole laughable thing she keeps bringing it up
(26:54) like she is she is stuck on that one word doesn't mean the rights are laughable it doesn't mean this like no
(27:00) one's saying that women's rights are laughable pivotal to any argument you'll ever make in your entire life all of
(27:07) your rights are based on enforcement unless you can give me a basis for them outside of that
(27:15) that just can't be the case because the notion of rights wouldn't need to exist we wouldn't need to establish rights for
(27:20) people if each person could physically enforce it themselves the whole point of establishing baseline of rights is
(27:25) because you're assuming people are fundamentally different physically and intellectually so how can you say your rights don't matter because you're
(27:31) physically inferior when that differentiation is what justifies your rights in the first place that's why we
(27:37) even establish rights you haven't justified rights at all you just say this is what justifies them the fact
(27:43) that there's inferiority between different people okay is that the justification that the justification for
(27:48) rights is based on inferiority is that is that what you're saying is your justification for a right said
(27:55) differences the differences is the justification was as uh intellectually and physically capable as the person
(28:02) next to them i don't think we would need to establish human rights okay so probably So you think that rights then
(28:08) come from your mind they don't come from any external source just people make them up
(28:15) when did I What do you mean well I mean if absent something for you to ground
(28:20) this axiom on some unless it that's all it is just like a a pure axiom to your
(28:26) own preferences you'd have to tell me what you're justifying having a right on where it comes from where does a right
(28:33) actually come from other than your your mind you made it up if that's the case then you have
(28:39) then you have a big problem so did it did it come out of out of the people's minds or does it come external did they
(28:45) come from God like our our founders said or where do they come from i'm asking
(28:50) you where do rights come from for you because I'm saying think rights what God I think I think that uh well as far as
(28:57) innate human rights the way that you perceive them we don't perceive them the same way but I would say that I would
(29:02) ground I ground all of my epistemology and ontology on my faith so all the
(29:08) things that I think are informed by faith and would be informed by God but from your perspective your secular
(29:15) perspective you're just saying that rights are just something that people made up one day and then you say "But enforcement isn't necessary," which is
(29:22) really bizarre and makes no sense and I'm trying to get you to square it necessary i said enforcement is crucial
(29:28) to rights then rights come from men if so if enforcement is crucial to them men are the enforcers of those rights not
(29:34) women so therefore you're you're basically begging them for rights what the majority establishes is those rights
(29:40) but I'm saying just because your rights can be taken away how does that make the basis of equality
(29:45) laughable because it means that you would always be appealing to people who can take your rights away as being equal
(29:51) with you when you can't take theirs away you can take them away but does that
(29:56) mean justified nope you can't take them away men can take them away but not but
(30:01) not women women can't take men's rights away not monolithically democracy if a majority of voters decide to change the
(30:08) basis of rights again they could take it away from the minority of senior citizens well first of all we're not in a democracy we're in a republic and it
(30:15) takes more than a simple majority of which women do outnumber men but it's only slightly so they would still need
(30:20) even men in that coalition to do so so women as a singular entity can't do anything outside of voting uh but even
(30:28) with voting they would need men but absent voting they certainly can't enforce their rights whereas men can
(30:33) enforce their rights even absent voting so if we don't like what's going on at the ballot box or in the nation or in the country we can physically do
(30:39) something about that we can change the regime we can change the president we can change whatever the [ __ ] we want and
(30:45) um society basically just has to deal with it there's nothing that they can do about it uh they're at the mercy of men
(30:51) so men are at the mercy of men and women are at the mercy of men but all of them are appealing to men for rights okay so
(30:57) you said you're a Christian right so you believe in a theological basis for rights so what do you see as rights then
(31:02) since you have a more objective understanding of them since mine's secular um I don't think that we have
(31:09) innate rights the way that you think that we have innate rights i think that we have an obligation and duties to
(31:16) follow certain virtues and that those virtues might often times run contrary
(31:22) to what you might consider an innate human right of which I don't consider an innate human right so examples of this
(31:29) might be I don't know discrimination let's say against transgender people using the bathroom or something like
(31:34) this i don't consider that to be virtuous and so I would be against such a thing even though a person like you
(31:40) might say well wait a second uh this is a fundamental human right or something like this the difference is is that all
(31:47) of my positions on that are informed and I'm basing all of it grounding all of it
(31:52) on the Bible and on God you're grounding all all of everything you believe is a right just basically out of your own
(31:59) brain what you think subjectively is a right and what isn't okay so what do you then see as
(32:05) fundamental human rights fundamental i don't think for instance
(32:10) uh that people have the right to murder other people i don't think they have the right to steal from other people um
(32:16) there's kind of an inexhaustive normative list of things that I think we would likely agree on uh but on the
(32:22) other hand I don't see egalitarianism as being a fundamental human right never have i think it's like I said in many
(32:28) cases it's laughable like this one i certainly don't see uh Only Fans as a
(32:34) right i don't see speech as being necessarily a right i don't see any of those types of things as being
(32:39) fundamental to the human experience or a human right so I think uh I think you
(32:45) and I would see rights very differently but unless you have a criticism of those things which I'm happy to get into you
(32:52) still are kind of question begging with the with the whole idea that well wait a
(32:57) second no it's the majority that gives rights it's not the majority that gives rights it's men that give rights men are
(33:03) the ones who can bestow them upon you and they're the ones who can take them away we know this because collectively
(33:09) women cannot and have not ever been able to do this ever
(33:14) i was saying that because you were using the thought experiment of imagine 80% you're at war and then if 80% of the
(33:22) people at war are women and 20% of men who do you think would win and I was saying that instance I think it's not
(33:27) completely out of the realm of possibility that the women would win but you were disagreeing with that but let's
(33:32) say they did win do women now have a basis for rights if if you women were
(33:38) able to physically uh overpower and take their their rights and give them to
(33:44) themselves somehow sure all you have to do is show me where that's ever happened and I'm happy to say "Hey sometimes they
(33:51) do that but they don't ever do that." And have not ever been able to do that and the reason they can't do that is
(33:57) because uh well men are way [ __ ] stronger and way more aggressive and have higher testosterone and it seems to
(34:04) bother them far less to um kill things than it does women so that's why
(34:10) essentially women are completely under the thumb of men um and everything
(34:15) outside of that is basically just an illusion it's an illusion that we tell ourselves but you're always appealing to
(34:21) men for your rights there's no way around it okay i guess I'm still trying to wonder
(34:27) why you're only applying this idea that if you can't physically enforce the rights it means it's laughable just to
(34:33) women again and if you're not applying it again that's not what I'm saying i'll say it again handicapped maybe I'm missing i'll say it again say it again
(34:42) pretend for a second that there was a God a God not the God right we'll just
(34:47) pretend that there's a God and the God comes down and says "You and I are now equal you can do everything I can do
(34:55) except all the things that you can't do that I can do but we're totally equal."
(35:00) Would you agree if if the God says to you "You are now me you and I are now
(35:05) equal you just can't do all the things I can do right i'm going to make you a god just like me but you can do all the
(35:12) things that I can do except certain things that you can't are you equal with that person or are you not equal with
(35:18) that person or that entity
(35:24) i don't know if having the same strengths again is the basis for rights like I'm saying
(35:30) I think we establish rights again I don't know if she's pretending not to understand or if she's genuinely just
(35:38) just doesn't understand but I I don't I honestly watching I don't know how
(35:43) Andrew can make this any more clearer and I think that God example that he just uh put out there right now I think
(35:50) that's the perfect way to explain it is she just refusing to understand it or what we're accepting that people Yeah
(35:56) but just to the to the thought experiment would you say that you were equal with that being or not
(36:03) no I don't think you don't you don't think right you don't think that because that would be absurd and laughable and
(36:09) paradoxical that the being who says to you now let's say the being says now all the things I just gave you I can also
(36:16) take away if you displease me but we're equals would you do you think that do you think that uh you would actually be
(36:22) equal with that being or no okay wait so you're saying the idea that women's equality to men is laughable but are you
(36:28) saying the basis of women's rights is laughable or just the equality well I've
(36:35) already said this that I think that women have the same rights as men do uh in this particular case whatever men
(36:41) decide to give them it'd be the same thing that men decide to give other men uh that's how traditionally it's always
(36:47) been done in every single society that we've ever been in um so I mean nobody
(36:52) nobody in any society that I'm aware of in as normative uh frame is able to just
(36:58) like murder women because they want to that's uh that's that's pretty absurd so as far as fundamental rights go because
(37:05) you and I see rights differently yes I think that women would have the same kind of rights I would express that men
(37:10) have but it still would be a truism that men are the ones who are granting those rights
(37:17) okay so then to kind of pivot slightly given that like I'm guessing you don't
(37:24) support feminism or do you still support feminism even though you think or you
(37:29) think feminism is useless because well this is why I asked your definition well I didn't even really have to ask cuz you
(37:35) you kind of let me let me know what you thought feminism was in the opening and in the opening what you said that
(37:41) feminism was was a move towards egalitarianism and equality between men and women so if that's the basis of
(37:47) feminism then feminism would indeed be laughable because again you would just be calling this grouping and monolith
(37:55) and saying that they have equality with the very people they're appealing to for equality who can then take it away
(38:01) whenever they so choose i don't think I gave a sameness definition of feminism
(38:07) at all i didn't say you did i said you said it was about equality what you said it was about equality yeah
(38:13) that's what sameness feminism is think I was saying that modern feminism is about not devaluing feminine traits i don't
(38:22) think I said that feminism is about uh propagating that men and women are equal andrew can I very quickly I want to
(38:29) really quickly clean up your position for the chat because uh RA your wife was saying what your position is so I want
(38:34) to make sure this is accurate so you're talking about the uh what is right but what about in terms of ought to do you
(38:40) do you believe that women ought to have rights rights as well or you're just talking purely about the what is well
(38:46) I've already covered that right so yes of course I think that they're they ought to have the same rights okay
(38:52) ordinarily that I would ascribe in a Christian virtue ethic to anybody sure
(38:58) okay got it okay cool yeah i don't think that that's um that's in any way contrasted to anything I say i'm just
(39:04) saying that even then that even then I still understand on the is front that
(39:11) those rights whether I think they come from God or not um I still I still
(39:17) believe that men would be the ones who are going to ultimately uh be the enforcement arm for them and the ones
(39:23) who could take them away from me or give them to me whenever they so choose to do so which historically they've done many
(39:29) times okay okay so if men are the enforcement arm what do you think they ought to be
(39:35) enforcing then like what rights do you think should be taken away from women or do you think you should still extend
(39:41) equal rights to women even though you could theoretically take them away
(39:46) you mean as I'm trying to figure this out what do you What are you asking me i guess I'm asking what your point is like
(39:52) I guess what I'm you're saying that men can take My point is that you're not equal to men that women aren't equal to men because you can't enforce their own
(39:58) rights men have to enforce them for them so they're begging at the altar for men to enforce their rights while at the
(40:03) same time saying that they're equal to men it's absurd they're not equal to men they they're never going to be there's
(40:09) never going to be an egalitarian society because of this one fact that men can collectively whenever they so choose
(40:14) even in a small collective just snatch your rights away and there's nothing you [ __ ] do about it that's what I'm saying that's why feminism is absurd
(40:21) that's why the girl power shit's all [ __ ] absurd it's all stupid it's all [ __ ] makes no sense because you're
(40:28) appealing you're appealing to the people who could take your rights away for your rights and saying you're equal with them
(40:33) it's absurd that's not and if if that's not the position then that's not feminism because that's what feminism is
(40:39) it's a push towards the egalitarian n uh nature of men and women saying that we're equal in every way we're almost
(40:45) interchangeable widgets that's that's what it's saying that's what its proposal is
(40:52) i think feminism or at least in like the girl power strand that you were just describing is saying that even though
(40:59) women are physically inferior to men I I don't think most women or the average feminist is going to argue that women
(41:06) uh are physically equal to men or could physically overpower a man typically i think they're more so saying that
(41:13) they're uh generally as intellectually capable obviously in the most extremes I
(41:18) think if you're comparing extremes I think the most intelligent people are men and then also the dumbest people are
(41:24) men but just in general the average pools of men and women are generally equally as smart so I think like the
(41:30) girl power strand of feminism is just saying that women are just capable in the workforce they're just capable of
(41:36) making decisions i So what how does even what you were saying relate to that to
(41:43) those virtues of feminism so this is this is a pivot to kind of a a whole
(41:48) different topic which I'm willing to get into yeah no it's totally a pivot and you know so now that she knows that she's
(41:55) lost that debate about the whole uh you know men give and take away can give and take away women's rights and stuff like
(42:02) that now she's pivoting to more the intellect the she's pivoting more to the intellect the intellectual level about
(42:09) that you know women can make decisions and women can do this this and that uh which by the way I disagree i don't
(42:15) think that's what feminism is feminism is about pushing toward equality well more like equity nowadays between men
(42:22) and women and assuming that women if there not a ton of women CEOs out there
(42:28) it's because of the patriarchy it's because uh you know it's because men have kept women out of uh these spaces
(42:35) and women have oppressed men or men have oppressed women like I think Andrew uh
(42:40) assessment of how they treat women and men as interchangeable u I think is pretty spot-on but before
(42:47) before I do jump into that with you uh can can you make the concession that
(42:53) women's rights come fundamentally from men
(43:02) i would make the concession that rights are established
(43:07) by the by the government uh in the nation
(43:15) you live in and then that the government is usually spearheaded by men yeah
(43:22) if you don't that's not what I'm asking can you agree or do you still disagree that your rights women's rights
(43:29) fundamentally come from men do you agree or disagree with that because if you
(43:34) agree with that you can concede and we can move off of this point
(43:42) hello yeah hey we can hear you okay i was plugging my phone sorry repeat that one
(43:48) more time i said so again I need to ask you one more time can you make the concession that women's rights come from
(43:57) men if you make that concession and concede that that point we can move on to the next point
(44:02) i don't think I can i think I would I think I I'm not extremely religious so I
(44:09) can't give you like a clean theological basis for rights but I I I don't think I would agree with that
(44:15) yeah right but this is why we keep on make that concession right this is why we keep on
(44:20) going round and round on this right because I make an argument you you end
(44:26) up inevitably agreeing with what I'm saying but you still won't make the concession on the point because it
(44:31) collapses a large portion of your worldview this is very common with feminists you see what I'm saying hang
(44:36) on saying that who's able to enforce those rights isn't equivalent to the basis of those rights so I was saying
(44:43) just because rights can be violated by men I don't think that
(44:49) means the basis of those rights is male determined does that make sense nope it
(44:55) doesn't it's still you're still within the the realm of the paradox so let me try this a different way let me try this
(45:00) a different way um this what I'm saying to you the
(45:06) reason I often make this just normative statement to a feminist that their rights are dependent and reliant on men
(45:13) and men's benevolence and because if we're malevolent if we're acting in an evil way we tend to subjugate enslave
(45:21) and things like this right but the reason I make this point even even though it's very normative is because I
(45:27) think most people who are rational agents would just have to kind of agree that it's true on its face there's
(45:34) really no way to argue with it but the reason we end up going round and round and round in a circle and you look more
(45:40) and more absurd every time we circle it again is because you won't concede to it because it collapses a portion of your
(45:46) worldview men are the enforcers of your rights not women do you agree or
(45:52) disagree with this statement i agree that your rights can be
(45:58) physically infringed upon but I don't know if that's the same as saying that because it can be
(46:04) infringed upon or violated that that means the basis of the right doesn't exist i guess that's my contention well
(46:11) who gives you these rights other than the agents who are enforcing them on your behalf you're not giving them to
(46:17) yourself so you didn't wake up one morning you didn't wake up one morning i guess political rights are given by men i'll
(46:24) concede on that in terms of human rights I guess I would have to probably research more and think about where I
(46:30) think human rights fundamentally come from i guess I do see human rights as slightly different
(46:35) than politically afforded rights okay so where do human rights come from like I
(46:41) said I think I would have to probably give it a lot more thought i think that that's a fair answer so I don't um I
(46:48) don't expect you to have it that's a like that's a difficult question so I think that that's a fair answer uh maybe
(46:54) we can revisit that sometime down the road but uh the second thing uh that you had uh going off of my list here was um
(47:04) progressive values for women lead to less fulfilling lives for progre progressive women on average that was
(47:10) the other one that you took contention with my am I right there or I would just like I guess I'd like to hear you
(47:16) elaborate more on it i've heard conservatives say that uh women fulfilling traditional roles tend to be
(47:21) happier is that kind of the crux of your argument well it depends on what you mean by a traditional role so I think
(47:27) people get these confused a bit i think that um a lot of times progressive women
(47:32) are thinking like a 1930s or 40s uh utopian nuclear family dynamic household
(47:38) leave it to Beaver style uh but that's not actually correct when we're talking about tradition we're just basically
(47:44) doing everything within the frame of the religious so when we're talking about progressive values they're all based on
(47:49) secularism so they have nothing to base anything on except their own subjective preferences and so they end up in this
(47:56) kind of quagmire of contention but if you want to just go off of empirics the mental illness for women is off the
(48:03) charts in comparison to men uh is in fact even seeking professionals for
(48:08) women is off the charts in comparison to men so is the rates that they attempt in adolescent suicide in comparative
(48:15) comparatively to men um as the society in other words has become more egalitarian across the board women seem
(48:22) to be suffering more not less in fact there's a paper here which I can link you and this um this paper cites it
(48:29) pretty good it's called an an evolutionary I'm sorry it's a uh the paradox of the um the leadership gaps
(48:39) and the paradox of the gaps when it comes to mental health and women uh it
(48:44) asked the question how come gains in women's rights haven't made women any happier how come that hasn't actually
(48:50) done anything to produce these happy women uh that feminism promised us when
(48:57) feminism first began uh through the suffragettes like what's the um you know
(49:03) what's what's what's the aim here what is the aim of feminism if not a happier better society for women why are they
(49:10) all so [ __ ] miserable the more egalitarian they get um I guess it depends whether you value
(49:17) hedonism or not i don't know if a lot of people consider happiness and pleasure as like the ultimate goal of life like I
(49:25) think a woman could say maybe I'm happier like less happy in this situation but I don't necessarily regret
(49:31) it i think a lot of people do like pursuing something that gives them a sense of purpose um but I don't know if
(49:37) necessarily pursuing something that gives you purpose leads to more pleasure in your life yeah but what would be your
(49:43) explanation for uh women having more trouble with mental health and reporting
(49:48) in almost every single individual aspect of their life that they're more miserable than when the polls that came
(49:55) before uh pulled them in years past where they're saying that they were much happier and society had a much larger
(50:02) gap between men and women with what women were allowed to do including things like bank accounts things like
(50:07) this i mean we've definitely come a long way with feminism especially in the last
(50:12) 40 years but the miserable index for women is at an all-time high i I just I
(50:18) can't fathom how that could be possible as we close this gap if feminism is accomplishing its goal why women are
(50:24) more miserable under it um I don't know if this is necessarily the answer but I would say that if you
(50:30) asked me 10 years ago when I'm like 13 years old if I have anxiety I would say
(50:36) no because I don't really have necessarily the self-standing of what that means versus if you ask me now I'd
(50:42) say yes i don't think that necessarily means that I have more anxiety or that my life is worse than it was 10 years
(50:48) ago I would say by every metric my life is significantly better and that I'm significantly more fulfilled so I think
(50:54) likewise if women are kind of relegated to the household and to traditional roles and they're kind of isolated and
(51:01) they only they can't really AB test what life is like outside of it then I think it's easier to dismiss negative feelings
(51:09) like I think you need to have um so wait hang on I just want to make sure I got this right i want to make sure I got
(51:16) this right i want you to understand that the argument you just made was you said it's because those dumb housewives
(51:22) haven't experienced anything outside of being dumb housewives so basically it's blissful in their ignorance that's what
(51:29) you're saying um I don't know if I would say dumb i would say
(51:38) sometimes for instance I think they uh I saw a statistic that says in some
(51:43) countries like in uh less developed countries people there also
(51:49) report more happiness but I don't think the average western person would say
(51:55) that they have a better life necessarily like I think we could look at them and say okay there are ways in
(52:01) which they have pro in some always a lower quality of life right so that's why I don't know if just the
(52:07) self-reporting on happiness is a good enough indication well no that wouldn't be but uh have the information right
(52:13) here more than a quarter of American women 26% take drugs which include
(52:19) anti-depressants 26% that more than a quarter of all women take
(52:25) anti-depressants anti Andrew what is it what is it what is it for men 26 what's
(52:30) that what is that number for men just so we have a comparison varies between 12 to 15% okay got it so it's much lower
(52:38) okay much much lower same thing with anti-csychotics okay women aren't doing so hot and all this egalitarianism that
(52:45) you've been pushing for that has been going full throttle you've been getting everything that you feminists have
(52:51) wanted and uh when it's delivered unto you you seem to go batshit [ __ ] crazy
(52:56) isn't that weird isn't that odd to you i think the number of people on a hunted
(53:03) depressence has gone up in general even for men right slightly yes but the
(53:08) deviation between men and women what would you uptick in uh male usage of anti-depressants too i
(53:15) would say it's due to male oppression the fact that men have been systematically oppressed inside of the
(53:21) United States under these horrific egalitarian laws where we don't have
(53:26) egalitarianism at all but rather we get raped in divorce courts the laws are fundamentally unfair and for the same
(53:34) crime that a woman is charged with men are unfairly punished the suicide rates of men are sky-high in comparison to
(53:40) women they get the job done and it's not that women don't attempt it but it's mostly a cry out for help because they take pills and then they call somebody
(53:47) and say "I took some pills come save me." They put that up to a suicide attack whereas men just get the job done
(53:52) right they just take a gun and that's the way that they end up handling that so all of these things I would say that
(53:59) men are unfairly oppressed in society and that's led to a slight uptick and there seems to be enough correlates
(54:05) there for me to make such a bold claim but I would like to still know because we seem to just be begging the question
(54:11) why in the world do you think that women who have more egalitarianism now than
(54:17) ever before have more of these gaps closed than ever before are more [ __ ] miserable than ever before wait I first
(54:24) have a question on something you said so if men kind of establish the framework of rights and happiness why is it that
(54:31) men are the ones disproportionately uh facing oppression in society well remember what I said earlier that men
(54:38) also oppress men that men are the mechanism for that as well i don't blame
(54:44) women for this that's not the crux of my argument i still think that men are the
(54:49) responsible party when it comes to the oppression in general of other men
(54:56) affecting men more than women if men are the ones who are like you said disproportionately affecting women more
(55:02) than it is men it's just that in this particular case when you're talking about the uptick the slight uptick in
(55:07) things like suicidality and things like this it's because the laws which are on the books tend to favor women because
(55:14) women are a great consumer arm for corporate America they're in charge of most of the money literally they they're
(55:20) in charge of almost all consumer spending so laws are kind of tailored to kiss their ass corporations and
(55:26) lobbyists have gone out of their way under feminism to make sure that women's asses are kissed and men seem to suffer
(55:31) greatly because of that okay so men create a framework that
(55:38) oppresses wh men so that they can make more money off female consumer spending
(55:45) is that what I said is that honestly what you think I said i need to know is that honestly what you think I just said
(55:51) i'm asking yeah I know you're asking but you're asking a question that's not in relationship to anything I just said so
(55:57) the question doesn't even make sense so what just happened would be like if I walk over to a guy and I say "What color
(56:03) do you want me to paint your fence?" And he looks at me and he says "Um margarine hat." Be like "What the [ __ ] are you
(56:09) talking about?" Right you might have be asking me a question but it's not in relationship to anything I just said so
(56:16) if you if do you want to ask me a question in relationship to something I actually said
(56:21) sure can you summarize what your point was then yes my point is that again as
(56:28) countries have become more and more egalitarian under feminism under and
(56:33) this is feminist women and femin maybe if she paid more attention to what he was saying instead of like typing on
(56:40) whatever she's typing on her screen because that's what all that freaking noise is i I wish uh Alex the moderator
(56:46) would tell her "Hey could you quit it with the freaking typing?" You know not only would it be less annoying for us the viewer but then maybe she could
(56:53) actually listen to his argument and understand what he's asking men who are
(56:58) coming together under the same banner of Iheart women's rights it's become more
(57:04) egalitarian why is it that the index for all of these mental illnesses and problems for women are through the roof
(57:11) when feminism made the promise that these things should necessarily decrease
(57:20) feminism made the promise that mental illness for women would go down that all aspect of women that the quality
(57:27) opportunity i don't know if feminism that the quality of women's lives would greatly increase it has not seemingly
(57:33) done that unless you think that a woman's quality of life is not impacted by mental illness which I would say it
(57:38) is especially if 25% are on an anti-csychotic anti-depressant or some variation thereof
(57:46) i don't know if that's necessarily feminism's fault like you just said we're in a framework in which sometimes
(57:52) laws are created to that like disaffect people mentally
(57:57) like you just pointed to the divorce courts i guess I'm just trying to wonder why are you attributing the uptick
(58:02) in women's mental illness to feminism singularly like how come you don't think it's just an effect of just I don't know
(58:10) other consequences of modern because because women are the ones who have
(58:15) pushed and and feminists male feminists as well have pushed for egalitarianism
(58:21) and across the board in nations we see that become more egalitarian we see this
(58:26) huge gap increase between men and women when it comes to women a wanting to do
(58:32) things that are more in line with their gender which is a bizarre side effect feminists never want to talk about but
(58:37) also that their state of mental happiness and mental health seems to rapidly deteriorate which is [ __ ]
(58:43) bizarre these are we can link this because we can look at other countries that have way more egalitarianism than
(58:50) even the United States and we see similar numbers yeah I guess I should
(58:56) probably read more about those studies and then we can reconvene at a later time i don't want to Okay
(59:04) that's all I I mean that's all I really had to be honest yeah this woman is kind of annoying like Andrew is trying to be
(59:10) like in good faith as much as possible and she either goes "Well I haven't read much of those studies." Well um and and
(59:18) clearly like Andrew I think hit the nail right on the head earlier when he was saying it shattered a part of her
(59:24) worldview and that's why it's so hard for her to concede the point cuz again I think Andrew has made himself very clear
(59:30) he's brought up good arguments brought up good uh analogies and sh such and she like I said I've been saying throughout
(59:37) this whole thing she either pretending not to understand or she genuinely doesn't but I honestly am leaning more
(59:45) uh toward that she's pretending not to understand because it's not any simpler like Andrew can't make it any simpler
(59:51) and she's still like I don't want to concede this i don't want to admit that i don't know about this i don't know about that bad faith just all around
(59:58) with this girl if you want to see the whole debate uh there's a link down in the description below how did you What
