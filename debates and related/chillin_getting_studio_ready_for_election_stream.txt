Title: Chillin' | Getting Studio Ready for Election Stream

(0:54) well Windows not only resets your  um

(1:02) like your audio randomly like your default devices I feel like it also  with your resolution all the time

(1:07) too there's got to be like a I feel like somebody put in a service some engineer put in a service that just every time

(1:13) Windows starts it it like randomly generates like default devices like just to with you like there's no reason

(1:19) for it to exist they just do it to with you because they know it' be like  hilarious if every time you turn on your computer like why is this at 30

(1:25) HZ like why it shouldn't be it should be at 60 but 50% of the time time this computer gets restarted it'll just

(1:32) change to 30 but why there's no reason none of these are

(1:49) changing there's a conflict between the Windows audio endpoint generator it sounds made up but it isn't that I'm convinced fuy settings on cool guy

(1:56) high-end setups it's not even on cool guy high-end setups like if I like in every monitor these days for whatever

(2:02) reason I don't know why well no I know why every monitor has built-in speakers so every time you connect a monitor to

(2:07) your computer your computer is like oh like look we can play sound here but it's like no I don't ever want to play I

(2:13) didn't buy a $500 monitor or whatever to play sound out of the tiny horrible

(2:19) built-in monitor speakers and when was like okay um I get that but uh next time

(2:25) you start your computer we're going to just do that anyway K is going down over and over again uh hold

(2:34) on oh I know why um we have to do this and then we

(2:40) got to do 1920 by 1080 oh yeah sometimes we you plug in

(2:45) PlayStation controllers I remember that way back in the day let's play um let's play audio through your through

(2:52) your PlayStation controller why not it reminds me of only the only the oldest and wisest of the computer Council will

(2:59) remember this um but it reminds me of way back in the day it for some reason it was just standard practice that if you bought a

(3:05) case it would always come with the shittiest power supply ever um like and

(3:12) there's there was never a single person ever building their own computer Who You'd buy a case $150 half X whatever

(3:19) you'd buy a $150 case and it would come with this the weirdest $20 um $20 Cheapo power supply ever it's

(3:28) like why who's who's buying case and then using the included power supply

(3:44) ever how close you were to blowing your brains out when the Jubilee thing ended with Isn't it nice to have a civil conversation oh yeah Jesus those people

(3:50) were Relentless oh you guys got to see the memes I have never been so owned in my

(3:56) life than when the one guy sat down and he was like he was like oh so you think the fake

(4:02) electors were illegal and I was like yeah and he's like really what's the law and I'm like I mean the law that governs

(4:09) you know how you do your CER no no no no no no no no no what's the law what do you mean like like the

(4:18) number of the law like the penal code yes I don't know it off hand H

(4:25) QED okay

(4:38) me I

(4:47) guess camera are you okay I have the iris on autofocus but

(4:54) it's not I feel like it should be uh closing a ton

(5:01) oh there it

(5:08) goes what an

(5:22) adventure the Alex com was taken really well by his audience it's hard to tell now on some videos cuz my audience is

(5:28) big enough that it gets posted myself readit that I can't tell if it's just you guys brigading comments not that that's bad it's not bad to Brigade it's

(5:35) I mean the YouTube videos that you're supposed to do but it's just hard to tell sometimes with the organic feedback from the

(5:45) audiences yeah now I just need the Reddit post of extremely disappointed and Steven for spending so much time on

(5:51) dailies instead of memorizing the penal code of every single criminal offense he talks about how is he ever going to be taken seriously as a debater when he's

(5:57) not willing to put in the minimum amount of debate prep

(6:11) if I wanted to like have you guys like on a little monitor when I walk around how would I do

(6:22) [Music] this I guess I could just work here I

(6:29) think it help that Alex is a lot more critical with you at least for Optics sake that can have a big impact I mean I guess but it's

(6:39) like I don't I didn't have time to watch the full Ben Shapiro Jubilee thing

(6:45) but just curious how many personal attacks were

(6:50) there in Ben Shapiro's Jubilee were there people going at him constantly like in mine cuz holy

(7:06) the trans man did oh true actually some of those people might have

(7:30) I put the 4090 and the new power supply in my Big Boy Studio

(7:36) PC I'm transplanting this uh my another old build into this so that our election

(7:42) stream night guy has a computer to work out of and then I got Furniture to build oh

(7:48) my God

(8:00) that feel when they start reading off a list of dead people oh yeah I probably look like an there but like bro give me a break we're we really doing

(8:06) this right now you're really going to sit here and start reading a list of dead people come on do you know any of

(8:12) these people get the out of here whose funeral did you go to come

(8:18) on forget about

(8:28) it my favorite thing was when um did they show they might I heard they cut

(8:33) one prompt from the Jubilee thing like that's standard they always cut one prompt they'll cut the weakest did they have it um in my show

(8:40) where there were people that would get they would sit down and then they would preach at me and they wouldn't even get voted off they would just like stand up

(8:47) and walk away after I'm like what that's a that's a strategy had even considered

(9:28) the guy you chose to have bit at the end did that once I think did he

(9:39) actually I talked to that guy a bit at the end apparently he lives near me I I

(9:45) couldn't I don't know

(9:52) man when you called them retards I got super Affinity even the girl said you want to get pegged yeah I was trying to balance my or uh because I'd

(10:00) been like super aggressive um is this your first 40 series GPU make

(10:05) sure to proper 16 Pin cable yeah the PSU I got a new PSU of course um so I'm trying to like balance

(10:13) my like I'm trying not to come in with like the Super Saiyan down your throat be ultra aggressive

(10:19) or I'm trying to be like a little bit more chill but um I'm going to be honest I almost lost

(10:26) it a few times there were a couple times that blonde chick and then um with the crazy Yoni ball woman where I almost was

(10:32) like okay you know what you know what it's time for some

(10:40) tactical

(10:51) something that's your blue light flickers a little shut the

(10:57) up you're talking about the hue light in the back right I know it does I'm just going to hope that most people don't

(11:02) notice it the reality is is for the 12 people

(11:07) out there that like to stream with LEDs I don't know why but the um well I know why I just don't know

(11:14) what the reason is um the Hue Lights the um the refresh

(11:22) rate on the bulb doesn't play nicely with um 30 or 60 frame rates on cameras

(11:29) um I don't know if it would be considered rolling shutter that causes that effect but it happens with Hub

(11:35) bulbs I'm not sure why or I mean I said why I don't I just don't know why they're why they have that refresh rate

(11:41) uh compared to other lights like it doesn't happen with any

(11:50) other think the is some nonstandard pwm frequency

(11:56) okay what did Andrew mean by cheating or collusion uh I think people just talked in the beginning about like who wanted

(12:02) to go when or like that basically um yeah honestly I don't know how big of

(12:08) a difference it made but hold on one second it's more efficient to pulse LED

(12:14) instead of having it constantly on um yeah but for some reason these pulse in

(12:20) a way that doesn't play well with standard camera or standard internet camera refresh rates I don't know why

(12:31) why do you keep spamming this question why was the sex therapist there she was I don't know I don't know why they invited every single individual they did

(12:36) email the directors It's probably hard to find any conservative that isn't the most insane person ever so these

(12:41) were the least insane people they could find and that's saying something

(13:14) looks like a 20% chance that I mixed up the cables for this power supply and another

(13:20) one so I hope that when I turn this on it melts my that's what I'm

(13:25) praying for

(14:11) do you think there's validity to the story of trump and Mike Johnson how they're going to attempt to steal the election um bro I don't know hopefully

(14:19) not hopefully the election is a Landslide but who knows what's going to happen at this point who the knows

(14:30) what if Trump does try to lead some like actual Revolution because he realizes that if he loses the election there's a

(14:37) decent chance that he'll see the inside of a prison cell maybe for the rest of his

(14:52) life you're trying to bet and win some free money on comma at these insane odds oh I don't even know how to send up to

(14:57) that poly Market site I should though cuz I already got a um 10K bet with uh

(15:02) Wes so it's like it's a free Arbitrage basically right I should bet on

(15:09) um no wait that doesn't make sense I would have to bet on I would have had to have bet West for Trump and then bet

(15:16) comma on poly Market I think

(15:21) right free Arbitrage assuming the site pays out yeah that's true actually

(15:30) what do you about Israel and Lebanon you think their objectives are sound bro I don't know man who don't ask me about anything I don't know anything about

(15:36) Israel apparently I thought they would have gotten I thought that um Hezbollah would have presented I said it

(15:41) a million times after 2006 I thought they would have presented a significant obstacle to Israel's military and Israel

(15:47) completely surgically annihilated um like I shouldn't say

(15:52) annihilated but did significant damage to Hezbollah and then they killed like all the top leadership in Hamas and they

(15:58) just another 600 um another 600  Hamas uh militants in was it

(16:05) Northern Gaza so you know who knows who the knows God's chosen people

(16:21) true that see the Florida Republican I voted for D santz yesterday over Trump comma never won me over but Trump is an

(16:26) egomaniac I can't wait until we get back to boring policy debates not cring crap

(16:32) yeah definitely not a fan of Des santz but I would take D santz over Trump a

(16:38) million times over

(16:43) easily I think this morning was the closest I've ever been to tweeting out a death threat

(16:50) before did you see this um

(17:01) ah me I'm too lazy to I have to change all my scenes and everything did you see the uh magga Republican

(17:07) congressman who did a who did a ad shooting at a Ballot

(17:13) Box what the what the  wait you're here what the what the

(17:20) [Applause]

(17:36) try again wrong spot which camera am I on right now oh is the auto switcher

(17:47) on oh jeez oh it might be actually hold

(17:56) on oh it is

(18:15) Andrew Wilson wanted to chat I wonder if I can use Discord on on the studio

(18:26) PC voice and video input analog five and

(18:40) six something that's mind me a little

(18:46) bit is um after I swapped out the Intel 380 the A380 for the

(18:52) um 4090 I had weird issues on that Intel graphics card where my monitors would

(18:58) like flicker on and off like randomly and it would take like 10 minutes for them to like work properly and I'm like they're just monitors there's no way

(19:04) that the GPU could like just not it's not like I'm trying to run games or whatever it's really annoying I haven't had any of that those issues

(19:09) with this GPU I don't know what that yeah I don't know what that means or it's

(19:18) annoying okay this is analog 5 and six the output devices are

(19:26) default you guys hear music when I I play it on this computer right hold on

(19:45) [Music]

(20:10) Intel drivers for multim monitor are still not fully stable I even get issu on my lapt I is that true to support

(20:15) multiple monitors okay well that's weird [Music]

(20:33) what that dark spot on the chair on the left is it dirty or damage it's probably just the um is is it felt or whatever um

(20:40) being pressed in a different

(20:48) direction like that

(21:08) the music is too loud wait there's no shot that's true

(21:14) [Music]

(21:24) right don't listen to that oh okay

(21:30) [Music]

(21:41) hello hello testing one two

(21:51) okay okay am I going to watch the Jubilee thing um probably not

(21:58) or maybe I don't know I don't

(22:08) know my Alex oconor thing came out

(22:18) too it's more party music and less background music can somebody tell me why ordinary sitdown restaurants will

(22:24) play music so loud if I have to scream at the person sitting across from the table your is it

(22:32) actually drives me insane I don't mind music at restaurants and I don't mind loud music if it's

(22:37) supposed to be like a like a dance environment right but sometimes just like an ordinary ass sit down

(22:44) restaurants they be blaring music for no

(22:54) reason there's no reason why a 256 G gab uh 840 Pro should be totally fine for

(23:01) just this computer in the studio right for the guy to stream from like I wouldn't need like more space for anything

(23:09) right I can't think of any reason right no I don't think

(23:14) so at Destiny after all the Taco you got outplayed on Jubilee doesn't seem like you did bad at all yeah no I don't think it was bad it just wasn't I think I'm I

(23:21) think my standards for those performances are higher than

(23:30) it would just be nice to talk substance with literally any person ever ever okay it'd be

(23:38) nice one time in the history of all of trump

(23:46) kind did your recent OBS plugin script work well you definitely did a correc using the built and API versus external

(23:51) bash or python 100% your knowledge and understanding was spot on as well you would make a solid programmer yeah I know I consider myself somewhat of a

(23:57) hypothetical programming expert just like I'm a hypothetical expert at everything what a hypothetical expert is

(24:02) is a person who would be an expert if they put the time into it but they simply choose not to because they have better things to do with their time

(24:19) so I guess one thing that I actually don't talk about no I have talked about it before

(24:26) um I guess I like very minor scripting experience because the two examples would be a long

(24:34) time ago um I mentioned how I used to play muds

(24:39) so on muds were basically games that you would connect to Via tnet and on um tnet

(24:45) was like a it was just like a like a command prompt to log into remote

(24:51) devices I guess I don't actually know what tet was originally supposed to be for but um eventually you would upgrade from

(24:58) tnet to you would get a real uh you would get like a real client right so

(25:04) you might use back in the day it was like a zmud or gud and then when you were a big boy you'd finally get into um

(25:11) generally I think the best was considered it was a program called mush client and um I've talked about this

(25:18) before but like one of the things for cuz I would like go to college um

(25:24) and and so I would be kind of like I wouldn't be able to compete with these  losers who could game 24/7 and

(25:30) they would like power level their characters and I'd be like so like the dream was to you would want to create like a in mush CLI they're called

(25:36) triggers I don't know what you call it in programming something that responds to something else I guess you receive an event and then you reply to it or

(25:42) whatever but so you would create a trigger so that let's say anytime you kill a mob when you kill a mob um you

(25:49) attack another mob because it would respawn in the same room right um so what you might do is you might like you

(25:55) might match a string of text that says uh fighter has fallen to the ground screaming or whatever right that because

(26:00) that means you killed the mob and then the trigger text might be something like kill uh like k space fighter that would

(26:07) be a short hand for a kill fighter and then you would attack and you'd kill the the responding mob right so You' create

(26:12) like a like a simple trigger like this to to Kill um so there was one

(26:20) minor problem and then eventually one major problem unfortunately that you would have to get around so the simple

(26:25) triggers would suck because you'd be restricted in how long you could leave your computer because if you're running

(26:31) a simple script a simple trigger like that obviously the issue you're going to run into is well what if you sit there

(26:37) killing mobs and then you run out of HP and then you just die right you're not at your computer your trigger is still firing and then you just die because

(26:42) you're Auto killing mobs and um so obviously this is a problem but

(26:49) every single time you enter a command uh you have a prompt that comes back that gives you your HP and everything so what

(26:54) you can do is you can make that trigger conditional on your health points right and so I remember the first one

(27:01) that I set up because I didn't understand um I don't even know what you called it I think it used leis scripting actually funnily enough even though I

(27:07) don't even know what that is anymore um but you would so initially bro I remember some of those if I could go

(27:12) back and dig through some of my first like fullon like you call it bing when you could fully automate a character

(27:18) because I didn't know how to do like a like less than like a certain value so I would have like a script that would match it would be a trigger that would

(27:25) say like like if HP equals 30 if HP equals 29 if HP equals 28 if HP equals

(27:30) 27 matching all the way down to one and then if my HP hit any of these then it would deactivate the one triggers and

(27:37) then it would Auto it would spam FL FL for flea in case you got you were in combat initially it would just walk to

(27:42) the health clinic but then I realized I came back one time my character was dead I was like oh I was in combat when that trigger activated so I would have

(27:48) to flee first um so you would spam flee 20 times so that you made sure that that actually went through and then you would

(27:54) go um yeah it was just like a whole bunch of like autistic like trying to script like all these things and then eventually I like oh you can do like a

(28:00) range oh there are like wild cards that you can match um and eventually there's just like this full-on system of like if

(28:06) I've seen this particular thing in a room that it means my character has walked into the health clinic which means I know that I need to sleep and

(28:12) then I need to pause for like 4 minutes because a tick was 60 seconds and you would regenerate 25% of your HP in 60

(28:18) seconds and then after 4 minutes you would wake up it would be like de like you go down and then East like seven

(28:23) times and you go to the next Arena it was like all this like scripting out like this fully boded character so if you have enough triggers to like

(28:29) fully automated character You' call it bing okay well the issue was that boding is um and all the mods that I played was

(28:35) Mega illegal so then so then what you try to script around is if you were willing to lose a lot of characters and

(28:42) then you would go to these websites I don't even know why these existed but um I don't think vpns did they exist back

(28:48) then you would use these things called like socks 5 or sock 4 proxies so what you would do is you would find random

(28:54) proxies online You' plug them into mush client so that you could create a new character so if they IP band you could make a new one and

(29:01) um so what I what you had to start programming and by the time I got to like trying to survive admin encounters

(29:06) what you would try to do is you would try to program a script that would survive an encounter with an admin so

(29:12) like an admin would uh teleport to you and then they would ask you questions like Hello to see if you're there and so

(29:18) you would try to have scripts to respond to different admin promps and so initially um they were like my first few

(29:24) were obviously very crude but like I mean I pretty quickly that like they have to be relative sophisticated so you would program like um you could have

(29:31) like a random like like choose a value randomly between like 2 and 10 and like that's a value in seconds and then that

(29:36) would respond to something the guy said so that you're not responding instantaneously so that it's not automatically assumed to be a bot um I

(29:41) would have to think like social engineering like what are they going to ask so what can I respond with and how can I say a thing or whatever um some

(29:47) points I would put um I had like a random like before I would go to school for the day I would like uh insert

(29:53) because I could I could set messages to go off in like 4 hours so I would type in the ooc the out of character ch channel so that it would seem like I'm

(29:59) here on like chatting and it was just like the like one of the proudest moments of my life is when I came back to uh when I came home one day and I saw

(30:06) that my character had survived like a whole eight hour bot session and he was still fighting he wasn't like

(30:11) stuck on a wall or like some dumb and uh was and oh no it was when it

(30:16) survived that and it had survived an admin encounter they called him IM in mugs they called him Immortal so I scrolled up and I saw an immortal come

(30:22) down and chat with me and my character had gone back like two or three lines of text and then he just like teleported away if he would have sat and had like a

(30:27) longer then he would have caught him obviously I it wasn't like a it wasn't a  llm okay it was like 2008

(30:39) but but the um the problem solving for those for that scripting was just it was

(30:44) very fun it was interesting like sometimes I would be like I go into the same room and I can't think of any way to get my character to acknowledge

(30:50) whether I've come or gone for some reason so what I would do is like for some problems what I would do is I would drop an item in the room every time I

(30:57) enter and I would pick the item up every time I left so I could tell if I entered a room that I was there and I hadn't

(31:02) left it or whatever because there' be an item laying on the ground there' be like a ton of like little problem solving things like that it was just like fun to figure out autistic

(31:12) [Applause]

(31:25) I didn't realize play people played M until 8 I was in full wow addiction by then oh yeah I never actually wanted to

(31:31) play muds I just I really like Gundam Wing and I think I Yahoo searched like Gundam Wing game and then I found a um I

(31:39) found it was a I don't remember who even made that mud that I played but I found a game and I was on tnet for so long playing this game and then I um I just

(31:48) played it for a while assuming that at some point I tried to download like gud and zmud but these were too I was like

(31:53) was was I like like 14 13 I just didn't understand the I thought I just couldn't find like the graphics section

(32:00) so I thought I was just playing like a gimped version of the game with no graphics and just like a command prompt

(32:05) but at some point I was like I'll figure out how to like get the graphics

(32:10) working oh oh somebody just said that this mud thing sound so much like Beyond

(32:15) that's actually a thing I did try to learn um because that one game load Wars I wanted to make my own uh version of it because I was like the programmer

(32:21) left cuz he's a jerk um and I actually I did try to learn um Beyond has it own

(32:28) scripting language and I did try to learn that to make a game too I think I spent like 2 months building there was

(32:33) some rudimentary game where I had a guy that would like run around and like it sounds stupid but You' just be so happy

(32:40) when like oh my God like wall Collision Works he's not going through the walls anymore or just like dumb

(32:45) like that

(32:52) but where are these oh

(33:04) your one-on-one voice trans debates lately have gone well don't cancel voice trans debates

(33:16) what that's the guy you

(33:25) banned I did Python and uni for a module to create a game forgotten it all

(33:36) nice oh he's the meme from the clip the GU I got

(33:43) understand something I feel that has been missing from your analysis recently is how we Dems should balance technocracy versus populism we may have

(33:49) the right policies but if we can't convince voters that our policy of the best doesn't not leave a populist approach like there's

(33:57) the OBS plugin work right now yes the one that I have right now works very well I'm very happy um the

(34:05) um the issue right now it's it's it's easy but it's not simple or it's simple

(34:11) but it's not easy we just have to fix the media environment and I think everything else will function well again

(34:17) because people aren't stupid right you've watched me do you've watched me do these debates

(34:23) on I like how these screws don't go all the way in you watched me do these debates now on Twitter spaces these

(34:28) people will come like memorizing a ton of random facts and whatever data points so it's not like they don't

(34:35) have the capacity for it it's just that they've been fed so much horrible

(34:41) information um and if the media environment was just better it would just be so like our citizens are

(34:47) decently smart like having them like be screaming like real facts and real figures at each other um that are

(34:53) actually happening would just be so much more productive but our our media environment is just

(34:58) it's

(35:08) if we win one election we're free I hope Trump trumpism doesn't remain we H we have to fix the media it's it

(35:14) is right now we have to change people's views though on um on freedom

(35:21) of speech we have to view it like every other right that we have um and every other privilege that we have and that

(35:28) it's a right to be like cherished and protected and one and the one of the most important ways that you protect and

(35:35) cherish a right is to wield it responsibly um that's true of every

(35:41) single thing you're granted in life every new privilege every new thing comes with its own set of responsibilities it's just always true

(35:51) um you it's like it reminds me of like what Uncle Ben said to Spider-Man when they were in New York um when he he was

(35:57) saying like only save white people because 133% of the no I'm just I'm just kid I'm just

(36:05) kid is there a topic you and Alex Conor disagree on that you didn't get to talk about in the video

(36:11) um I don't Pro I'm sure there are tons

(36:17) but the the correct information is usually available though the problem just ignore all that information that doesn't confirmed to their narrative

(36:22) well yeah but I mean like people are only going to like people consume information based on the media environments that they're in right

(36:28) feel like we should just go back to the electors who think they should be president the problem is is very very

(36:35) very few people are immune to that type of media environment bias and electors

(36:41) would be no no like there's no reason to assume they would be insulated from it

(36:47) anym than I mean look at all these Tech Bros right that are that seem to be decently smart I'm

(36:53) glad I am glad I feel like people think I ask these questions and I'm just looking to like soy out and on

(36:58) people um but I really was looking for something to show me that like Does Elon Musk actually know anything about

(37:04) anything or is this just another  that got lucky um but after watching that the uh one of those rocket

(37:09) videos yesterday I was like okay never mind Elon actually seems like he knows a lot about Rockets I feel good about that that's good okay I'm glad um but then

(37:16) that it also furthers the point of like like he seems like he's decently smart here he has a good understand here like how did he get so Hoodwinked into the magga unfortunately with Elon it

(37:23) might be a bit more Insidious because he might just be looking to expand his

(37:30) power also the irony of how are we going to fix government inefficiency by creating a whole new office a whole new

(37:37) Department with a whole new staff it's going to need its own budget and everything else is the irony is not lost

(37:43) I me but

(38:03) what about instead of a direct vote for the president or that only states can so more indirect you can't

(38:10) um I I don't think you can um we have to fix the problem we can't

(38:16) just try to mask it with a with a different system I'm an airline pilot instructor and I 100% believe Elon Musk was just

(38:22) saying very common basic Pilots so s smart I don't think not to knock your profession or anything but I don't think that Pilots learn anything about like

(38:30) the efficiency and cost of composite materials for surviving atmospheric rantry not listen I've never been

(38:35) through pilot school but I would be surprised if you guys learned how long would it take for a 747

(38:40) to burn up in the atmosphere if you were trying to uh cruise at 990,000

(38:53) FT are you excited for antiva or RFK Jr running the health department under trp yeah I don't know man is it not equally

(39:00) possible that he just memorized that stuff he wasn't talking to Rocket experts the whole facade broke for you when he talked about coding with a coder

(39:05) yeah but that's just an example I don't know why people can't do this that was an example of him stepping I don't think he knows anything about programming or

(39:11) AI uh maybe somebody can show me another video to convince me of that actually that I maybe I'm wrong there but what I've heard him talk about like when I

(39:17) when he's talked about like Twitter or when he's talked about AI he sounds like a he sounds like a crypto bro Layman

(39:22) who's just like oh here's some of the cool buzzword I learned um but the rocket stuff that he was talking about

(39:27) that didn't sound like a memorized or rehearsed thing it sounded like he had a genuine understanding because he was going from concept to example to concept

(39:34) to example like and he was fluidly understanding and he was responsive to the questions like that that seemed like

(39:41) like the guy said the guy prompted like why don't you get into the nitty-gritty as much as you can and then he did that's very rare to that somebody has

(39:47) any idea what the they're talking about um well I shouldn't say that actually CU he's like a he was a business guy not just like a random

(39:53) politician dude so he should have know what he was talking about he's literally the founder of SpaceX he should know what he talk about but um yeah I I think

(39:58) he did I don't think um people bring up the

(40:05) PayPal I don't think musk had anything to do with PayPal I'm pretty sure that's some Stolen Valor um I'd have to go look I'm just ripping this

(40:11) from the Wikipedia article but it sounded like musk was an early investor in the company PayPal but it was back

(40:18) when PayPal was only going to be used for was it just transactions or it was

(40:23) just something else um it wasn't even like the iteration of PayPal that it was today and he sold his shares in PayPal

(40:28) before it became what it was today so the idea that like musk built PayPal was his first company is just not true um he

(40:34) he was just like an early investor and then he sold out before it in like what was it like 2001 I think it was a long

(40:40) time ago that might have

(40:46) been why do I keep leaving these here you think it can be brain Rod of

(40:53) ignorance instead of maliciousness well I mean like mus is making calls about Trump four years ago that seemed

(41:03) like he wrote the whole code for zip 2 and a lot of PayPal originally I would

(41:08) be shocked if that was the case um but I mean I'm open to being wrong if that is the case I'm going to say listening to

(41:14) him talk to that one Dev about PayPal um it was really painful it was really it was

(41:21) that was some that was some Primo Kino  that was like a why do you

(41:27) get so mad when management tries to direct your projects or whatever and it's like because of stuff like this and

(41:32) then you would roll the clip of Elon talking about how PayPal needs a complete and total refactor without

(41:38) having any idea what the problems even are um or even being able to name any of the problems um yeah I don't know that

(41:43) just sounded Mega so if he has a background there that would be pretty surprising not impossible but Twitter sorry not

(41:51) PayPal do I have everything in here power supply Ram CPU

(41:57) GPU I put in the capture card should be

(42:07) fine I think Elon wants a Russian style oligarchy where people like him have significant power over government I don't think his Magus is ideological oh

(42:13) like oh that's I never thought of that he wants to be like oligarchical he would be an oligarchical person right I

(42:19) mean like he would be he'd be part of the oligarchy

(42:49) exactly my understanding is he wrote some amount of code that was immediately thrown out and then pretty much never coded again based okay SL highlight

(42:56) destiny oh true I when it comes to like writing good code or being a good programmer I think that's I think that's

(43:02) always I think the the the assumption is that like like a good programmer is somebody

(43:08) who's memorized like every every language and they've memorized every function and they don't have to tab complete anything because they just know

(43:14) how to type everything in the IDE or whatever but I'm pretty sure it's just like like the mind you have for conceptualizing like problem solving and

(43:21) and like organizational like structure and all of that is so like the idea of like oh this guy's a good programmer

(43:27) it's like well why is that like he never has to open the manual he like

(43:36) no oh one of the things that um Elon said about engineering that I super agree with um it might be a common thing

(43:42) maybe a lot of Engineers or business people talk about whatever but it's the idea of um getting trapped in iterating

(43:48) on something that you should be eliminating and that you should be like it's okay to eliminate things and then add them back as you need them rather

(43:54) than being that's a good point um I've learned that over the past few years of things sometimes you're wasting

(44:00) time trying to endlessly iterate on a thing that you should just be getting rid of um

(44:09) okay here come come with me on this

(44:17) camera well let's let's lens swap

(44:28) is that a shoes or a smoke detector oh these are my shoes I need it on the uh on the court whenever I'm breaking knees I want people to hear my shoes against

(44:35) the ground do you think the smart things El

(44:40) says he just stole from one of his smart employees um I think you can steal you can steal slogans but it's hard to steal

(44:47) like concepts of um things that like I don't know how to explain this to you I

(44:53) don't know how to explain it I'm sorry if somebody came came in and somebody like oh you know what you want

(44:59) a good example of like uh something you learned or memorized was when Marco Rubio when Marco Rubio was repeating

(45:06) that same line over and over again when Chris chrisy was like all he has is the memorize talking points that's a good example of only having a thing that an

(45:13) employee told you but let's say that an employee told Elon something let's say

(45:18) that an employee told Elon something and then when Elon is answering questions they were all things that he was briefed

(45:23) about before if Elon is able to incorporate what his employee told him in a way into the answer of the question

(45:30) that shows he has at least like a rudimentary understanding of what he was told that counts that's that's good enough for me that's that's totally fine

(45:39) um like I I don't think that that is at the level of just Mindless regurgitation like it shows like it's it's okay that

(45:46) like an employee briefs you on something before you go to a meeting and then maybe even something you didn't fully understand before but if you have the the mind because there's going to be

(45:52) like some base level of conceptualization to understand what's even being told to you at all so I think that's totally

(45:57) okay I wouldn't hold that against

(46:08) anybody o this going to be really

(46:19) dark and a video YouTuber asked a question somebody Tex about the rocket that El hadn't considered before

(46:25) wait and El had said before you seem real time realize it's a good idea and immediately has changes made to the rocket show pretty understand what's

(46:30) going on okay yeah that wouldn't surprise

(46:39) me how come you don't look at how other democracies avoid populism so should stay healthy like Taiwan vers Taiwan thing uh I don't know um after World War

(46:47) I and World War II we'll get into that okay

(47:00) it cannot possibly be the case that the only way to change profiles on mobile stream deck is to change profiles on

(47:06) your computer right that would just be absolutely  absurd

(47:14) right I think that is the only way to do it

(47:30) I think the um the solution would just be to make different folders instead of different

(47:37) profiles so you can access it all on the same profile how

(47:42) crazy Andrew wants to chat at 3:30 yeah no

(47:54) problem is Dean coming to the election um I don't think so

(48:01) now I I don't know he wants to ask me about the fascism stuff you know what and I'm like it I probably took my

(48:07) V an hour before yes that's why I said yes I'm in a good mood you think after the Congressional

(48:14) letter other twitch streamers will no longer collab with hasanabi

(48:20) um people are very very very simple if you're ever trying to figure out why people do what they do the answer is

(48:26) usually just people follow incentives um people will continue to follow H and do whatever Hass wants as long as he has an

(48:33) audience and as long as he doesn't get banned so the question is is Will twitch ban it for anything and if they won't

(48:39) then nobody will uh stop supporting

(48:47) hassabi wait did Adam actually back out of the election stream with sitch

(48:58) that congressman is from the poorest District in America I'm sorry but why is this his priority I don't know what the  else it's probably one of the things that he can make like the biggest

(49:04) movements on right like as an individual Congressman you can't really do much wait if that's true uh I don't know

(49:11) if s is listening you can DM me on Twitter or whatever I would 100% invite you

(49:18) um that dude from louder with Crowder won the lawsuit the not Jared guy oh  what was that lawsuit about again

(49:24) who did I predict would win did I make a predic [Applause]

(49:38) what can somebody explain to me why so many people break tempered glass I feel like I see so many post on like the PC

(49:43) Building sear where there's like shattering their tempered glass covers

(49:49) and I don't know why I don't know what's happening there

(50:03) is that the couch you guys got it sucks that couch is awesome what do you mean I paid $5,000 for

(50:10) it um no that's not the couch I got uh that that comes tomorrow I'm

(50:17) probably throwing this one out this thing is a piece of an is like falling

(50:24) apart I have like um I have my Old Reliable gray screwdriver somewhere and I've lost it I don't know

(50:30) where it is it bothers me greatly God this room is so organized holy

(50:37) who organized this room all the cases are right here power stuff cabling

(50:43) for audio um multi oh my God this is amazing extra stands all my ND filter

(50:50) Jesus good job whoever whoever did this A+ A+ to you my friend

(50:58) friend oh throw away all my vacuums I also

(51:03) ordered I ordered a beast vacuum I think does VI an with your recreational

(51:08) drug use scheduling I.E serotonin syndrome nobody that talks about serotonin syndrome is getting serotonin syndrome okay people use it as a

(51:14) shorthand of I feel bad because I'm not high anymore and I didn't get good sleep um if you actually have serotonin

(51:19) syndrome that's like a it can be like a life-threatening condition um that's but that's a different thing

(51:26) that doesn't just come from doing a little bit too much MDMA be careful with your

(51:31) drugs I got a a sibo automatic X4

(51:38) upright vacuum cleaner it's funny I said this before but I was worried I was

(51:43) talking because I it's been a long time since I've carpet cleaned but I said a long time ago I said that uh for carpet cleaning

(51:50) there were like all of these vacuums that people get all these crazy Dyson and but none of them were ever as good as I really basic just like dual

(51:56) motor uprights they like those were just the best vacuums always and so I was Googling around for like what are the best vacuums and this is what I came up

(52:04) with people were like this guy is wait where am I is the

(52:09) dominant Supreme vacuum oh my

(52:19) God but it's $800 so I can't wait to vacuum the I'm

(52:27) GNA suck my dick with that

(52:32) vacuum what about a shop vac um shop backs are good when you just need to  vacuum up like garage uh I

(52:39) don't know if I would ever use a shop facts don't usually come with the spinning bristles to like work through

(52:46) carpet or whatever or at least I haven't seen any shot backs with that kind of 

(52:52) but a good shop vac is so nice when you're doing a lot of work

(52:57) um if you're like working on like drywall or what I'm sure there's like a ton of other you for but having a good shop back where you can just stick that

(53:03) sucker in the corner suck everything up it's so

(53:09) nice what am I doing oh I feel so lonely out here I can't see you guys I have no

(53:14) chat I'm lost I'm lost to the world

(53:32) why did you really use this photo I don't know I keep saying I should go get photos done I could probably just take photos of myself though I like I have a

(53:38) studio right there's no reason to have dumb photos the ones that Tom got of me were really good but I can just like take those I just

(53:43) recreate those I don't know much about photography but I feel like I have enough camera background that I should be able to figure it

(53:54) out okay Google glasses doesn't have chat in your eyeball true we had a professional cleaner do our carpets and

(53:59) I was not impressed they didn't vacuum before they started stating it would be fine it wasn't horrible I was also not impressed it wasn't the big clean I was

(54:08) expecting wait are you with me wait are you like a 15-year-old

(54:20) viewer that was a Google revieww oh okay

(54:28) by the time by the end of my like carpet cleaning days on that job I started to shortcut the out of everything I it

(54:34) took me too long to figure out how people actually made money doing contract work um when you work for small

(54:39) businesses CU I was naive and stupid and I'd only worked for like McDonald's and the casino and the the World Herald like

(54:44) having my paper R and so I didn't know how you made money as a contractor um and I just stopped giving a at the end so I would skip as many steps as

(54:51) possible I would skip as many steps as possible and hell yeah why would I vacuum I've got this uh I've got this

(54:58) whole ass uh water mount system for my truck I'll just water and vacuum

(55:04) it up with the with the hose on the machine I'm not going to vacuum this  first Dean said he's been talking to

(55:11) Hassan a lot oh rip that's probably why he's not coming

(55:21) on that employee yeah at the end of that job I was a dog employee that

(55:27) I'm a I'm a ride or die um DG there go oh I don't need this

(55:37) anymore I read YouTube chat at all uh it's over there but it's not on my iPad right

(55:44) now it's history Bachelor slmp on the table after the election you create a thesis pro project for your trip and

(55:50) research about I I slightly considered um

(55:57) law school I think litigating would actually be so much fun and watching all

(56:02) the court and the trial I honest to God I feel like um I feel like there is a huge overlap mentally um

(56:10) between the skill set required to do litigation and the skill sets involved

(56:15) in uh software development uh you like you have like you've got a whole set of

(56:21) pre-existing rules that's basically like your your your programming language um and then you have like a problem that

(56:28) you're trying to solve for right so like you're building an application to do a particular thing um or in a legal case

(56:33) you're trying to win a particular you're trying to win like a particular case you have to build like a legal theory for

(56:39) how you're going to win the case which is kind of like macro like what do we want this program to do what's the scope of the project um and and then you yeah

(56:47) I guess for coding you put in the code you run it you see if it works um you could even probably find analogs

(56:53) to like like is a lawy or if you get the the law wrong like if you something up it's like a like a what is it like a

(57:00) compiling error versus if you try to do something in court that is legally okay but it like is wrong it doesn't do what you want it's like a runtime eror like I

(57:06) I feel like there's actually I feel like there's a lot of analog to the type of problem solving um just the whole idea of like here's a set of facts like build

(57:12) a case around this and then argue it in front of a judge or jury I don't know I like the I like the concept of it and I

(57:18) like the concept of like an actual graded debate that's not up for popular

(57:24) uh popular uh it's not just like who has the most comments in the YouTube section or like that um

(57:31) yeah I don't know I really like that same thing with being a doctor oh yeah that sounds cool too I have a friend who

(57:37) she does internal medicine um and she was describing that she said she liked Internal Medicine more than a lot of the

(57:42) other disciplines because getting she said I think she said most of the cases are obviously they're very boring people come in with a stomach pain and they

(57:48) have like a stomach ache but they like solving cases or figuring out stuff like that can be can be fun but it's not as

(57:54) common when you get your undergrad yeah that's why I decided that cuz I'm never I'm never going to school to get an undergrad that I ain't got time

(58:01) for that and I don't even know how much my college would carry over I would have to go and look all that and all

(58:09) that how would you feel about advocating for someone who is wrong you'd have to do the best to represent them no

(58:14) remember when you're representing somebody it's not about being right or wrong when it comes to criminal matters

(58:19) it's about forcing the state to prove their case and that is always that is a noble thing to force state to do you

(58:27) don't want to have situations where where you get like OJ Simpsons where the state is framing somebody for

(58:34) murder who committed murder just like it's good to make you should make the state prove their case that's good

(58:40) that's a noble thing to do you should want the state to have to do

(58:53) that why would you want to get an undergrad giving your position uh well you need an undergrad in order to get

(59:01) um in order to go to law school

(59:13) right you said which is more likely if your son get killed in a school shooting or killed by an illegal immigrant did you really know the stats oh no I have

(59:19) no idea what's more likely I feel like both of those are in extremely rare killed by an illegal immigr versus

(59:26) killed by um versus killed in a school

(59:32) shooting I my guess would be cuz both of these events are probably incredibly rare events in life would be my guess my

(59:39) guess is it' probably be more likely to be killed in a school shooting just because it's a bit more like sectioned off in society or actually it might be

(59:47) more likely to get killed by an illegal immigrant just because car accidents are more popular popular I should that are

(59:52) more common and maybe illegal immigrants and car maybe so maybe it be immigrant I'm not sure

(1:00:04) but y Destiny how did your ad medicine improve in real life life got any worthy examples bro if you watched my stream my

(1:00:09) whole life has changed I don't think I need to I could be the spokesperson for ADHD medication all

(1:00:15) right as I wander aimlessly around here not sure what I should

(1:00:21) do okay this table needs to be moved that's what we're doing right now

(1:00:36) what would be your solution to gun deaths um I don't know probably I feel like it's people killing themselves in gang is like the most common

(1:00:43) ways but so you deal with those two things

(1:00:48) rather than freaking out over guns I don't know hold on I'm backing this room there's a ton of trash in here

(1:01:01) that's not me that's a

(1:01:14) b oh me I'm also thinking today of like should I just say it and

(1:01:21) buy the um buy some Newman condensers I feel like people can't use those SM 7bs I

(1:01:28) don't know if I should like have a um should I have like a 4minute sit down

(1:01:34) before a show and I'm like Hey listen these mics only work if you speak right into them and if you don't speak right

(1:01:39) into them it's going to be not good [Applause]

(1:02:10) I think that the um why not switch everybody to a lab mic yeah you could it's not as great for audio quality but

(1:02:16) maybe it would just be better just say  it and just use labs to everybody

(1:02:27) I still think you mount them horizontally but facing slightly upwards is the best solution maybe I don't

(1:02:36) know I think that um the problem is if I get the newans I

(1:02:42) already know the issue that I'm going to run into if I get the condenser mics my auto switcher is not going to work as

(1:02:47) well because the audio is going to bleed over so hard uh to the other side of the table I won't I'll never be able to set

(1:02:53) the sensitivity correctly for the auto switcher to work so I'm pretty sure switching to a mic like that would break it completely I feel like if we used all

(1:03:00) Labs I'm also not sure if that would break it as

(1:03:06) well you seem annoyed last night what was going on um was I annoyed last

(1:03:12) night what was going on everybody showed up late that triggered me after the election I'm going to start

(1:03:19) riding hardcore we're going to be doing a lot of Internal Documentation

(1:03:26) I got a I got in my brain I'll figure it

(1:03:32) [Applause] out for me too though not not just other

(1:03:40) people I think Behavior generally comes from the top down to some

(1:03:47) extent so if people aren't doing correct  usually you can trace that up

(1:03:53) through the top

(1:04:01) what do I even want this guy to be I'm trying to think of what this room is going to look like I have a big sectional I've got an

(1:04:08) L couch it's going to be a couch here or over here the L could be here and

(1:04:14) sitting like this and then coffee

(1:04:20) table do I want him to be closer or further away

(1:04:28) if I put an L couch here it's nice because I can hide all the cabling behind the divider actually that's prob

(1:04:34) oh but if I put the computer desk there I can plug that in where it needs to

(1:04:48) be honestly if you get two condensers say room mates and point them at a 90° angle each other might be best ah room

(1:04:53) makes like that are they sound very it'll sound very echoey like I can turn the shotguns on on these cameras and

(1:04:58) they're it's not that

(1:05:05) good do you have any non-regular orbiters coming for stream um oh

(1:05:11) Andrew's ready I think the actman is coming and

(1:05:17) then some of the commentary guys are okay am I really going to be able to

(1:05:23) hear him am I really going be able to have a Discord call on this

(1:05:30) computer here we go good

(1:05:35) luck hello hello hey what's up man can you hear me okay oh yeah can you hear me are you there

(1:05:46) hold on testing one two check check NOP hold on wait one I I uh got no audio coming

(1:05:54) in from you oh okay wait wait one second all right laptop Discord no problem testing hello let's see what do

(1:06:01) I want to send him laptop dis is analog 5 and

(1:06:11) six user settings voice video analog 56

(1:06:17) input oh that should be working why is it not working oh I know why it's not working

(1:06:23) it's because this device is a physical out instead of a software out I could

(1:06:28) change it but I have to remember to change it back oh am I going to  myself if I do

(1:06:35) that I'll remember remind me to change this back please remind me to rewire Hardware to software output after this

(1:06:42) okay can you hear me right now hello yeah I can hear you okay okay I

(1:06:48) got my camera on too if you want to if you if you need it for your stream

(1:06:53) um that's too complicated that what's it what's that what I miss

(1:07:00) this I I'm in my studio right now it's too complicated to we that like that but okay yeah yeah yeah no problem no

(1:07:05) problem so I wanted to uh because we were on the Jubilee I was I was watching

(1:07:10) it this morning the release episode and I don't know what your takes are on on that but uh that was not a place which

(1:07:16) was really conducive for debate it was basically a place that's conducive for shouting matches um so I I kind of went through

(1:07:26) uh your um your take on this and I'm actually still confused because I think

(1:07:32) it's important when you're debating with people and I and I kind of Bank on this that I understand their worldview or

(1:07:39) else there's no real way for me to even engage with what they're saying so I was hoping we could just revisit that

(1:07:45) conversation and we could just chat about it I'm not not here to debate broya none of that I just actually kind of genuinely want to understand the

(1:07:51) position um yeah sure what's the well so uh this was maybe maybe like two

(1:07:58) years ago uh maybe three you you were on a panel with vosch I don't know if you remember this conversation I think it

(1:08:04) was on you're going to bring up the one about uh him calling Scalia a fascist I think and Bush fascist right yeah yep

(1:08:10) yep and you you kind of were you went off on him about it and you were saying hey look uh you know this is this

(1:08:16) basically and I'm paraphrasing right I don't remember the conversation verbatim but it was something like you know everybody on the left calls everybody on

(1:08:22) the right a fascist and a Nazi and a this and a that and um you know like you you basically kind

(1:08:29) of kind of went off on him by asking him to just kind of Define what a fascist even is and he really wasn't able to um

(1:08:36) and so you know I I just wanted you to elaborate because Trump being a fascist he's a lot of things I understand your

(1:08:42) rationale for most of the things you call Trump I can at least understand it if that makes sense I can understand how

(1:08:47) you got there um but not the fascist thing that I can't that I don't understand sure so I mean like here's

(1:08:55) like so here's one thing I will say at the start um I feel like fascism is a

(1:09:00) very normatively loaded word such that when people hear it it just means kind of bad um yeah AG yeah so there's that

(1:09:07) but I think that um one of the reasons why I got mad at vosch in that conversation about calling scalar Bush a

(1:09:13) fascist is because you call everybody a fascist you can't really use the word anymore it loses its power um which is where I'm at now obviously because if I

(1:09:19) call anybody fascist it's leftist have been calling everybody fascist for every uh for all the time or whatever so it's like okay well now it sounds like I'm so

(1:09:25) you're kind of in the same the same boat right well that's I mean I mean I didn't I don't think Scalia or bush were

(1:09:30) fascists but um the uh when I so when I think of fascist the

(1:09:36) two prongs that I'm usually thinking of um are the ultra nationalist part and

(1:09:42) then the authoritarian part and I view both of these things as being like hyper exaggerated aspects or elements of

(1:09:49) populism uh we can go into either Peg of that if you want yeah yeah well uh to

(1:09:55) kind of start with I'm just wondering and we had kind of touched on this a little bit at Jubilee but have you have

(1:10:02) you talked to any of the third well you have you've debated with a couple of third positionist I know politically provoke set some up for you with um what

(1:10:09) was his name um talked to third positionist before yeah yeah you've talked to third positionist before so I

(1:10:16) mean you have a pretty good grounding of what I mean these guys are like em embedded in the ideology of fascism like

(1:10:22) they're they know it inside and out Keith Woods all those those guys know have you have you kind of dove into any

(1:10:28) of that at all um not really I don't not not what they say in particular no yeah so they're when they're saying fascism

(1:10:35) they're talking about the corporatism which is the idea that the body of the state is made up of corporate entities

(1:10:42) and that those corporate entities are there on behalf of the state and move on

(1:10:47) behalf of the state as the body of the state and um that's that so that's what

(1:10:53) what they mean when they say fascism they're at what musolini and Franco Spain meant by fascism so I understand

(1:10:59) you might have your own definition but maybe that's what I'm kind of trying to dive into a little bit um I mean like that might be the case I I think maybe

(1:11:05) historically in the first parts of like when fascism was kind of a thing that's I think that's how it was understood

(1:11:11) right like I think I could be making this up but wasn't the term privatization invented for like Hitler like privatizing and then deploying like

(1:11:17) corporate entities in in Nazi Germany or whatever for the state I'm not I'm not sure if that's where the term privatization came from but I can I know

(1:11:24) but I do know for sure that um uh what fascism was because they were all the

(1:11:29) the guys who invented fascism came out of communist Theory and communism wasn't working for Italy and fascism was

(1:11:36) actually a response to Communism and so that's that's the idea was to stop large

(1:11:41) trade syndicates from swallowing up small trade syndicates essentially that's what uh now that's an

(1:11:47) oversimplification but that's that's kind of what fascist Theory and third positionism is but you I mean you just

(1:11:53) kind of mean something totally different by it it sounds like uh I mean like I said those are the two pegs that I judge

(1:11:59) it on historically might have had a different definition that's totally possible um I mean if somebody wants to fight me on the definition of fascism I

(1:12:06) would probably just immediately concede because that's not the most interesting part to me kind of like how like if I'm

(1:12:12) debating somebody who wants to argue about communism depending on how obstinate I'm being I'm not going to start screaming at the person well

(1:12:17) actually communism implies uh paperless stateless society so you're totally wrong with you because when they say communism usually what they just mean is like really huge overreach of government

(1:12:23) and maybe like high taxes or whatever you know so I just yeah oh yeah yeah you mean like the the conservative Spurs who

(1:12:29) are like um every everybody's a communist and everything's a communist if the government's involved at all it's

(1:12:35) communist like that type of thing so I probably like I would just argue with people about okay what when what are you arguing like is the government

(1:12:41) experience you're bad or whatever it just but it depends on the style of the conversation I guess yeah yeah so when you say okay so I think I think we're

(1:12:48) getting some clarification here so you mean when you say um fascism your

(1:12:53) meaning is a historical standard which applies to authoritarianism and protectionism right is that is that cor

(1:13:00) kind of correct yeah kind of protectionism being like one of the legs of the hyper or the like the the hyper

(1:13:06) Ultra nationalism whatever yeah yeah well how would you then because like a

(1:13:11) guy like vosch would agree with this he would agree that these are at least legs of fascism um and I I think I would even

(1:13:18) agree that this could be considered a leg of fascism if you're saying there's multiple pillars that hold up a fascist

(1:13:23) system I think that authoritarianism and protectionism could easily be kind of related into two of those legs but then

(1:13:30) how would you kind of push back against a guy like Vos if he when he's calling basically all right-wingers fascist

(1:13:36) because they do want a degree of authoritarianism I think leftists do too to a degree and they do want um they do

(1:13:43) want to have some type of protectionism at least tariffs they seem to be for that and this type of thing but I mean

(1:13:48) when he that isn't that exactly kind of what you were going off on him about though right I mean like the reality is

(1:13:54) is every single thing in life exists on a spectrum whether you're talking about like well maybe not everything I guess

(1:14:00) somebody's dead they not but like you know if we're talking about like mental illness like how may Spectrum sure I

(1:14:06) don't know anyway go ahead like like what is it democracy like a lot of people right now will ARG I don't know if you say I'm

(1:14:12) trying to like start an argue on this but some people will say like oh America's not a democracy because we don't like directly vote on every single

(1:14:17) thing it's like okay well that's not really true but um or like is um is a particular thing like a authoritarian

(1:14:25) authoritarianism exists on a on a spectrum you know if you were to go to the wandering tribes of the Middle East

(1:14:30) prior to the establishment of any states like to them every single government is going to be authoritarian because these

(1:14:35) people have ultimate freedom to do whatever they want and anybody telling them you can or can't do anything is going to feel authoritarian right so I

(1:14:41) mean it all exists on a spectrum so I guess when I'm as an American citizen with an American tradition in history

(1:14:46) when I talk about authoritarianism my perspective was probably going to be compared to what I think the intention

(1:14:52) and and the ordinary operation of the US system is is I would say that uh Trump is an authoritarian is what I would say

(1:14:59) yeah so I can understand the idea of how you got to authoritarianism with the separate slave of electors this type of

(1:15:05) thing I get I get that like I can understand the rationale but in this I

(1:15:11) largely agree with you if you're saying kind of everything's on a spectrum I could say the same thing about Christianity right there's Christian

(1:15:16) ethics there's lots of people who follow various forms of uh Christian ethics but I wouldn't call them Christians and I

(1:15:23) don't think that they would even identify as being Christians because it wouldn't fit the other criteria which

(1:15:28) are necessary and so I guess in this when you're talking about fascism if you say well these are two legs of fascism I

(1:15:36) think I could even agree that that's true I guess I guess the only thing that I would want some clarity on is like you

(1:15:42) wouldn't say Trump is a fascist though like just like I wouldn't say you are a

(1:15:48) Christian because you follow some forms of Christian ethics right there there would be other criteria there I mean I I

(1:15:54) mean guess it depends on the where it's I mean I feel like at this point it's a big semantic

(1:16:00) conversation not not that semantics are bad or not importants are essential but it's like whatever this like narrowing

(1:16:08) of the conversation would be would be a thing that I'm not as interested in if it was like a what is the historical

(1:16:14) tradition and definition of fascism and would XYZ leader qualify for it that's just a conversation I'm not generally

(1:16:21) having but if um generally when I say Trump is a fascist and then I say Trump I believe that he exhibits

(1:16:26) characteristics that are hyper Nationalist and Ultra authoritarian what I'm really saying when I say Trump is

(1:16:32) fascist is I'm emoting Donald Trump has tendencies that are far more authoritarian than what I think the US

(1:16:38) system was or should be designed for and Donald Trump has Ultra nationalist tendencies that go further and Beyond

(1:16:44) what a free liberal capitalist Society should be designing for is is really what I'm saying I guess yeah well I

(1:16:49) think I I understand all that too uh but to kind of narrow in on this right and I'm not trying to be overly semantic at

(1:16:55) all to be honest with you when itic I just mean defining words I don't think like arguing semantics is not necessarily bad it's I mean like it's

(1:17:02) essential no it's good it's good for for a conversation the thing is is that I get here's here's my disconnect you and

(1:17:09) I both know that the word fascist is a super loaded term now right politically

(1:17:15) it's a loaded loaded term that leftists essentially or left Wingers progressives liberals Democrats whatever you want to

(1:17:21) whatever kind of group you want to associate use this as a way to attack uh their opposition and they're basically

(1:17:28) calling them Nazis right that's that's basically what they're saying is when they say fascist they're using it as a

(1:17:34) um kind of intermediate to say you're Nazi So when you say What I'm trying I guess what I'm trying to get clarified

(1:17:39) is when you say Trump is a fascist right uh you you're kind of bringing all of

(1:17:45) that loaded terminology up into bear when it when it may not actually apply

(1:17:50) and I guess that's why that's why that uh particular position that you had it's the the other ones are all rational like

(1:17:57) all the positions you cat at Jubilee I thought were totally rational they made sense from your worldview that one

(1:18:02) doesn't seem that rational though that seems like you're just kind of using like rhetorically loaded language because it's super effective

(1:18:11) right yeah I mean I understand what you're saying the issue just comes to like what like I guess what do you want

(1:18:16) to fight over and what do you want to give up because I mean you should we all know this in this space that like technically every word and every

(1:18:23) definition and every thing is is so beyond like warped and

(1:18:28) stretched um there were some things that were part of the there was at least one thing that was part of the green New

(1:18:35) Deal um that was genuinely socialist um nobody talks about this

(1:18:40) because everything was socialist but if I'm not mistaken in part of the green New Deal Bernie Sanders um and AOC I

(1:18:47) think they work together on authoring this or maybe just I don't remember um part of the plan was to expropriate 20%

(1:18:53) of every single us Corporation and turn it over to the employees of those corporations that's an actual socialist

(1:18:59) policy that's not yeah I would say so yeah that's not like that's not just like a more government redistribution higher taxes that's like an actual

(1:19:05) socialist policy and I would say that as such I would say this is an actual socialist policy I don't know how I feel about this but like if I say that I know

(1:19:12) that now I'm going to have to fight through the um the definitions of everything but the issue is just like I

(1:19:18) like I don't like just giving up every single word because it's like well I can't talk about you know fascism I

(1:19:23) can't talk about socialism I can't talk about toxic masculinity or feminism or whatever the you want to say because everybody's like destroyed the

(1:19:29) the meanings of these words because theyve used them so much so I I guess like in my dream scenario I call Trump a fascist somebody says what do you mean

(1:19:35) by fascist and then I say these are the two legs of fascism and then we argue over whether or not Trump qualifies for

(1:19:40) that um but I don't know maybe I mean there could maybe be a better way to approach it but I don't know okay well

(1:19:47) like there's a bunch of normative baggage that gets Dragged In although some of that is intentional too like I want there I think that fascism is bad

(1:19:53) much the same that if I call somebody socialist or commun are tanky I also think that's bad and I'm trying to signal that too so maybe but when you

(1:19:59) were when you were in that vosch debate you made a good point that and you've made it before and I make it all the

(1:20:04) time as well which is that look uh even the bad guys sometimes do good things right so just saying hey this is a

(1:20:10) fascist policy or this or that doesn't even necessarily make make it a bad policy any more than there's probably

(1:20:16) some socialist policies that you might be able to get behind or you know that that type of thing just because bad guys

(1:20:22) also did thing doesn't mean thing bad uh you know kind of on its face so maybe

(1:20:28) even I would even go a step further and I would say that there are very few forms of economic or um economic or

(1:20:34) political organization that have like a normative value there there are probably some like I might maybe actually I don't

(1:20:40) know if I would say any because I was my example I was going to say maybe slavery is always bad but I don't know if that's true if we're talking about like let's

(1:20:46) say that uh like in the United States let's say that if you're um if you go to jail let's say that you can get out early if you agree to do 20 hours of

(1:20:53) community service like does that like I don't know maybe maybe well there's other forms of that too like for instance um if you're in a war with

(1:20:59) another nation and you're you know your option is to either you know take out the civilian population or enslave them

(1:21:06) would it be more optimal to enslave them that way they weren't at your back there's all sorts of ways I think we could make moral justifications for

(1:21:13) these things right sure yeah I try I try to it's impossible and it's completely futile but I try to tell people to

(1:21:18) divorce like don't just don't think about economics or governments like normatively but you can fight or or rather you can get normative value to

(1:21:25) them but you have to like build it up you can't just say it off hand like there are democracies that have been worse than some authoritarian regimes

(1:21:32) there have been republics that have been worse than monarchies like there's a lot of other stuff going on there yeah okay yeah so I can actually

(1:21:39) agree uh essentially with all this so maybe I guess now um that we're kind of

(1:21:45) on the same page these the so if if Trump does have these said kind of like

(1:21:51) um you know fascist style policies from from worldview uh I mean do you think that

(1:21:57) those are always bad like protectionist and tariffs for instance you don't think all tariffs are bad Biden has some right

(1:22:02) and I mean that's a that's a form of protectionism so there's there's some kind of threshold there obviously for

(1:22:08) when too much is too much right yeah so the issue this so we have to get into the Weeds on like econ stuff but the

(1:22:15) issue that I have when it comes to tariffs um is that tariffs when they're used they do particular things and they

(1:22:22) don't do other things and people aren't always honest about the things that they do and the things that they can't do um

(1:22:28) so then they lie about when they're putting tariffs on so for instance if somebody were to tell me we need to put tariffs on China when it comes to

(1:22:34) manufacturing microprocessors because if we went to war with China we're going to be if they like pull the plugin

(1:22:40) all that so if you want to say we should tariff to protect that industry what you're saying is is we need to have a tariff for national security purposes

(1:22:47) okay now that's a fine argument and I agree with that argument I think that's good there probably are some things that

(1:22:52) we should manufacture at home and event of War however if you try to pair that with saying well this is all going to be

(1:22:58) economically good at the same time well hold on that's probably not true if you're doing these tariffs for national security reasons they're probably not

(1:23:04) also going to be economically beneficial so we have to be honest about what we're doing like I don't think all protectionism is bad but there is a

(1:23:10) there's a macro theory of why you're protecting industry that can make me disagree with all of your tariffs even

(1:23:16) if some of the tariffs are good like if you're do you okay I understand what you're saying so so but but kind of on

(1:23:23) this this this is kind of moving against the view then I think a little bit so what you're saying is is like yeah of

(1:23:29) course there's there's times where protectionism is is totally appropriate totally fine in this case you site you

(1:23:34) could have some foreign adversary who you might potentially have war with and so you want to make sure that uh you

(1:23:40) know they're not making the very components which are going to go in the weapons that you're going to use to defeat them let's say uh so yeah

(1:23:46) absolutely but but on the other hand that could give us kind of a little bit of economic downturn fair enough I can

(1:23:53) agree with that too but the thing is is like so if Trump's idea here is to put

(1:23:58) these types of tariffs on um and you don't agree with them because you think there's going to be an economic downturn

(1:24:03) or perhaps you don't even agree that the people he's putting them on uh are potential enemies that doesn't seem

(1:24:09) still to me to be particularly authoritarian right that that just kind of seems like maybe you would think he

(1:24:15) was just a bumbling idiot right not not so much fascist authoritarian yeah sure so to be clear so two things so one

(1:24:22) nothing about the tariffs are technically itarian unless he tries to do all of it VI executive order that could be arguably authoritarian these

(1:24:28) would hope fall under the ultra nationalist part the reason why I oppose Trump and his tariffs um is because are

(1:24:34) you are you familiar with the term autarchy yeah yeah the idea seems to be

(1:24:39) that a good country is a country that has inh housed all of its Supply chains

(1:24:45) and I think that for a whole bunch of economic reasons that's really dumb I shouldn't say dumb I I just don't think

(1:24:51) that's possible and I think it hurts your economy overall and I think that all of Donald Trump's tariffs are built

(1:24:57) around this concept of autarchy so even if he does tariff some things and I like would agree with why he's tariffing a

(1:25:03) thing um I I I I wouldn't agree with any of the tariffs because I would say well the the place that these tariffs are

(1:25:09) coming from is not just it's not like a theory that that I would agree with even if he might do some that I think oh this probably could be beneficial though in

(1:25:15) the long run or whatever okay yeah so I again I think I understand that and that's rational that's rational to me

(1:25:22) the reasoning behind it makes sense whether I agree with it or disagree with it it totally makes sense but then with

(1:25:28) the idea though of the two pillars that you're using here to call him a fascist the tariffs and protectionism that

(1:25:34) you're pointing to then doesn't seem like that would stand as a uh as one of those pillars because it doesn't seem

(1:25:40) like he's doing it from a position of uh of some kind of authoritarianism or even a consolidation of power but just maybe

(1:25:47) perhaps from your view because he's a bumbling idiot and doesn't understand economics right well no the the authoritarian stuff is going to come

(1:25:53) from the central ization of power into the presidency the these would be on the like I said these would be on the um the

(1:25:59) Nationalist side like there are going to be some policies that you take that might be nationalist or Ultra Nationalist and then they're going to be

(1:26:04) some things you might take that would be authoritarian but not necessarily like National let me make sure I got it right the two pillars again the first pillar

(1:26:11) is authoritarian authoritarianism and the other one is hyper is like hyper nationalism so like here's an example

(1:26:16) you might argue that um you know you're kind of familiar with daa right yeah I think you could argue that DACA is a

(1:26:22) type of authoritarianism right where the executive Donald Trump is using with wide discretion um some immigration

(1:26:28) measures that are given to the president uh I think it's called TPS maybe tempor Protective Service in order to basically

(1:26:34) legalize a form of immigration that he couldn't legalize from the Congress we could say that that might be a kind of authoritarianism you're grabbing more

(1:26:40) power for the executive branch but is that a form of nationalism um to be using the authoritarianism to get more

(1:26:47) like immigrants protected in the country probably not so that would be like a form of authoritarianism it's not really a form of like nationalism or hyperism

(1:26:53) right well wouldn't that wouldn't the form of nationalism just be uh based around uh

(1:27:01) kind of the idea that the person is doing something which puts the nation above all other nations right something

(1:27:07) something akin to this I mean you could say that but I feel like at that point we're broadening the definition so much

(1:27:13) that you could make anything into anything right yeah okay so I think that's fair so maybe usually imply some

(1:27:18) form of like native protection native being non-immigrant and usually some shared ethnic character not necessarily

(1:27:24) racial but some sh ethnic character yeah yeah like uh like uh cultural nationalism the idea that we have one

(1:27:30) language and you know some type of cultural uh cohesion this kind of thing doesn't necessarily have to include race

(1:27:37) but there has to be some kind of criteria which is shared amongst the group sure yeah yeah yeah okay yeah I

(1:27:42) think that that's fine um but I mean Democrats have also done this I mean um

(1:27:48) and they they do it all the time uh when it comes to uh you know immigration acts and things like this

(1:27:54) uh where you definitely want to they they definitely seem to still want to select from countries which have uh you

(1:28:01) know a greater base of educated immigrants if they can right so I I'm not I'm not even sure if that would meet

(1:28:07) this criteria for the second leg necessarily so I'm not opposed to the concept of nationalism um or being like

(1:28:15) patriotic or doing things that are in the benefit of your nation I think all of those things are fine it's this

(1:28:21) concept of extreme hyperism M this concept of it's not just enough for us

(1:28:27) to be good or the best but we might even start doing that to the large detriment or expense of other people because we

(1:28:33) are like better than those people and we don't even need those people and this it's this like Island concept basically

(1:28:39) that the autarchy thing is what I'm hearkening back to a lot um and I don't I feel like I mean even Republicans

(1:28:44) before Trump didn't really uh Venture off into that direction much no not not really I mean uh when

(1:28:52) you're talking when you're talking about ultral ISM I think I have the same kind of general idea uh that you're putting

(1:28:58) America first you're talking about things like American exceptionalism you're talking about how you're going to

(1:29:03) put uh you know your your people before uh any other peoples uh you know on planet Earth um I I'm not sure though

(1:29:12) how that's bad exactly but or or even necessarily fascist like um so I mean

(1:29:18) Japan does this right they they're going to they tailor all policies except they do have a racial element right uh but

(1:29:24) they tailor all policies to the interest of the Japanese over all of the groups

(1:29:30) uh I would say that Ultra nationalist but there's definitely it definitely doesn't seem like it's a fascist Nation to me or that they even have fascist

(1:29:36) leaders definitionally weren't they fascist like in World War II they're not now anymore right probably not well they were imperialists wasn't an imperialist

(1:29:43) fascist country though like no no they weren't really again so this is this is where we get into the kind of semantics

(1:29:50) that I'm trying to avoid so it doesn't get okay I'll ditch fascist then CU maybe but I like they belied like in the

(1:29:56) racial superiority of the Japanese ethnic group over every other like Asian population like in the in the when they

(1:30:02) were doing like the soo uh Japanese war and everything right like that was yeah for sure yeah for sure s okay that's

(1:30:08) what I mean want to say so maybe not fascist in the World War II definition of such but okay yeah um yeah but I mean

(1:30:14) yeah Mo most definitely most def I don't think they are now though but they still have those policies in plays yeah they

(1:30:20) they might um I'm only saying they might not because I disagree but I don't know but they might but even if they do I don't I don't care well they basically

(1:30:25) just don't take in immigrants so the the the Japanese like the Japanese um idea

(1:30:31) is to keep Japan Japanese yeah um I don't like um but I don't like Japanese

(1:30:36) stuff like I'm not like a I'm not a Japanese person I'm an American person and I have a different set of values for

(1:30:41) my country no I I agree I agree with that I'm just the I I guess the only reason I'm drawing the parallel is

(1:30:46) because I don't I don't think that even if they're Ultra nationalist by the sense that you're talking about here

(1:30:52) with these two legs of fascism that we would call them fascists I think it would be very difficult to do um that's

(1:30:59) probably true but um remember back to the beginning of the conversation when I say fascist and I Define this as like

(1:31:05) Ultra Nationalist and authoritarian I'm saying with respect to where like American Democratic liberal capitalist

(1:31:12) values are at so like there might be things that Japan does that are like arguably um our good friend State Israel

(1:31:19) right has like immigration policies that work for Israel and I I would say could be Justified for Israel but if we do the

(1:31:25) same thing in the US I'd say hold on this is uh not good that we shouldn't be doing these types of uh policies I can

(1:31:30) understand why this country might do it for different reasons maybe Japan has good reasons I would say probably Israel has like decent reasons but I don't know if the us would have like the same type

(1:31:37) of um justification so so then it really does come down to other if you had other

(1:31:42) nations who had the exact same policies they're not fascist policies but if our nation introduced those policies they

(1:31:48) would be fascist policies because they're against what you consider the spirit of americanism to be yeah like so

(1:31:55) it's not really a defined concept then or or a hard concept it's just basically

(1:32:00) like not what you consider not- American idealism or not in the spirit of American idealism is is is fascism well

(1:32:07) I mean like the thing is is I feel like every kind of political concept is rooted in in um in the history of the

(1:32:14) country right like if I were to go to if I were to be an American chrisan and I were to go to you know the strictest

(1:32:20) places in Afghanistan uh which is all of now and I would say wow women wearing

(1:32:26) burkas this is disgusting women shouldn't be forced to cover up like this like that's gross and then that very same Christian could go to um I

(1:32:33) don't know if in New York it's legal to walk around topless in New York she might say this is disgusting like I have children here why aren't

(1:32:39) these women covering up right is she like a hypocrite because she wants like women to look one way in one country and

(1:32:45) and in another country she thinks they've gone too far no that but that would be the that would be the idea of uh cultural pluralism or ethical

(1:32:53) pluralism I think I think that everybody engages in that so I'm I'm just I'm just kind of willing to bite the bullet on on

(1:32:59) cultural pluralism or ethical pluralism wait wait can you you say that what does that mean I

(1:33:04) don't know what you mean yeah I'll give you I'll give you an idea of this so uh in Christianity we follow the ten commandments right you should yeah yeah

(1:33:12) we should okay so one of the Ten Commandments is honor thy mother and father you agree okay so one of the ways

(1:33:18) that you would honor them if you were in Japan would be to take your shoes off when you went in the door but not in the

(1:33:23) United States so is it dishonorable for uh you to not take your

(1:33:29) shoes off because other Christians take their shoes off the answer is no so the idea here is it's it's ethical pluralism

(1:33:35) the idea is that the culture is going to inform some of the idea and what we're trying to do is get to the principle uh

(1:33:43) rather than the legalism of the idea does that make sense yeah I would probably tr% agree with that that's why

(1:33:49) and I'm sure you figure this out in debating people um debating people and hearing their like con or their theories

(1:33:55) or their or their values or whatever it doesn't actually mean anything until they give you an example because it's

(1:34:01) once you get examples you real okay this when you say that you think that uh that family should be free to make what they think are the right decisions to one

(1:34:08) group of people that might mean I should be able to deny my child to get blood transfusions because I think that this is um an evil and for another group of

(1:34:15) people it might be I want my seven-year-old to have you know hormone replacement therapy because I think they're trans right so both these people

(1:34:20) could have the same theoretically a similar sounding set of principles but until you hear the examples you really

(1:34:25) have no idea what they're talking about so yeah well and and the idea is to to adhere to the principles so the same in

(1:34:31) Christianity or almost all ethics even utilitarians I think would agree okay we have a principle but there's more than

(1:34:37) one way to get to the at the idea of the principle and so uh there's more than

(1:34:42) one way to walk down the path essentially for this kind of ethical view because human human beings are infinitely complex and uh there's many

(1:34:50) different ways to honor thy mother and father uh my neighbor's going to do it a different way than I do it it doesn't mean that they're wrong uh so that moves

(1:34:57) into like the pl pluralistic aspect of you know cultural pluralism or this type of thing uh Christianity's always uh you

(1:35:05) know embraced this I'm sure when you were in Catholic school you know something similar to this was explained

(1:35:10) um and but but again when we're talking about this if I am to say what a Christian was like let's say we said

(1:35:17) it's a somebody who says Jesus Christ is our Lord and savior right something really broad like this uh that's still

(1:35:23) that's pretty definitive criteria for what we mean when we're saying Christian and so we know what to rule out of that

(1:35:29) that's like a whole lot of people we get to rule out immediately I think that kind of where your analogy fails here is

(1:35:36) yeah I I think that if they go and they see a burka and say that's disgusting but then oh hey you have to cover your boobs up they're still adhering to the

(1:35:43) same principle uh and so in in this kind of idea of fascism I think they're still

(1:35:48) adhering to the same principle that you find disgusting it's just that you kind of just say well it's just kind of kind

(1:35:53) of basically based around the cultural aspect the cultural pluralism of the adherence to the principle Americans

(1:36:00) find it disgusting so I don't like it but for another culture fascism might be okay right yeah I I think I largely

(1:36:07) would agree with that yeah but I think that like U like I think you could apply this down the road to anything like for instance if you were to ask me like are

(1:36:13) sweat shops okay I would have to ask in what context in the United States I would think that sweat shops would be

(1:36:19) disgusting but in like a community where every single family was engaged in assistance farming and a

(1:36:24) flood meant that like half the population was going to starve and die I might say okay well Sops is a huge upgrade to these people's standard of

(1:36:31) living actually way better um so it's so yeah I think that I don't know if I would be like fascism or like modes of

(1:36:37) government as these like defined fundamental like axiomatic things I I

(1:36:43) think that you get like a whole bunch of statements and values from them but then you have to plug in a whole bunch of other Concepts that become that are more

(1:36:49) relative basically right so like a liberal might say um like like a capital liberal might say like oh like freedom

(1:36:55) of the press is really important and then somebody else might say like oh yeah we have great freedom of the press

(1:37:01) here um you can say things to your family members and the government won't even come and murder you for it and it's like okay wait are do you have like

(1:37:07) newspapers or anything like that like no no no all the media State R but I'm saying like you're never going to be executed for saying something to your neighbor and I'm like okay well so you

(1:37:14) might have like the same value system there but then you have to plug in I think like what ultimately end up being I mean I would argue obviously as a

(1:37:20) atheist hedonistic atheist whatever I would argue that um that all of these things are relative to the cultures that they exist in yeah well I understand uh

(1:37:28) the cultural relativism aspect again that's rational and it's reasonable to me but when if you say like democracy

(1:37:35) right when you when you tell people uh okay this this country is a democracy you're clearly talking about a very

(1:37:42) Crystal Clear criteria right there's not that much movement which is allowed in there it's like that means that that the

(1:37:49) people are participating in the form of their of whatever type of government or law that they want the people are

(1:37:54) choosing that by some methodology usually voting I think that almost everybody would largely agree to this

(1:38:02) and so I and I think you would agree to it too and so if I said this isn't a democracy you know exactly what I'm

(1:38:07) saying what I'm talking about instantly uh you know that I'm talking about people not having any ability to

(1:38:12) participate in their form of government essentially um fascism I feel like I

(1:38:18) feel like that's kind of we're not we're not there we're not there with this right that this is kind of a different thing you're talking about so I feel

(1:38:24) like with that democracy thing I actually would super disagree with that I think that when we say democracy I don't know if there's an agreement on

(1:38:30) what that means or what that is um I would look to like like reading through a lot now The Federalist Papers I can

(1:38:36) see that there were so many arguments made for different parts of the government or how they should function or what's too much or what's not enough

(1:38:42) or what's an appropriate check and balance or should the people be voting or should electors be voting for president or hang on real quick real

(1:38:48) quick Destiny what the are you doing just so I know I don't know what you're doing people are ask like what is

(1:38:54) he doing I don't know I'll I have a studio that I shoot on my podcast in um but for the election day I'm going to have like a I've got a second room here

(1:39:00) and I'm creating like a secondary studio room here for the election day so I'm just setting up like you're doing live

(1:39:05) coverage uh yeah oh awesome okay I'm sorry I didn't mean to derail you dude go ahead you're talking about democracy

(1:39:11) yeah I think that um I think that what a democracy is and what it's for is actually I think that's really I think

(1:39:16) that's actually a really complicated question um like for instance in a democracy let's say that you have 90% of

(1:39:22) ethnicity a and 10% of ethnicity B should ethnicity a be able to vote for um should they be able to vote to

(1:39:28) enslave ethnicity B right some people would say that that's democracy right but then I mean obviously you've got

(1:39:34) that I don't even know if Ben Franklin said it but there's that quote of like two lambs and a wolf or two wolves a lamb or whatever some people

(1:39:39) say fting over what for dinner yeah some people say well no you need to protect the rights of minorities that's actually

(1:39:45) more democratic but is it I mean is that really more democratic that in a way that's a bit of a tyan tyranny of the

(1:39:50) minority so some people might say that like well minorities having an outsized like influence on the government by getting special protections is not fair

(1:39:57) but then those same people who maybe I would they're probably conservatives would say things like the Electoral College or the Senate composition that

(1:40:03) is fair that states should have an outsized uh influence not just population but States so I think that

(1:40:08) like I I would disagree heavily that the idea that like what is democracy that that's like a super crystallized concept

(1:40:14) I think they're still fighting to this day over what a democracy should be or what it looks like I don't know if everybody I think if you said I think if

(1:40:20) you said a republic I would agree with you if you said what is a republic I think that that would be harder for the

(1:40:25) I think that that would kind of be a better descriptor for all of those things like it I in in a republic uh

(1:40:31) where people have the right to vote are we going to protect minority rights the rights of women are we going to protect this are we going to protect that uh we

(1:40:38) have constitutional constrainment or what sort of Republic do you want but I think democracy itself is just basically

(1:40:43) people voting for a thing that they want I mean I I I I I don't I don't really know what else it would be other than I

(1:40:49) mean like let's say well let's say that we do vote let's say that on the let's say there was a presidential let's say there was a referendum in the next

(1:40:54) election on not only are you voting for the presential candidate we're voting to enslave the other half of the population

(1:41:00) so whoever the popular vote gets to take the other half of slaves like would you say that's Democratic and then yes yeah

(1:41:06) so that would be well I I think that that because a democracy can use democracy to vote democracy out doesn't

(1:41:13) make it less of a democracy that's still like that's that would still be the Democratic process right yeah but would

(1:41:19) it would what exists afterwards would that still be Democratic no I don't think that would be so like I said I think you can use democracy so you could

(1:41:26) you could go to the people and you could say uh how about you vote away your right to vote right and they all go okay

(1:41:32) sure and they do that well now they have no more right to vote right but they use their right to vote to do it um yeah I

(1:41:40) mean that would still be a democracy I wouldn't I wouldn't see how that wouldn't be a democracy sure I guess I I

(1:41:45) feel like like what if you did have a right to revote on that every four years and you were just a slave for the four years while you were like while you were

(1:41:52) waiting for the next election

(1:41:58) theocracy very it's it's I feel like it's a very abstract concept like I think at it at

(1:42:04) its root democracy is really just saying that like the people and that's like a very broad term even that right are

(1:42:11) black people people how early you go in the US do women count as people that Vote or what about like like uh you know

(1:42:16) do non-citizens count as people um democracy in the very broadest sense is like citizens having their will

(1:42:21) represented in the country through some form of ballot like yeah I agree it's just it's the idea that citizens have

(1:42:27) their will represented and can somehow participate so I I I think that like the

(1:42:32) broadest most charitable kind of definition I can give would be that as well but I still think that that's still

(1:42:37) a very particular criteria that we can apply to things um you know when we're talking here about fascism that doesn't

(1:42:44) seem that doesn't seem so clear to me in this it it just seems kind of like uh if it's just an abstract concept then you

(1:42:52) know any anything that anybody does which could meet these potential two legs I could just kind of call them a

(1:42:57) fascist and I don't think that that's getting at the Spirit of what you're saying I mean you I mean you can I mean at the end of the day a label is just a

(1:43:03) label ideally it's like a it's a jumping point for further conversation but I mean like if if you want to say that

(1:43:09) then theoretically you could get more reductive so like theoretically there's a world where um where Steven never

(1:43:15) calls somebody a fascist but instead I just say well these people are actually um they're Ultra nationalist hyper

(1:43:20) authoritarians and then you come in you call me and you're like like hey I want to talk to you about what alra nationalist means and we could have this

(1:43:26) exact same conversation where you're like okay well alra nationalist exists in this like culturally relative vacuum and you shouldn't be saying alter

(1:43:32) nationalist you should have said say x y or Z or whatever and then right it could get like reductive from there right yeah

(1:43:37) well and with that again I'll I'll I'll I'll kind of uh just grant this as being true as well because I think it is uh

(1:43:44) the thing is though is um in that case I think if you were to run around and call people that you politically disagreed

(1:43:51) with a bunch of hyper authoritarian Ultra nationalist um that people honestly

(1:43:56) wouldn't care that much they'd be like okay well that's you know somewhat nebulous meaning this and that but if

(1:44:02) you say fascist that brings up all the loaded baggage which comes with the word fascist and so that I guess that's

(1:44:07) ultimately what I'm getting at is that uh it seems to me like you want to and I do this too we all do this right so to

(1:44:14) be totally fair but it seems like you're you're pummeling that label specifically because of the loaded baggage that it

(1:44:22) has associated with it especially with Nazis right uh and that and that that's the purpose of it rather than

(1:44:29) necessarily due to authoritarianism or trade agreements or tariffs or any of those types of things yeah and I think I

(1:44:34) said that earli in the conversation which is I guess it's technically a little at ends what I said where I'm like people should divorce the

(1:44:39) normativity from their like economic labels or whatever rhetoric's rhetoric right yeah but the yeah I mean like when

(1:44:46) when I'm saying somebody's fascist I I am trying to evoke same with if I call somebody a tanky or a socialist or I am

(1:44:52) trying to evoke some negative um like normative baggage there that is the goal because I don't think that like Hy like

(1:44:58) we shouldn't be okay I mean I would argue that we shouldn't be okay being hyper nationalist authoritarians like we've seen what that looks like in the

(1:45:03) past and I'm trying to evoke all of that feeling when I say that yeah but I mean okay well so I mean uh Socrates said

(1:45:10) himself um that rhetoric is anything which convinces external to logic so

(1:45:16) whatever whatever it is that is convincing for your worldview that you know kind of sways people over to it uh

(1:45:22) abs logic you can kind of type up to rhetoric I think I think that's what he meant by that um so I mean I at least I

(1:45:29) can kind of understand now a bit more the rationale if if you're kind of uh

(1:45:35) with the admittance that hey yeah you're right it is somewhat nebulous and it could be okay these policies in other nations other than this but this doesn't

(1:45:42) really conform to americanism and I'm using the label because it really puts a negative light on Trump I mean is that a

(1:45:49) fair said there that is much less of a bite right much the same that if feel like expanding uh income retribution to

(1:45:56) such a level that it's hard to achieve economic Prosperity as an individual in the United States uh is not good it's

(1:46:01) easier to just call somebody a communist or socialist right um yeah there's a reason yeah well and to bring the loaded rhetoric with it right like a Yami right

(1:46:08) that that's that's very helpful I agree um but it it does it does contend it's a

(1:46:13) bit contentious with the idea though of like you said political normativity so it it doesn't seem like the purpose of

(1:46:20) it exactly is to necessarily fight against the idea of fascism but more it's the idea to just kind of go after

(1:46:28) Trump because you don't like Trump right yeah I guess to bring to bring it back um to two points I made so one point I

(1:46:33) said earlier that um there's tension between now is I said earlier when people discuss like these particular

(1:46:40) perspectives they should be um like it should be dispassionate and unor loaded

(1:46:45) right an authoritarian is authoritarian a democracy democracy it's not necessarily good or bad it just depends right um on other values uh when I'm in

(1:46:52) like debating for um when I'm debating something over somebody being better or worse and then I think that you start to

(1:46:58) bake in more normativity when you're making statements like if I'm arguing against somebody and I'm bringing up the point this guy wants to do this like

(1:47:06) even if that was a purely logical statement right if I were to say comma wants to increase taxes on the top 1% to

(1:47:13) 99% right in that statement even if there's not it's not there explicitly

(1:47:18) there's normativity baked into it I'm arguing against her and I just wrote up a policy it's probably bad right like if

(1:47:23) I was arguing with somebody and they were like you know tell me okay talk to me you don't like Trump like tell me about Trump and I'm like Donald Trump um

(1:47:30) Donald Trump had a rich father your assumption like you would hear that as me saying Donald Trump having a rich father is bad and then if you were to

(1:47:36) say well wait what's wrong with that and I go oh nothing I'm just like stating a fact about Trump you like what the what do you mean you're stating a fact

(1:47:42) about Trump because we don't parse the the language like a machine right we're in the context of the conversation so

(1:47:47) then so so going back to so when I say analyze things like non-n normatively I'm talking about for like jerk off like

(1:47:53) policy discussion basically but now to bring this back to the other point this kind of intention with with Vos when I

(1:47:58) said why are you calling Scalia or bush a fascist the issue that I had there is that I didn't care so much that he was

(1:48:05) calling them a fascist what I cared about is that if we were to have a discussion on why he's calling them a

(1:48:10) fascist he wouldn't be able to back that up he wouldn't be able to justify that that was my big issue like you can't

(1:48:16) just be that he's a but aren't you aren't you at the same aren't you at the same mercy of that like when you say

(1:48:21) Trump's a fascist you also have to back that up and if it's just kind of this this um well there's these two these two

(1:48:28) pillars which I think all all fascists have in common I think even fat you know like third positionist would agree that

(1:48:34) those two pillars could exist but then if you say you know from a from a cultural relative or cultural pluralist

(1:48:40) position I can see why other countries do that and I don't even actually have a problem with it just here you would kind

(1:48:45) of be at the same Mercy Vos was at wouldn't you I don't think so because I think that my the conversation that

(1:48:51) you're talking about right now and just reiterating this for you and the audience because it sounds like I'm attacking but I'm not the the discussion

(1:48:57) we would have would be a one of semantics where we'd be saying like what do we mean when we say fascist but the conversation that I would be debating

(1:49:02) vosch on would be one of substance where vosch would say well no what Scalia is doing is ahistorical it's like way too

(1:49:09) far away from what America should be like we would have a debate on the substance of what does it mean to have American values and what does it mean to

(1:49:14) rule in ways that are congruent with American tradition and I think that's what the debate would be not just over whether or not I agree with his

(1:49:19) particular definition of fascism right like if I had debate like if we were debating and we you guys have to agree

(1:49:26) what well wouldn't you guys have to agree on what that meant to even have that substantive debate um we could but

(1:49:33) but if if if Vos would have just say um it would really depend on the conversation but like this would be the

(1:49:39) same with you and me if V were to say well when I say fascist I just mean he's Conservative then I would say oh well I think that's kind of that's a dumb way

(1:49:44) to define fascist but okay I probably agree with you but that's just a dumb way to define it then we would have a semantics debate but I think on with Vos we would disag substance I think mhm

(1:49:52) rather than the semantics okay I I think I think I understand that as well okay well I think I think we got a lot of

(1:49:58) that cleared up then a couple of questions I have for you since uh since we're in the room the first one is what

(1:50:03) did you think of the Jubilee thing um I it was I mean it's what I'm used to at this point it's kind of wild

(1:50:10) kind of wacky it was bizarre wasn't it am I wrong or was it bizarre it was

(1:50:15) strange I mean it's I feel like at this point I'm kind of used to Crazy wacky people but it was pretty yeah like the

(1:50:21) weird the two things I didn't like where I mean I mean I can say I don't like the personal taex but it's just like it's kind of weird or whatever but the thing

(1:50:27) that I didn't like the most was somebody would sit down and i' actually talked about this on stream before it's like I'm not going to let people just Gish

(1:50:33) gallop and then get voted off and not respond so I was trying to cut people off a little bit more I think even in our conversation I was trying to be a bit more like cutting you off or be

(1:50:39) aggressive because I didn't want you to say something get voted off and I can't respond but the thing was is that some people what they do is they would sit

(1:50:44) down and they would they do they would do like this whole rant at me and then they would just get up before even being voted off and I'm like wait

(1:50:50) what yeah you well okay okay so so the the next day after this was done I was

(1:50:56) on stream because people were asking me about it uhhuh and just so you know I don't know if you know this or not and I

(1:51:02) want to know if you think that this is cheating because this bothers me when uh progressives do this right but if if

(1:51:08) people had an entire group put together of people who knew that they were going to debate you and they all went in a

(1:51:14) group and they all assessed all of your talking points in order to collaborate for who's going to go wi who's going to

(1:51:19) say what who's going to is that cheating to you do you consider that cheating so I'm going to be um I'm going to be very

(1:51:27) like I'm going to be a huge outlier here and I would say that in almost all circumstances I would say probably yeah maybe it's not in the spirit of it I

(1:51:33) would say that for me it's not in the spirit right yeah it's not in the spirit I would say for me personally um I I I

(1:51:39) actually I do I want people to come with their strongest whatever so if you think that like stacking the deck Against Me

(1:51:44) by having better people come up to debate points I'm actually okay with that but I would say that in most cases

(1:51:50) that's probably cheating yeah that's why I got in trouble well that's not what the but that's not what the idea is the

(1:51:55) idea is to choreograph when when this arguments

(1:52:00) made then that's when you move away and that's when the next one comes up and hits you with this or this or this

(1:52:07) that's I think beyond what you're talking about which isn't just here's Destiny's arguments make sure you have

(1:52:12) good arguments when you show up that's fine right neither one of us would disagree that's fine M but isn't it

(1:52:17) isn't the other I mean how's it in the spirit of it man it just seems like it's such slime ball Behavior to me yeah I

(1:52:23) mean I would argue that like like if you came and you knew cuz I I leaked the quest the prompts beforehand which the producer got mad at me for doing but my

(1:52:29) my goal was that like well listen if people have got arguments bring them why not but they told us the prompts beforehand The Producers when

(1:52:36) they they gave us a list of of what it was that your positions were going to be wait or what your prompts were going to

(1:52:43) be wait when I think well so I I wasn't even

(1:52:48) supposed to be there right so I was out in Santa Barbara I was shooting a whatever episode uhhuh and I got a call

(1:52:54) hey if you're in the area you want to come over and do this uh and I said yeah and they didn't they didn't tell us who

(1:53:01) it was um but it was very obvious it was very it was clearly obvious it was probably going to be you uh but they did

(1:53:08) give us a listing of the prompts of what the prompts were going to be or I'm asking like did they give you this like

(1:53:13) the day of or was it released beforehand it was released beforehand to us oh weird okay cuz when I when I went over

(1:53:18) them on stream they emailed me and they were like hey like don't leak this like we're not supposed to tell anybody and I was like oh I didn't realize that

(1:53:24) maybe actually maybe I misinterpreted that maybe they just didn't want it leaked for the public then and not for other participant yeah for us we signed an NDA to not leak those so it's POS

(1:53:32) it's possible that it was just supposed to be for the group which I think that's fine like we need to know what the hell we're debating right but but I think

(1:53:39) it's a a very different thing if there's like a collaboration uh because these groups

(1:53:45) know each other and they're I don't know it's it just seems slimy to me that's all sure I mean like yeah it would have

(1:53:51) been better if they were like unhinged statements but I mean you know what are you going to do yeah well they were just

(1:53:57) shout they just became shouting matches they just became shouting matches I mean I don't even mind shouting matches but I

(1:54:03) feel like just like like the one guy coming up and asking me like what's the penal code for the law or like the one

(1:54:08) guy that came up and he was like can you say that magga wouldn't actually this an Andrew argument but when the guy came up and he was like would you say that how

(1:54:14) can you say that Maga wouldn't exist without disinformation I was like well I mean technically I can't actually know that like we're supposed to you you were there you were sitting there she was

(1:54:20) like I need you to make this prompt more spicy or she was telling me to make

(1:54:30) okay I win that M guy like okay well but you oh yeah that guy you and you were like well yeah this was philosophy 101

(1:54:36) yeah I remember that yeah that was um but you know the truth is is because I

(1:54:41) was sitting behind the speaker I couldn't hear a lot of what those guys were saying like I actually couldn't

(1:54:47) hear it they from your perspective you probably heard them fine but for the audience it was actually very difficult to hear what a lot of those guys said so

(1:54:54) when I rewatched it today I was like oh that's what that guy said I couldn't hear half of it but anyway yeah I just

(1:55:00) wanted to get your take on that uh and see what you thought about uh about the Jubilee thing I I think that it's uh I

(1:55:08) think it's Sneaky to uh to have a to have like a coordination like that personally I like if it was a

(1:55:13) conservative in the chair I would have called foul that's all you know well so

(1:55:19) just conservative cheating again you know nothing nothing new you know it sometimes it doesn't pay to

(1:55:25) be charitable right I mean I'm admitting there's that that was that was that was a bit snaky but uh you know I wasn't

(1:55:32) going to participate in those groups anyway but anyway uh I appreciated the convo was there anything else you want

(1:55:38) to go over while I'm here since you're just around on the computer anyway um I mean not unless you can

(1:55:44) think of anything I'm just building my studio well yeah there's a well there's a couple other things that I wouldn't

(1:55:49) mind dying into so uh we dove into the the idea of what's what's going

(1:55:55) to happen this coming election a little bit but not much Tim pool has had

(1:56:01) multiple people on now who are predicting civil unrest post election uh regardless of the outcome regardless of

(1:56:08) if it's comma or it's uh Trump what do you think there do you think that there's a good possibility of this at

(1:56:14) this point I think that I it's I feel like it's impossible to predict what's going to happen at any given point right now

(1:56:20) in the American election system there's just it's like we're moving in such a new environment and it's like everything is so like you can't we can't look to

(1:56:26) history to try to map on like what we think will happen I have no idea like I've said the same about like people ask me like if Trump becomes

(1:56:32) president what'll happen like I fully believe that there is a world where Donald Trump becomes president and becomes like the most hyper

(1:56:38) authoritarian fascist whatever dictator in the world and does like and destroys American democracy and I think there's a world where Trump becomes president and

(1:56:44) he's just like you I got elected I told you I could like eat and he like resigns or just does nothing for four years except like Jer off in the

(1:56:50) white house like I think both of those could happen um I truly have no idea like I don't think that um the problem

(1:56:58) too is that like the question it it's it's begging a lot of precondition um

(1:57:04) something I've noticed at the med it happens in the media is people will like f the conditions for a feeling to be

(1:57:09) there and then when the feeling is there they'll like cite the feeling like it's novel so somebody will say something like um I'll give an example both sides

(1:57:16) for fairness somebody will say something like cops kill black people all the time it's just like an epidemic in society and then everybody will feel like oh my

(1:57:22) God cops are killing black people all the time and then a conservative will say well hold on it's like not happening anywhere near as much as you guys think

(1:57:28) it is like it's like 10 unarmed black people a year not like 10,000 and then someone like okay well but look people

(1:57:33) have these feelings so there must be something wrong and I was like okay well people have the feelings because you said the thing right and I would make the same dialog tree argument for

(1:57:40) election fraud uh people feel like something happened with the election well of course you've told them that for four years of course they have that

(1:57:45) feeling so when somebody says like is there going to be civil unrest I feel like a lot of it is going to come down to what happens leading up to to the

(1:57:52) election or on the election so if people keep saying that like ballot boxes are going to be rigged or something is going

(1:57:57) to happen and then you know an election turns out a certain way it's like a self-fulfilling prophecy you mean exactly it literally is yeah you're

(1:58:04) manufacturing like pre the event like the feelings that people are going to have and then acting surprised when people have the feelings well I was

(1:58:10) thinking there's a there's a great argument um that I often use and I I'll

(1:58:15) kind of use it here to see see what you think about it the idea of a third party

(1:58:21) ever Bec coming emergent I think is actually silly so when I look at other countries that have uh any type of

(1:58:27) Republic setting or democ democracy setting there's always two main parties just like here and I think that the

(1:58:33) reason that this occurs is because individually uh people don't have very much political power they basically

(1:58:39) don't have any they only have political power if we collectivize as blocks we

(1:58:44) basically have to do this in order to move any agenda forward we want even at the local level we have to do this so I

(1:58:50) think we're essentially stuck with two parties because if one party consolidates enough influence uh to

(1:58:57) actually push push an agenda then people who don't like it will have to then collectivize in equal numbers to oppose

(1:59:03) that agenda so I don't think there's actually any way out of the two-party system so so I think we're stuck with

(1:59:09) polarization until breakdown Destiny I mean maybe yeah I I mean like I think there's a whole bunch of um like

(1:59:16) statistical um artifacts I don't know if you call them that make it as well that we have to be two parties like the spoil

(1:59:22) effect is a big one let's say that I slightly disagree with Trump or I slightly disagree with comma and I make my own party all I'm doing is

(1:59:27) entrenching the power on the other side because now I've split the vote on my side with people that would hopefully agree with me more than the other people

(1:59:33) so that's an issue first pass the post is arguably an issue although every voting system has problems um our

(1:59:39) Congress is arguably an issue because we don't have a parliamentary system like I don't know yeah I I don't necessar but even in those systems even those those

(1:59:46) systems it usually just comes down to one party which has enough influence that if another party wants to to oppose

(1:59:52) it they have to collectivize in significant enough numbers to do so and so you it just kind of always ends up

(1:59:57) being this two-party thing over and over again it kind of makes sense why because you have to have enough of a block to

(2:00:03) oppose something right yeah but I think that one of the nice things about I hate that I'm saying this this Huey

(2:00:09) guy convinced me a little bit one of the nice things about having more than two parties even if we had like a four-party system in the United States I think it

(2:00:16) would be greatly improved because a four-party system would cause each of the two main parties to change a little

(2:00:22) bit to so that they don't lose too much so like let's say for instance let's say you thought K was too far left or there

(2:00:27) are a lot of people right now maybe not you included there a lot of people that might not be happy with Trump but honestly like you might not like Trump

(2:00:33) but even you might even think that Trump the Insurrection was gr all that but  voting for a farle government voting for Comm that's a it's a tall

(2:00:40) order for like a principally conservative person that's a really hard thing to do so but if there was a second

(2:00:46) conservative party to vote for there's two good things that happen one you can still vote conservative but you don't

(2:00:51) have to buy into the crazy conservative guy if you don't like him but also to it might moderate the view of that crazy

(2:00:57) conservative guy a little bit because now you'll lose a ton of people to the other conservative party same thing on the left if there are two left parties

(2:01:02) right if you feel like your person's going too far left well they've got your vote no matter what because you're not  voting conservative not in the United States um but if there's a second

(2:01:09) left party it gives people another option and it forces people to moderate a bit I feel like having four parties would would help a lot but who knows

(2:01:14) maybe we run it could it could but I guess I get the argument that I would make against this is if you take a

(2:01:20) single issue like abortion one side literally thinks you're murdering babies and the other one thinks that they're

(2:01:25) lunatics right it's it's actually pretty simple right one side literally believes you're murdering children the other side thinks you're not right like well it

(2:01:33) break it breaks down to this if one side gathers enough influence to then say

(2:01:38) okay we're going to push the agenda through to murder babies then if that that's the rhetoric from that uh from

(2:01:44) the other side right then NE it seems to me that necessarily everybody who doesn't want to see babies murdered are

(2:01:51) are going to then collectivize in order to oppose this party that believes in

(2:01:57) baby murder right so I I don't I don't see a way around it because they would have to have enough influence to stop

(2:02:03) that agenda which means it would have to equalize right it would have to be at least one to one sure I I think that the

(2:02:09) challenge for people when they think about government is there is no like catch all like this is the best system

(2:02:15) that solves for every problem I think probably the beauty or the niess of the American system is that it seems to have

(2:02:21) been able to incorporate a huge diverse set of viewpoints and somehow we all function as the same

(2:02:26) government um through like a dispersion of power through different states through different bodies of checks and

(2:02:31) balances through the urements of some rights and others like but that's just like part of our ongoing that's part of

(2:02:36) our like it's just part of the the thing right like the problem that you're talking about there there's no I don't think there's like a solution for I

(2:02:42) don't think there is no yeah yeah I don't think there is and so when I talk to the um you know the third party

(2:02:49) voters I think at the local level it can be done Done Right very local level by

(2:02:54) the way I'm not even talking at the state level because that seems to be influenced by federal Politics as well

(2:02:59) but at your at your very local level I think that you could you possibly have a breakdown this way but I don't see how

(2:03:06) it can be done at the national level because a single issue that a party proposes that has enough support would

(2:03:12) have to have enough support on the other side in order to smack it down so it's going to collectivize the power in the

(2:03:17) hands of a couple of blocks I just I just really don't see a way around it yeah I think one of the Bigg issues uh something I used to talk about a lot um

(2:03:24) one of the biggest issues is we became I guess you could argue there a downside of globalism or maybe a downside of actually the internet um is we became

(2:03:30) like a really big International or national Community to where um where you

(2:03:36) can exert you know that locally you can exert a high degree of influence right

(2:03:41) like you have a much better chance of reaching an agreement with your wife than you do with your mayor than you do with your Governor than you do with the

(2:03:46) President right um and but the problem is is that the only thing that people are interested in right now

(2:03:52) unfortunately are the things that people have the least control over right somebody most people in the United States have a stronger opinion about AOC

(2:04:00) than they do about their local mayor so like what kind of world is that like how do we how do you get people to feel like

(2:04:06) they're empowered to advocate for Change and to have like control over their local politics when they don't know anything about their local politics and

(2:04:12) they're just obsessed with the the national level that probably doesn't even really affect them as much as they think it does um but that's like a

(2:04:18) that's a whole like cultural internet related issue and I don't even know how you begin to address um that because

(2:04:23) nobody wants to see I don't even know if it can be addressed right some of this some of this I think is just a burning

(2:04:29) fire that has to burn itself out there's nothing anybody can do about it at this point there just really isn't much that can be done so um the well like for

(2:04:38) instance let me give you an example you you have seen that there are tons and tons of women who say that they're going

(2:04:44) to vote for kamla Harris because she's a woman right I mean um and that's their right to do it right they can vote for

(2:04:50) her because she's a woman but they get really upset if people say well then I'm not going to vote for her because she's

(2:04:55) a woman even though this is essentially the same argument both ways right I'm gonna do this based on this criteria

(2:05:02) well then I'm not going to do it based on this criteria but if that's all it takes to vote is just uh you know you're

(2:05:09) you just are emotionally invested based on uh even the gender of the person then

(2:05:14) I'm not so sure that this is a a particularly solvable issue in that light well I mean yeah I mean you have

(2:05:20) to I mean again sometimes the the solution um that we're looking for isn't necessarily like a a a

(2:05:28) quote unquote solution what we're really just looking for is um something that can hold the tension right which I guess

(2:05:35) in in an oddly poetic way is kind of like all of life right like you're a composition of cells that are fighting

(2:05:41) to maintain their cellular structure inside of organel inside of organs inside of a body that's fighting to maintain homeostasis against a chaotic

(2:05:48) outside world and I mean arguably like governments and everything are the same right right you're just how do you control the tension in a way that allows

(2:05:54) you to move forward with as many different people as possible without everybody breaking apart and killing themselves but I mean at the end of the day that's all you can do is just

(2:05:59) finding the way to Best contain that right when there's too much tension you get authoritarians you get whatever who

(2:06:05) have to like excise some of it when there's too little tension because you've I guess you've just killed everybody then I mean like usually these

(2:06:11) states fail for other reasons too but I I mean yeah that's all I mean at the end of the day yeah there's nothing that sols for every problem it's just things

(2:06:16) that then contain the tension and make people happy enough yeah yeah I mean there's a lot of

(2:06:22) Truth in that I though I think we come at it from uh very different angles and then I guess last saying and then I'll get out of your hair and let you get

(2:06:28) back to building your studio um are you willing to uh put a so so I'm willing to

(2:06:35) to put a bet against you for a thousand bucks that Trump loses if you're willing to put up a thousand bucks that he

(2:06:41) wins I well my voting that would make sense because I voted in favor of KLA right now I would right well right right

(2:06:47) but this this is the way we can predict what you think who you think's going to win who you think going to lose I mean I

(2:06:53) think I think KLA is going to win I think it's slightly in her favor but I think she's going to win so wouldn't I want to bet for

(2:06:58) kamla yeah well so I mean I I think I think Harris is going to win too um okay

(2:07:04) well yeah that's that that's uh that's annoying to me to uh to have to say but I think I think that there's a a better

(2:07:11) better than average chance that she's going to I mean if you if you want then so like I could give you

(2:07:17) um I I can't do it my I could give you two to one and I could say fine I'll put $1,000 on Trump and if I win you pay me

(2:07:23) 2,000 and if you win I'll give you 1,000 I think double double or nothing

(2:07:29) well I mean like it's you just we would have if we both think that KLA is going to win then the only way that I would vote Trump is if you give me odds right

(2:07:36) yeah I'll give you two to one sure although or you could match that better maybe 1.5 to one I don't know what the uh current markets are but yeah we'll

(2:07:44) just do it we'll just do a two to one so if if uh Trump loses you're paying out two grand and if Trump wins I'm paying

(2:07:50) out one is correct Trump loses if Trump loses I pay I'm paying out two you're

(2:07:56) paying out one yeah it would be that yeah sure if you want we can well hold on the okay the only thing we would have

(2:08:02) to qualify unfortunately is what does it mean to win or

(2:08:07) lose oh yeah I didn't I didn't think about that oh because like

(2:08:15) what if it is the case that they what if somebody wins and cuz like let's say somebody wins and they manage to block

(2:08:20) the vote in the house and somebody doesn't become president then then did it count or what if somebody wins but then let's say Trump Ora argues

(2:08:27) with the governors and they change their elector votes how about this if it's an ordinary

(2:08:33) process with no significant okay if it's without significant aberration

(2:08:38) significant aberration sure like so like January 6 wouldn't count as a significant like a delaying of the

(2:08:44) certification of the vote wouldn't count but like a change in elector votes after the certification date or something that's going to count yeah that's going

(2:08:50) to count all right all right we got a two to one sounds good Destiny I'll let you get out of here have a good one okay have fun be careful all right take

(2:09:10) care can you explain the BET why two to one I think those are really good odds for me aren't they right now

(2:09:24) like he should that's why I suggested 1.5 to one because I think that um I'm pretty sure those [Music]

(2:09:31) are oh switch your inputs oh thank God true I think 1.5 to one is probably more

(2:09:36) fair on his end

(2:09:45) but those are awful odds for you wait really

(2:09:53) I don't believe so I don't know if I believe this poly Market stuff I don't know if these if this poly Market

(2:09:59) is real like if this site is going to pay out or

(2:10:06) not you're going to pay 1K if Trump loses no correct but um if Trump wins I

(2:10:13) get 2K and I think the odds I don't think that Trump is a is a is less than a one to two dog or whatever if that

(2:10:20) makes sense I change the mic settings

(2:10:40) back I said they didn't know the topics beforehand for Ben Shapiro you got different treatment I wonder if I got

(2:10:46) different treatment because I leaked it maybe I'm trying to be very charitable here

(2:10:58) did you just headed your bet with Wes I mean if somebody's going to give me the right odds I'm going to bet on anything right like if if somebody gives you the

(2:11:04) if somebody gives you favorable odds you should bet on anything right theoretically [Music]

(2:11:24) is this this compared to my boys wait that's to

(2:11:30) l oh my God holy I just I just  I just saw a no no no no

(2:11:37) wait did I hold on did I just see an audio problem if I have a compressor red

(2:11:42) the same channel hold on does my music get louder when I talk hold on

(2:11:54) okay when I speak right now is the compressor kicking up the volume on

(2:12:00) my all right and I'm coming back here testing one two and when I'm talking does the music get louder and then go

(2:12:08) back no it doesn't okay okay good oh nice okay I didn't know how that compressor train work there for a sec

(2:12:14) okay this is an appropriate volume right okay cool

(2:12:25) you thought it was side chained uh I don't know necessarily what side chained mean but I think my whole compressor is side chained yeah I have every single

(2:12:32) microphone individually and all of that goes to one I have it uh one physical

(2:12:37) output called microphones um and then that one has the compressor running on it because what I found is if I compress

(2:12:43) the mics individually what would happen is is some of them would have a phasing issue or delay because I think that the

(2:12:50) compression unfortunately is a software based even though it's on the interface itself

(2:12:56) which is actually surprising and annoying because these interfaces are so high quality and I can't believe that

(2:13:02) somebody else hasn't thought of that problem I wonder if um I wonder if I did

(2:13:10) if I just don't understand something there huh

(2:13:22) they're eating the dogs they're eating the cats they're eating the babies oh my God Biden what are you

(2:13:33) doing oh I love these messages hold on all right I see a message I see like the the

(2:13:40) start of the message and it is I used to think you were okay is it going to be I used to think you were a super big cuck

(2:13:46) and then I heard you debate and I think you're awesome or is it going to be I used to think you were reasonable and rational but then I saw you do X and I think you're crazy let's go I used to

(2:13:52) think you were a prick after watching the Jubilee you changed my mind nice one man oh look at that good

(2:14:10) job do you think that Trump complaining about fraud in PA is showing that he knows he's underperforming there um it

(2:14:17) would be hard to mind read there could be a billion issues for that um it could

(2:14:22) like yeah it's hard to mind read on that it could literally be that um they know that Pennsylvania is going to be

(2:14:27) probably one of the most important States um so it might be that they're preparing in advance to have people

(2:14:32) contest the vote there so who

(2:14:47) knows are your effect pre or post slider uh I don't use any of the sliders at all

(2:14:52) that I just don't like sliders I don't know maybe that's like a newbie thing for me that I need to learn but I

(2:14:58) I don't like sliders at

(2:15:04) all I have everything at uh all every single slider I've got is a

(2:15:11) zeroed sliders are called faders yeah faders I don't use any of the faders at all everything is set to a zero

(2:15:21) um what did I come here for oh hold on one

(2:15:44) second when will you share the secret me that Dan learned at the end of a yesterday um you can ask us on Election Day I guess cuz we'll know for sure not

(2:15:52) why don't you buy your own Studios you get have cool art painted inside [Music]

(2:15:58) um honest to God the um having like a having a studio in my apartment is so

(2:16:04) nice if it was if I had to like drive somewhere bro I don't know if I'm like becoming like if I'm like too online or

(2:16:12) if I'm a I don't know I I really don't like going out into the real world and

(2:16:18) doing anything because it feels like everything takes forever everything

(2:16:23) takes forever um

(2:16:30) like even driving back from the airport like yesterday or the day before it was

(2:16:35) like construction everywhere it took me like an hour to get back um to to get

(2:16:41) through like every and I just like if I go to the bank I feel like it's 2 hours like oh I need to deposit a check well

(2:16:47) there's going to be three people in line one teller working the counter and the two people in front of you are old people that can't hear and want to do

(2:16:53) literally the most complicated International Financial Market transaction that nobody here has ever

(2:16:58) heard of in your entire life it's like bro like give me a walkth through holy like give me a

(2:17:03) terminal that I can just like remote deposit at yeah I don't know I just I feel like

(2:17:09) every single time I go out into the real world to do something like everything just feels like it's it takes so long

(2:17:14) and it drives me crazy this is why like I order everything off of um I just order everything off Amazon

(2:17:20) now you don't have the scanning checks thing uh there's a limit I think you can only deposit 5K on a on a on a mobile app

(2:17:29) scan okay I'm not making good progress on this chair andure mesh mechanism

(2:17:34) front front did you see Trump on Rogan admitting that Hillary ConEd the election the night yes I said

(2:17:42) it why can't you just hire a human to do all that stuff for you we'll see after the

(2:17:48) um after the election okay one thing that I'm thinking in my mind

(2:18:00) of um never mind I don't want to say

(2:18:05) anything well I'll see I'm considering things okay find the two screws circled in

(2:18:11) red two screws circled in red is that these no these are blue which are the

(2:18:17) screws we need to tighten next

(2:18:28) wait what the there are no screws in red find the two oh no the circling is

(2:18:33) red good one please tighten the two internal

(2:18:39) black screws who do you bank with uh Wells

(2:18:44) Fargo my phone app lets me use Quick deposit and request limit increases oh I can only do 5K for per deposit so do you

(2:18:53) have USAA from your parents 25k Mobile deposit limit no um I think they

(2:19:01) use sacom am I making that up Strategic Air Command mobile deposit or what do

(2:19:07) they use what's the Air Force like Credit Union what's it called does anybody know what I'm thinking

(2:19:14) of sack Federal Credit Union is that a real thing that I just said

(2:19:22) people that still Place orders in person at fast food restaurants trigger the  out of me now I don't mind I just

(2:19:28) wish that [Music] um just know what you want before you go

(2:19:34) up what the am I doing right now how am I supposed to tighten these find the two scw Circle the screws

(2:19:40) we need to tighten next please

(2:19:48) tighten the oh I see it's these okay this what am I tightening this

(2:19:56) on to save installation time the armor screws are already assembled when the chair arrives align the armor screws

(2:20:01) with the screw holes and black rest six

(2:20:08) oh oh back rest not black rest I mean black people can rest there too but

(2:20:37) okay so here like this I think so

(2:20:51) you have to ditch Wells Fargo and switch to Sofi why I have no idea why people

(2:20:56) prefer some banks over others I truly don't know as long as they like have ATMs and like why the do I

(2:21:16) care okay also somebody has to tell me I didn't correct Dan on the I didn't correct animal podcast I don't want to

(2:21:22) lose my my poor uh my poor Valor okay for saying I had a rough time

(2:21:30) sometimes do you can you ever go to the junkyard to find tires I know you can get like the actual like tires I know

(2:21:37) that sometimes you can go to find sometimes rims but I feel like when I I feel like when you go to the junkyard

(2:21:42) like the only time I ever went to the junkyard was to find like panels um for like a car so like for instance let's

(2:21:47) say you get like damage on like a bumper bumpers were so good but I like usually tires and Tires and Batteries and

(2:21:53) stuff all that was always uh looted or like I feel like the

(2:21:59) only time like you I feel like you have to get super super super lucky to get a wheel um to actually like get a to get a

(2:22:04) wheel uh that is still working and not  out of a junkyard

(2:22:12) but like you're you're usually your luckiest finds are like panelings like outside panelings for the cars

(2:22:21) Pick and Pull part yards I fig yeah but yeah yeah but for the pick and pulls it was like like bumpers and and side

(2:22:26) paneling and so when you see a car like driving around um with a bumper with like a different paint

(2:22:37) job bro the most expensive repair that you can do for your car also

(2:22:43) another reason why poor people always drive around with like mismatched Parts if they do have to do that junkyard Pick and Pull

(2:22:48) bro if you get like a bumper repainted even like 20 years ago that would

(2:22:54) cost like $500 what the what the like it really

(2:23:03) why why there's no shot 500 like it was insanely expensive you would never you

(2:23:08) never ever ever ever if you're if you're doing a pick a pull or if you're like swapping out like a you're never getting it re repainted it just isn't it's

(2:23:15) absurdly expensive that

(2:23:26) if you are a real poor you can get a can of spray paint and do three codes yeah  that you can immediately tell when  is spray painted and um

(2:23:32) because it looks it's got a different gloss and shine to it you have to like to do painting on cars properly you have to like know what you're doing one you

(2:23:39) have to make sure the color is matched exactly or it's going to look weird um you have to do like the the different coats or whatever you need like it's not

(2:23:45) just paint it's like paint and wax and like whatever other um to make it like like the same level of shine and

(2:23:51) so that it doesn't scratch as easy and all that

(2:24:02) you don't know about secondhand tire stores I bought from them it's a whole Market I yeah I never heard about

(2:24:08) secondhand tire stores that sounds crazy wait Tire or wheel I can never

(2:24:14) tell when you guys say I know that you can buy Wheels secondhand I need to stop I need to stop um

(2:24:20) everybody uses these words interchangeably I need to remember this I don't know if you're saying Tire or

(2:24:27) wheel oh Tire okay no he does mean Tire or does he mean wheel tire tire just means the rubber it should mean the

(2:24:34) rubber but people will say tires when they mean Wheels as well oh people say rims sometimes they seen when they mean

(2:24:39) Wheels [Applause]

(2:24:51) why is it so

(2:25:00) actually you know what I probably don't I probably just never bought tires

(2:25:06) that as long as the rubber's still

(2:25:16) there that how are your Treads I meant back in the

(2:25:22) day now I do obviously of course you going go racing around your little  car uh tires are probably one

(2:25:29) of the most important if not the most important part of your

(2:25:36) um drivetrain drivetrain is

(2:25:42) um is from the crank back to the bit crank to the tire right crank to the ground I don't know I think

(2:25:53) what do you think of The Sopranos um so far uh it's

(2:25:58) good please buy a new car after the election someday I

(2:26:06) will the problem is just I just I don't think I even drive enough

(2:26:14) now will you use the new Big studio for other things after the election um I don't know

(2:26:20) [Music] okay this this thing is taking me like an hour to build it's a chair

(2:26:27) Jesus probably bring your mom down here and bang [Music]

(2:26:36) her did the H crew stop Ethan from watching the destiny Jubilee video wait really if you don't drive a lot get the

(2:26:42) Lotus I'm like triggered because I feel like I'm going to get the Lotus and I'm going to pull out of like a parking lot and it's going to scrape the underside

(2:26:47) and I'm going to lose my mind immediately

(2:26:59) should buy 99 to 04 Mustang convertible they're the best cars I like cars but I I don't care at all about like old cars

(2:27:06) I have no desire no um like I don't it just that's like not

(2:27:12) an interest to me not I'm not saying they're bad or it's dumb I just I will say though something I'm

(2:27:20) hyped for is the next car I get will have luxury features okay I want a car

(2:27:28) that beeps at me when I'm switching lanes if there's a car next to me okay I'm ready I'm ready for these features

(2:27:35) okay I think I've earned it I want a nice backup camera okay

(2:27:53) oh I see where this is wiggly at it's nice heated seats oh my God I'm

(2:28:00) going to be honest I never never liked heated seats

(2:28:15) [Music] much I feel like

(2:28:21) um a Lotus looks tiny in real life I mean I'm 5'8 I can tiny CS are fine for me

(2:28:29) um I feel like the the thing that sucked the most about okay you ever do like a

(2:28:35) cold water dive and when you're in cold water if you're s if you stay still it's fine but then as soon as you start

(2:28:40) moving like all the cold water it's just like so much worse I feel like in Nebraska when it was really cold when

(2:28:45) you get in your car if you sit down it's okay but as soon as you move your arms through like the atmosphere in the car

(2:28:51) it's like freezing and I just I don't remember the cold part being like my seat where I'm like God my seat is so

(2:28:57) cold it was just more like the entire world around you but I don't know I never had heated seats in in Nebraska so

(2:29:02) maybe I'd feel differently

(2:29:07) okay front so this is the

(2:29:14) back I'm just a real big car guy so I understand oh I don't like big cars I like big dicks though when it's my dick

(2:29:20) I'm just kidding I know what you mean yeah but you can compensate you keep your core warm and your limbs will

(2:29:26) follow yeah okay Batman also that's  okay your limbs are always cold

(2:29:32) that's always the coldest part

(2:29:50) have a relevant get over there and help you since we are paying for his hotel for the next 5 days no a relevant is not slave labor I want a relevant on the

(2:29:57) election stream I don't care we should pay for as

(2:30:08) Hotel have you ever done a cold plunge um I don't know like kind of I don't know if it

(2:30:15) counts not like in the Wilderness but I've done um

(2:30:22) like i' I've done like cold pools before yeah are you willing to reattempt my LED bookshelf plan that it's not

(2:30:29) worth it all that  you made poor Jade fly out on our

(2:30:35) own money I listen I think we should be covering trouble for every person I think that's that's may like a sard but

(2:30:40) Hey listen I'm only 50% okay what do you want me to

(2:30:46) say do you think you came out a bit too partisan in the Alex con considering he comes off from a very nonpartisan angle

(2:30:52) no I I want to come off as very partisan yes I am partisan I don't think that

(2:30:57) both sides are the same I I want I do support holy the Democratic side right now it's not even close

(2:31:03) Okay uh oh Dan is saying fake news that we did Cover Jade

(2:31:13) stuff Ethan's crew bullied him out of watching your Jubilee there Dan called Destiny a pedo Defender when who do I

(2:31:20) defend that's a

(2:31:26) pedophile what's the problem with vo ID laws bro go watch aot I've talked about voter ID laws like 50 trillion

(2:31:41) times probably the vosch thing do I defend vosch or did vosch call me a ped Defender

(2:31:50) probably the Mr girl Arc listen I created and destroyed Mr girl I brought him into this world and then I took him

(2:31:55) out actually he took himself out of it I guess

(2:32:06) but you said you didn't care about the Vos Lolly Stone oh I don't give a about lollycon

(2:32:12) okay what's wrong with the remain in Mexico it seems effective but you seem totally opposed um it's hard to even

(2:32:19) talk about this I I mean I would say that on its face remain in Mexico is like an abhorent like disgusting

(2:32:24) terrible policy but the problem is when people talk about like remain in Mexico and Asylum Seekers they come from the

(2:32:30) perspective that every single Asylum Seeker is Faking It the reality is is like if somebody is genuinely escaping a

(2:32:38) country where they're being like persecuted and their lives are being destroyed and like they have to leave their whole family behind or or or not

(2:32:44) their family I'm sorry like all of their possessions and everything and they're like completely and they come to the United States saying like hey like I

(2:32:50) am seeking Asylum like my life is my country is trying to kill me like it's and you're like okay well why don't you go ahead and hop over

(2:32:55) Mexico and chill there for six months while we figure your out I think that's inhumane but the problem is when people talk about remain in Mexico and

(2:33:00) they talk about these policies what they're really talking about is they just don't want any of these people in or they assume most of them are Faking It

(2:33:07) Right the problem with Asylum seeking is the conversation starts off in two totally different places where most

(2:33:13) conservatives talking about Asylum seeking they just don't want any Asylum Seekers at all here

(2:33:19) [Music]

(2:33:43) as Mexico even okay with being an American waiting room I have no idea Trump Advance talked about removing Birthright citizenship wait really

(2:34:03) funny thing is about the Alex oconor Vo ID thing is that the UK didn't have voter ID requirements till 2023 and Scotland and Welsh elections still don't

(2:34:08) require V oh is that true any worry that current asy will get kicked out we've let in so many ukrainians no I

(2:34:14) mean it's we I like the issue is is truly I wish would have passed that

(2:34:20) border Bill like it would have helped so much we just need to process these  and having that border Bill like would have provided for so

(2:34:26) much more funding and so many more people to um litigate or process I say

(2:34:31) litigate I guess process those claims but the

(2:34:38) um wait is this the

(2:35:00) place the assembled

(2:35:06) chair oh I'm putting it on the wrong thing

(2:35:31) my 4our chair construction stream

(2:35:38) Jesus hello please go up there we

(2:35:44) go it's crazy how conservatives refuse to acknowledge Trump asking Republicans to deny the Border Bill the family should sue him for even mentioning their

(2:35:49) names when he's been so divisive on keeping the Border open yeah crazy I'm surprised you're being a

(2:35:55) little more aggressive on the top of immigration right now there's no logical argument for not letting more immigrants in Legally but the conversation always framed around immigrants being bad and

(2:36:01) how we can limit it I mean like that's it's just a whole economic World of Pain

(2:36:07) to to debate that like people just it's a

(2:36:14) lot it's a lot because and like it sounds good to say

(2:36:20) like intuitively that more immigrants mean less wages for like natives like

(2:36:25) that just sounds good intuitively and you have to go through a whole ass like demand chain to say why that's not the

(2:36:30) case and labor Chains It's just like

(2:36:42) okay okay do you think the German guy is fat there a lot of big

(2:36:47) Germans okay he said here type type

(2:36:53) type am I going to want his computer here he's not going to be able to see

(2:36:59) us if I put him here or I could put it against that

(2:37:04) wall [Music]

(2:37:15) um I think I should put it against that wall cuz then we can make eye contact the

(2:37:21) whole time it's not it's

(2:37:29) okay does he want to be on cam or does he want to be more of a produc oh true would it be on cam no no no this is

(2:37:35) can work we're

(2:37:45) fine I bought a mini fridge

(2:37:51) I don't know where I want it yet

(2:38:07) though someplace over

(2:38:14) here you comment on the Congressional letter sent to Twitch uh no or I mean it's we'll see what happens yeah

(2:38:20) I feel like your studio is going to get  hot and people are going to be pissed um I mean we turn the AC on it's all you

(2:38:26) can do right if it gets too hot we can open a window like the low right now outside of

(2:38:32) 76 is not too bad oh no can you open these windows I think you can oh we can't actually I think we tape them

(2:38:38) because we have the filters

(2:38:44) on which part is taped down

(2:38:50) don't actually know oh no no no they're not okay

(2:39:23) [Applause]

(2:39:35) should get a guy who can run around and get stuff order food Etc if you haven't already um probably to um in a couple days I'll just go to CVS and I'll buy

(2:39:42) like a ton of drinks um yeah sodas and stuff for food I imagine it'll

(2:39:47) probably just be like ordering pizzas you know why have you not uploaded Jubilee Clips on Tik Tok these things go super viral

(2:39:53) there um [Applause]

(2:40:37) [Music]

(2:40:43) I'll do a lot of um I'll have a more cohesive like media

(2:40:48) strategy after the election I have like new ideas for implementing employment um something

(2:40:55) I said I came to the realization a few months ago I think I talked about this on stream a little bit but I've thought about and now I've talked to there's two

(2:41:01) guys that chust for business stuff I've been talking a lot about like how to figure this out

(2:41:08) um and I know I have a better understanding I said this on stream and it sounded like a meme but it's very

(2:41:14) true I think that the um the best employees

(2:41:20) that you can get are people that are uh are people that do for free um one thing that I thought of

(2:41:27) before when I started making more money doing stream stuff um my thought process

(2:41:33) is like oh like I'm making a ton of money this is awesome uh I need to find

(2:41:38) like uh I I need to find ways to pay people cuz paying artists is good and giving money to people is like awesome

(2:41:43) like everybody around me can make um can make money like this is so cool and in a very counter intuitive sense one thing

(2:41:50) that I discovered was when you offer to pay money to people there are a lot of people that come out that aren't very passionate about things but they just

(2:41:56) kind of want like earn money doing it and they're not very good at what they do but when you do like a hey here's like a Creator artist contest or like my

(2:42:03) composition challenges where you're not getting paid you get like some of the most insane high quality work

(2:42:10) ever um and I'm like holy so I think I need like when I'm doing Talent

(2:42:16) scouting um I need like a I've got like ideas in my mind for like trial periods

(2:42:22) or like Community contest first or something to like pick out talent I need to um I need to have this concept in

(2:42:27) mind more so like now because I noticed that for so long I've tried to

(2:42:33) like go through different um like who can make clips for my Tik Tok who can make clips for Instagram who can make

(2:42:38) clips for um you know these short form things right and and I'm trying to think of this and I'm like like it seems like

(2:42:44) it is not working it's never worked I haven't gotten it done but when the Twitter group The Dol band got made

(2:42:50) um all of a sudden now um there's this like this bad Goku guy and I don't even want to say his name because there are

(2:42:56) other people too and I I can't remember all the names but there are some people that are doing like amazing work like

(2:43:01) better than I could have ever asked for from like anybody that I ever would have paid ever for any of these things and I'm like these are the people that I

(2:43:07) should be hiring these guys are doing a phenomenal job so um yeah I just need to uh I need to find

(2:43:15) ways to like talent scout initially I guess like offering no compensation and then like people after I found after I

(2:43:21) find out they like oh hey you can do like a really good job

(2:43:38) yeah but um now especially what I've seen with that Twitter Community can do how much are you supposed to connect this um I'll probably find some

(2:43:45) way uh to incorporate like I need a grander media strategy and honestly and it's very it's I'm I'm starting to

(2:43:51) wonder if the um if the short clip is going to be similar to my YouTube

(2:43:57) feelings like for my YouTube stuff I was incredibly sad because I feel like starting YouTube as late as I did was

(2:44:03) probably one of the most harmful things about like my whole career trajectory um that I had a YouTube with 100,000

(2:44:09) subscribers in like 2011 and I just abandoned it and then it took like five

(2:44:15) or 10 years or something um to actually start a real

(2:44:22) YouTube um and and I I feel like the the short

(2:44:28) form content clipping stuff I think that that's like had a significant impact on public perception I mean in a lot of

(2:44:34) areas like I think it has been like tremendously important and so it's a little bit sad

(2:44:40) that it's taken me so long to get to that area yeah

(2:45:02) am I even doing this right or am I being  [Music]

(2:45:10) oh there's no way this will work like this I need to do this and then this

(2:45:27) as an artist sometimes I'll do one project really well for free because it matches my interest but that doesn't mean projects I would be paid for afterwards would capture my interest the

(2:45:33) same way um maybe I think the issue is that if you get employees you need like a CEO type

(2:45:39) who stays on their ass and make sure  gets done yeah I no I am aware of that yeah this is something I'm I'm

(2:45:44) working at in the background as well how much reach do you have compared to like among the Zoomers I don't know

(2:45:51) actually it's really hard to measure it pan has a really big reach on Twitch but I feel like he's very hard to find

(2:45:57) outside of twitch um so it's it's hard to quantify that

(2:46:26) people say he's huge on Tik Tok but I don't I'm not too sure how true that is I don't know it's very hard to quantify a lot of

(2:46:34) the Tik Tok  okay this is this for real like

(2:46:42) this I should just read the book Tik Tok San watches a lot of his

(2:46:47) yeah yeah it's hard to measure to because other people like upload people's videos and so you can't just look at One account can you track

(2:46:54) broadly speaking people's um like mentions or

(2:46:59) whatever you need to have a clipping Discord yeah I think I already have I already have

(2:47:07) that we already have that okay what are we looking for attach the headrest to the back rest tighten two screws and

(2:47:14) then press the headr cover okay

(2:47:25) you think that Adam guy paid by Russia why would he burn the bridge with sitch what no shot he's just

(2:47:32) he just got bullied too much by a group of people and then he became a it's the same thing that's happening to

(2:47:37) Anna casparian right now

(2:47:55) do you pay your clippers it incentivizes them um it would actually be so

(2:48:00) interesting to talk to a bunch of other business people um I don't um depending on who you are I

(2:48:10) don't know if that's true I used to think that like my understanding before is that like rev splits would are like

(2:48:16) highly incentivizing types of work but I don't know that I don't know if it actually works out that way I don't know if that's true or not just not sure I

(2:48:24) wonder if like paying incentive structures is better like if we hit this performance like this kpi this key performance indicator if you achieve

(2:48:29) this metric then you get like a bonus payout rather than

(2:48:35) um rather than um like rev splits or whatever I don't

(2:48:41) know

(2:48:52) do you think Hassan will react to your new Jubilee video in its entirety o I'd be surprised if he would considering I'm trying to cancel him right now or I

(2:48:59) guess I'm invol I'm not really actually I guess I'm involved with somebody trying to cancel him

(2:49:04) um like what's he going to do cover me davora against a bunch of unhinged conservatives probably not he's going to

(2:49:10) cover me favorably a bunch of people he's never right so it's

(2:49:16) like who knows I could be wrong I'd be surpris surpris if he does

(2:49:30) though people like bald Goku already do enough work if you pay them they have even more time for it there's yeah I

(2:49:36) think I think so yeah yeah like I said after the election I'll start figuring that out more

(2:49:52) perhaps don't take on permanent artist stuff and just find a good talent manager I can find the right people for your Char maybe it's really really

(2:49:58) really hard um finding good talent is really hard I

(2:50:03) did find cuz I there's a couple of conversations like I said I have with people now who like I trust in the in

(2:50:09) the business world and I did find the answer because like finding like how do you find an employee that does high

(2:50:15) quality work that's very reliable how do you find these people and there actually is an answer cuz I was like where this

(2:50:20) the repository of these people where are they and I found the

(2:50:28) answer the answer is does anybody in chat know the

(2:50:42) answer oh oh yeah a few people are saying it the answer is you poach them that is the only answer answer the

(2:50:49) best talent you will ever find in your industry is talent that you poach every time um

(2:51:07) yeah for of you've already been asked this but have you read the skitso theories that Trum is going to attempt to coup again I don't know if we would

(2:51:14) call this a skitso theory but what you do about food election night

(2:51:20) small things that people Overlook uh I've got it all I have I have everything written down I've got I'm thinking about a lot of things I have like everybody

(2:51:25) when they're arriving when they're leaving um like flights times in and out and all that um I'll buy I'll stock up

(2:51:32) on like food stuffs and like drinks and stuff before um before the election day

(2:51:39) um I'll probably uh have like a Q&A with my staff before

(2:51:46) you I'll have it all we'll figure it out

(2:51:54) do I want this computer underneath this table or to the side of it probably underneath right can you explain the

(2:51:59) purpose of inviting people that aren't interesting in politics I think everybody that I'm that we've invited is probably going to have something to say

(2:52:06) no or will I contribute in some way um let me check

(2:52:24) [Music] okay iri is politics peace go is

(2:52:29) politics laner box is politics I think ABBA is like soop politically involved enough that he'll be fun to have here um

(2:52:36) same thing with like turkey Tom and Willie Mack they've obviously we've done through some of the j6 stuff they're fun guys to have around um the actman I got

(2:52:43) him to peel fly down irrelevant is obviously cool um and is politically

(2:52:48) active um Eon boy and Hutch couldn't make it I'm assuming D Park aren't coming based on what I saw on Reddit I

(2:52:54) looked that up um and I'm still waiting on confirmations from Josiah and

(2:53:12) mudahar is iri coming um he should be

(2:53:20) the pedo accusation clip pulling that up uh I

(2:53:34) guess literally our audience is losing their mind I'm sorry did is this did

(2:53:41) somebody sample the audio wrong or something up in their clip is this  up for everybody or just me why is this like doing a weird crackle thing

(2:53:48) [Music]

(2:53:56) it's just you I don't know if it's my iPad

(2:54:02) or the clip is sounds fine to me just

(2:54:11) you it's fine on my PC but on my phone somehow putting this video on

(2:54:17) right now everybody hates this guy Destiny well what can I do it's a it's a it's a it's their most recent

(2:54:23) Jubilee video this audio is  Defender dude fat Ethan wouldn't have played that

(2:54:30) that's all I'm saying you what what' you say I said fat Ethan would had played

(2:54:35) that okay we'll have to this is not he's not here we can ask him I miss

(2:54:43) him I mean dude it's there's 600,000 views in 4 hours this is a this is a

(2:54:48) this is a relevant video this is a relevant video you guys I can't help it I mean again yeah let's

(2:54:57) watch that again damn actually bullied out of it I was about to do a whole spiel about

(2:55:04) how he's actually a pedophile or some I don't know but the uh I guess I'll be nice I wish that

(2:55:10) like here's what I'll say if you hear insane about somebody

(2:55:16) like just ask for the clip like if I defend pedophiles that's

(2:55:21) probably going to be really well documented right like I imagine that's going to be really really really well documented somewhere that's a pretty big

(2:55:28) thing to be involved in is defending pedophiles especially considering that I have a son

(2:55:41) right good thing I wasn't a daughter just kidding joke

(2:55:51) wait do pedophiles have like sexual

(2:55:56) orientations like if you're a pedophile are there pedophiles who are like oh no no no no I don't want to look at a seven-year old girl that's gross I want

(2:56:02) to like a seven-year-old

(2:56:08) boy yes I can confirm

(2:56:19) because I feel like if you're because one of the things that makes you um sexually attracted to people are usually

(2:56:25) secondary sexual characteristics these are uh sexually dimorphic characteristics that develop as you go

(2:56:30) through puberty so for men it'll be the shapes of their bodies broader shoulders deeper voice stuff like like proportion

(2:56:36) of like fat and muscle for women it'll be wider hips whatever right um but if you're a pedophile and you're

(2:56:42) attracted to prepubescent people and those secondary sexual characteristics aren't presenting I wonder if they have like weaker attachments to

(2:56:49) um to being uh like attracted to a certain gender or whatever you know I don't know huh really makes you

(2:56:57) think okay what am I doing okay is this good do I want this is it going to be

(2:57:02) walking into the middle of this room and like running into this

(2:57:09) desk it's hard for you guys to see without me

(2:57:21) G I can't like I can barely turn

(2:57:29) this I'm just too lazy to move this back I can just move this back though like here's the divider thing

(2:57:35) light pull Studio here and then boom desk here it's just enough space for people to

(2:57:41) walk I think I should I should move the rim light a little actually am I even going to want

(2:57:47) the Rim light on on Election night probably aren't even going to want the rim lights cuz how are you going to rim light 20 people's heads

(2:57:57) right I probably will remove I will remove both of these I need to make a note of that actually I don't need

(2:58:15) these would you hate pedos who try not to to act on their urges and don't actually do it I feel like the only acting ped should be hated on yeah I

(2:58:21) mean there's technically there this is a point I hate these debates it's all virtue signaling there's nothing technically wrong with like being a

(2:58:27) pedophile let if you're kids or whatever is like the

(2:58:33) issue schedule um things to do uh we need to buy food

(2:58:41) stuffs uh remove rim lights

(2:58:46) [Music]

(2:58:57) [Music] oh I need to buy um this is got my main to do or no

(2:59:04) actually can just be here I need to I think I need to light this room I haven't bought any lights yet that's really important

(2:59:11) sure this

(2:59:28) um to give everyone a rim you do what's called cross back keying and it's old Studio television style of lighting but obviously would require more in-depth

(2:59:34) setup than you're likely looking to do I think if you want to get into that style of lighting I think that you want like you're talking about like studio so if

(2:59:43) you're getting into doing like real dgg  right if you're getting into like doing actual

(2:59:48) um setting up mini Studios like what I'm doing you get into stuff like buying SE stands right you could have like all these attachment systems to attach

(2:59:54) lights and all that but what you're talking about is I think you would actually need like um you'd want I

(3:00:00) don't know how you I don't know what you talk I don't know how what you call them but it's like actual like

(3:00:05) um uh not raffle what am I thinking of you build these in Minecraft out of

(3:00:11) wood and you climb on them what am I thinking of somebody tell me what the the word I'm thinking of

(3:00:18) scaffolding yeah um I think in real Studios you just have scaffolding built everywhere and then those are all built

(3:00:24) to spec and then you can attach lights and all and cameras and on everything and it's like super like easy to to do

(3:00:30) everything um in another world would I have bought scaffolding for this room probably not I don't think I would ever go that far in an apartment

(3:00:41) [Music] room Square frames or triangle

(3:00:46) frames acknowledge my fan camera

(3:00:55) idea your last Vlogs are8 days ago it's not working sorry not scaffolding it's called trust but not necessarily I'm the

(3:01:02) guy who did the C demo video by the way I also got the Hulu commercial on Dancing site wait wait are you the guy that emailed me

(3:01:09) the the super clamp video that Bo you broke your

(3:01:14) scale are you listening to the music or just us I am too you

(3:01:25) he puts the camera on a fan and it will switch back and forth to each room oh

(3:01:30) nice is that apartment of neighbors yes do you ever get noise complaints no I think the walls are pretty thick like my

(3:01:36) dick why did you go for an apartment Studio instead of a more traditional commercial space um when we initially

(3:01:42) conceptualized this place one it was really hard to find traditional it was hard to find Studio

(3:01:48) in Miami Beach it was just hard to find places to rent that were like fully and it was expensive like thousands of

(3:01:54) dollars a month um just all that uh it was it was

(3:01:59) really expensive it was really difficult um and we couldn't find a place close by like sometimes we found places but it

(3:02:05) would be like a 45 minute or like an hour drive and the idea of like having to do that every all that um

(3:02:12) just that  and then initially we figured if we set a studio up in here because studi

(3:02:17) seemed like so hard to find in this area um we were like part of the business model initially for this studio part of

(3:02:24) the business model initially was um uh to rent this studio out to other people although we've been in that

(3:02:31) concept that wasn't Dan saying it would be super cheap I like my to be nice and professional and okay

(3:02:37) beautiful all right you can find cheaper  but

(3:02:51) [Music] should going on fish tank as a cameo they keep trying to get me to go but I'm

(3:02:57) never no I'm good I'm Gucci I'm Gucci

(3:03:08) King I don't think I've ever heard acman talk about politics what prompted him having him over for election content we

(3:03:13) did a little bit on stream he was on the j6 thing and then he started to debate it a little bit but you know how you going to move if your studio is all set

(3:03:18) up here now I'm never moving I'm trapped

(3:03:24) here but um I mean if I move I move but I will be

(3:03:29) taking my stuff with me though I won't just be abandoning it like last time although I think it would be fun to set up another Studio like knowing

(3:03:34) everything I know now too like there there are things I would probably do differently but whatever

(3:03:40) okay computer is here um

(3:03:55) what is this connected to that light

(3:04:20) oh I also need to there's another thing I need to do

(3:04:30) um sometimes I change where things are plugged in if it like is more neat for the wires but when I was doing the

(3:04:35) thermostat install the other day and I flipped all the circuits uh I realized cuz my stream shut off and a bunch of

(3:04:40) in here shut off I realized that I unplugged stuff from the backup battery part to just the surge protector part so

(3:04:46) I need to make sure that all that is wired correctly okay that's there

(3:04:52) um power cable where is the power cable for this computer right here

(3:05:14) [Music]

(3:05:22) oh  I need this to not be a cluster

(3:05:31) oh YouTube chat I see you guys over there

(3:05:58) [Music] is there not a wall outlet over oh there

(3:06:03) is oh this is so much more convenient actually

(3:06:20) you do know the screen is black um oh cuz I unug I unplugged the camera yeah

(3:06:26) just chill doesn't this have a battery in it though open oh it

(3:06:34) doesn't well see look it's another good thing to learn okay do I have batteries here

(3:06:59) if I'm in here

(3:07:24) there we go cute okay there it is

(3:07:41) okay oh okay I'm going to change my mic again to work for Discord loop back turn it on okay don't

(3:07:51) forget to tell me to change that just in case anybody

(3:08:01) joins battery you think this battery's charged at

(3:08:08) all oh cute it is

(3:08:24) shut the

(3:08:35) up how many different software buses are you running do you have to swap back and forth there's no way you used all 10 right no I didn't I think I I'll

(3:08:41) probably um I should write this actually I should write on my too I should just clone that chain that I have and create

(3:08:48) another clone it and then set that to a loop back and then I can use that for this Discord it's just the use cases where I'm um talking on Discord on the

(3:08:56) studio PC is very rare but

(3:09:02) um uh what are we looking at Studio

(3:09:08) integration for Discord audio

(3:09:22) the guy who spoke to you in Spanish told you to learn Spanish L bro but he was speaking bad Spanish himself he probably doesn't speak that much and he probably

(3:09:30) um uh he was I think he was also probably nervous actually that's not true he

(3:09:36) probably does speak a decent amount of Spanish but I don't maybe he was just nervous we might guess

(3:09:47) or he rehearsed it I guess that could be it too maybe he literally practiced that and that's why it wasn't as clean as he

(3:09:53) wanted it to be but I don't [Applause] know was I nervous um honest to God on

(3:10:01) the Trump stuff just not not much anymore being able to read on viance has helped me so much like now

(3:10:07) I'm not like as like remember before I'd always be like oh I don't know if I can debate conspiracy theorist like there's always so much to learn and blah blah

(3:10:13) blah like I'm not worried about like that anymore um

(3:10:20) um here

(3:10:27) sure and then this light is plugged in

(3:10:32) here does the rim light need to be on the surge protector probably not or I

(3:10:38) mean on the battery backup no okay this is good this is good that goes over there

(3:10:58) do you think Jubilee finds strange people more for entertainment or to make broad statements of the makeup of a political side

(3:11:05) um I don't know it's might be it just might be hard to find same people that defend Trump oh yeah the second part of

(3:11:11) that answer is I really do feel bad for people that have to defend Trump that's a hard um that's a really

(3:11:19) hard proposition like I feel like they should be more nervous than than

(3:11:33) me okay [Music]

(3:11:39) um let's see computer

(3:11:45) cable it's a short

(3:11:50) run from here to here from here to here here to

(3:12:02) here did you find those cameras yesterday yes I have both of them

(3:12:26) is that a 240 volt extension cable uh I have no idea us us St is

(3:12:33) usually uh 120 not 240 240 is Europe This is rated for

(3:12:41) 125 us is usually 125 or 120 to 125 I think

(3:12:51) the community is so poisoned but against you yeah I mean yeah what do you want me to say I mean yeah like I said for the pedophile Defender I mean like all

(3:12:57) I can tell people is like watch a clip of me like I'm not like I don't defend

(3:13:03) pedophiles I also but I also don't like I don't freak the out over it The Virtue signal over it is just weird

(3:13:09) the idea of like people like world like bro when people do like

(3:13:14) that people think I'm meaning when I say this but especially after all the I've seen politically now that's hyper sus to me like that's I don't know I

(3:13:22) think that's really weird when people are like so defensive and like nervous

(3:13:28) and like have to Signal how much of a anti pedophile they are like I don't know it just seems like seems like

(3:13:34) you're uh got some stuff got some demons there okay how would this work like

(3:13:40) this and then plugged in here where we go one down boom boom

(3:13:48) now we can go down here this is

(3:13:55) fine but like I feel like I'm like the least I don't need to Signal any sexual or whatever like I feel

(3:14:02) like I have a pretty big track record I've been a streamer for a long time and I remember with a lot of people I've never been

(3:14:08) like incredibly accused of raping fny

(3:14:14) Jesus or any kids

(3:14:27) [Music]

(3:14:36) all I'm saying is if you don't think Hamas did Mass

(3:14:41) rapes how can you think I did I

(3:14:51) oh can I tuck this under the leg yes I can oh my God and under this

(3:14:59) leg wait

(3:15:15) beautiful okay ah honey scratching me he cucked me

(3:15:28) hard you do defend Lolli porn I mean when you say defend Lolli porn I just don't think it should be illegal to draw

(3:15:40) don't think it be illegal to draw pictures what do you want me to say this is the godamn us of

(3:15:48) a if I want to draw a thousand-year-old

(3:17:31) you're going to show us your cable management my cable management is beautiful okay but I don't think there's a way to like wirelessly walk around

(3:17:38) well there is I just don't have a wireless HDMI to show you how beautiful everything is set up okay

(3:17:53) like oh like you'd think look at oh my God like look at that look at that all

(3:17:59) of these are tied they're like brand this is like the messiest part is right there but all of these are like tied

(3:18:05) together at like multiple points all moving in like one coherent branch of

(3:18:10) cabling oh my God all along the wall over there you can see them wait

(3:18:18) oh it's just it's beautiful in here okay it's just beautiful all

(3:18:24) [Applause]

(3:18:41) right did you fix the microphone settings after the Andro thing yeah but I changed it back in case anybody joins my Discord so

(3:18:47) you need to hide that under the floor uh I super disagree um I've tried to hide cables under the carpet before but the

(3:18:54) or well under the floor could but under the carpet it doesn't work because um uh you can feel it when you step on

(3:18:59) it and it's just it's not a good feeling not a good feeling okay um okay I need to get this set up

(3:19:25) re the Jubilee video on the bipartisan border bill I believe the bill increases the standard Revenant required to approve an asylum that might be a good

(3:19:30) thing to emphasize in future debates yeah but I don't I don't even think they care about that that is true though it does make it a little bit harder to qualify but they they there is no PO you

(3:19:38) can see them like jump from one point to the next where'd you get those pants that's

(3:19:43) top secret and by top secret I mean everything probably came from

(3:19:53) [Music]

(3:20:01) Lululemon is I re have I reacted to Jubilee video thumbnail yet nope what time do you want the election stream to

(3:20:07) start on my schedule I have it written in at 12: but I mean it could start as early as 9: or 10 I don't

(3:20:12) know the only like unsettled question I have right now is I'm not too sure what I want to do for like camera and

(3:20:18) production

(3:20:29) [Music]

(3:20:43) yet thumbnails changed like five times uh it's pretty common on on YouTube you can ab test stuff in the behind the

(3:20:48) scenes pretty easily so different people might see different thumbnails and then it might switch out based on which one does

(3:21:07) better 49 State Landslide for comma bro didn't you see it's going to be a 50 state Landslide for Trump after that

(3:21:13) amazing New York rally Trump's going to win everywhere can you explain why Dan wanted two

(3:21:19) streams to be watched Ki doesn't pay a lot for ads does it um Ki does pay a decent amount for ads that's why um well

(3:21:25) not really ads it's like a different kind of program but that's why Dan wants to drive traffic to it a lot I'd like to

(3:21:31) drive traffic to it as well it's nice it's just not like my priority and I won't do anything um on that stream that

(3:21:36) would take away from the YouTube stream because my my number one goal is always like eyes on like I'm just trying to get

(3:21:42) the most viewers possible and I don't want to sacrifice that that being said I still think I can have stuff on the kick

(3:21:47) stream that would be worth watching hopefully this data stuff is interesting but okay

(3:21:55) um I need

(3:22:19) are you running any odds for your election stream um I mean

(3:22:30) if somebody wants to pay for a sponsor I mean YouTube runs them I think automatically

(3:22:36) right I know you had to deal with Rumble you left abruptly were the rumble guys pissed at you or were they understanding they were pretty mad and I was like a

(3:22:42) little bit scummy like I I I'm sympathetic towards Chris being a a little upset I'm not he's not he was

(3:22:48) like a baby he wasn't like super mad or anything but like like interpersonally it was like pretty shitty like we'd had dinner and

(3:23:01) [Music]

(3:23:10) [Music] everything what did you do

(3:23:17) um I'm listen I'm not speaking to any Rumble practices like past or present um

(3:23:22) or anything like that um I'll just say that the contract that

(3:23:28) I had gotten for my deal seemed like very boilerplate like they C like gotten it somewhere um but the termination

(3:23:35) Clause was written far too favorably to the talent which I guess is like maybe a credit to them but the um the

(3:23:43) termination clause in my contract basically just said all you have to do do is give 30 days notice and there were no other requirements for termination

(3:23:50) usually in my professional opinion which I can give as a professional um

(3:23:56) termination Clauses should require some kind of material breach of contract that

(3:24:01) the other side has been given to chance to remedy and they fail to do so in a set amount of time generally that's how termination Clauses are written usually

(3:24:08) there's not like a no fa termination Clause with just 30-day written notice but mine did have that so basically I

(3:24:13) was just able to message him and say like hey sorry I'm just letting you know like I'm leaving in 30 days after they' already announced My Signing which is

(3:24:19) mean interpersonal that's a shitty thing to do and yeah he was like hold on like we're running this through legal like I

(3:24:24) don't think this is okay and I'm like okay well let me know when you guys have reread [Music]

(3:24:44) it you didn't get paid right I mean I got paid for the time I was there I I paid them back I I was like

(3:24:51) listen I'm sorry I'll send you back like the the last month you guys pay me CU I felt bad I really should feel bad I

(3:24:58) guess these guys are all rich I don't know I'm a sucker

(3:25:30) I need a list of confirmed election night streamers

(3:25:41) um I mean I can tell you it's iri peace go loner box Abba Turkey Tom wiie Mac

(3:25:46) the act man and a relevant that's what I have right now was this a new contract after your

(3:25:52) old one was done how much time did it have this was the year deal that I sign with

(3:26:00) Rumble and potentials um I'm waiting on confirmation from Josiah and

(3:26:09) [Music] mudahar do I ever need this standing

(3:26:15) desk like plugged in like is it ever going to be moving up and down you know what it dude is aidite going um oh yeah I mean

(3:26:23) Kyla me and Dan will be there

(3:26:43) too do I really want this plugged in I don't think I do I don't think I care no that we don't need this

(3:27:00) supposedly xqc will make a physical appearance and train Rex will make a

(3:27:05) digital appearance I have low confidence in either of those people doing it but we'll see

(3:27:39) do kids ever do Halloween around Miami Beach I have no clue you should have invited did

(3:27:47) myun true maybe actually but I'm sure they should be doing their own election stream

(3:28:08) right software do you use for organizing your event I do almost everything in obsidian um I don't know if obsidian is

(3:28:15) the best some people recommend commend I think notation and Trello Trello might be specifically for task organizing

(3:28:24) but um one one thing that I the one the what I do with obsidian is I have like I've got short-term medium-term and

(3:28:30) long-term tasks so like short-term things are things that I should be doing every morning at night medium-term are things I should be doing every Wednesday

(3:28:36) morning and then long-term are when my short and medium terms are done I work on my long-term stuff on Wednesday

(3:28:42) Saturday Sunday and I just bucket everything into those three groups and that's how I usually organize

(3:28:50) [Music] [Applause] cast but there are other programs that are more sophisticated when it comes to

(3:28:56) managing tasks I think with other people

(3:29:02) [Music]

(3:29:09) [Music] so kind of ran up but who was that

(3:29:16) twitch employee that came into your Twitch chat a bit before your Perma ban saying he needed to talk to you uh I

(3:29:21) don't know who was that what was their

(3:29:30) name will there be alcohol during election night stream um I haven't decided about that yet if there is I

(3:29:37) would probably have to restrict it around um oh I should be back think um I

(3:29:42) have to probably restrict the time for drinking or I would have to actually like keep tabs on people's

(3:29:49) drinking and could do like a like a red light green light yellow

(3:30:09) light you just do beers and white claws no liquor I can't tell if you guys are either people that never drink or if you

(3:30:16) guys are people that drink way too much I don't know why you would say just do white claws like people can't get  wasted on

(3:30:25) seltzers you can absolutely get wasted on

(3:30:42) seltzers how ugly me these power aren't long enough well hold

(3:30:49) on why is getting drunk bad um I don't know why this is the case but

(3:30:57) it seems like socially people aren't supposed to like get drunk and then get sober again like when you're drunk

(3:31:02) you're supposed to be drunk until the day ends so like it's it's socially unacceptable to get drunk at like 2: p.m. and then to be sober at 600 p.m. I

(3:31:09) don't know why that is the case but because that's the case if somebody gets drunk early on in the day then it seem

(3:31:15) seem like they have to clock out and like leave and that's that would just get like really awkward and I don't want to have a situation where I'm having to

(3:31:22) babysit or manage like legitimately wasted people um the potential for drama

(3:31:29) or really bad things to happen is way too

(3:31:35) high G this is so gross well isn't that gross

(3:31:58) it this is

(3:32:05) fun so if we do do drinking it'll probably be I'll either be like limiting the amount of drinks to probably like

(3:32:12) one drink per hour or maybe two if we want to get a little drunk TIY um and

(3:32:17) it'll probably be restricted until a certain hour like after 7 or 8 maybe

(3:32:24) um yeah I don't know nobody is going to follow that uh

(3:32:30) everybody's going to follow it because this is my apartment and I will kick them the out if they don't that's pretty

(3:32:36) easy what do we got here HDMI ports what comes out of the back of this display

(3:32:41) ports wow good good job and these are are all HDMI cables please

(3:32:47) tell me they come with display port

(3:33:02) cables what about food probably just ordering piezas bro are we serious right now this is a 1080 TI how does it only

(3:33:09) output three display ports and one HDMI

(3:33:15) [Music]

(3:33:21) [Applause] let's see do I need an active adapter

(3:33:27) for outputting display to HDMI or can it be a passive adapter I think I have

(3:33:36) both this is display port HDMI hopefully passive works

(3:34:10) do

(3:34:18) how late you think Go cover the election votes probably until like um Mr Bond I don't know midnight uh no

(3:34:26) no I'm sorry three or four h we need to who just joined hello he it's

(3:34:33) I vegan games oh hi what's up oh not much uh had a bit of a crazy

(3:34:42) thing happened to me on the highway today what happened some guy uh literally tried to kill me

(3:34:49) um he was just Road raging super hard this uh dip when I was changing

(3:34:55) lanes deliberately sped up and uh nearly hit me then when I passed him and gave

(3:35:01) him the finger he tried to run me over and then uh I was literally in a high-s

(3:35:06) speed chase for like a minute that's pretty uh pretty

(3:35:13) wild but I did get some good V Chinese food so it was worth it did the guy end

(3:35:20) up getting like pulled over anything or no uh it's actually extraordinarily

(3:35:27) easy to uh speed in Canada like just about anywhere well I mean did he get pulled

(3:35:33) over for like road rage chasing you well I didn't get his license played

(3:35:38) and there weren't any cops around so yeah okay all right well that sucks yeah that guy was a

(3:35:46) nut job just absolutely whacked yeah I mean he sounds like it yeah yeah somebody was asking if I was

(3:35:53) riding the Euro no the eural is way too slow to like I no way you could run away from

(3:36:01) somebody on that bike I was on my vrom oh you on like a b like a

(3:36:06) motorcycle or yeah I was on I was on my motorcycle were you on the

(3:36:11) interstate no uh just 400 series Highway oh I feel like you should be able to

(3:36:17) outrun him or get away from him pretty easily then now yeah I I was able to get him away uh

(3:36:23) from him pretty quickly but um he like there was traffic

(3:36:29) in front of me so I had to kind of weave in and out of cars and I couldn't really gun it um for a little bit and he was

(3:36:36) weaving in and out too so he was keeping up with me for a little but then I got

(3:36:42) up to 200 km an hour and and uh I actually ended up uh speed

(3:36:52) wobbling oh there we go well good thing you're still

(3:36:59) alive yeah I'm pretty robust I think even if I

(3:37:04) crashed I probably would have lived sure although crashes are scary

(3:37:10) you don't want to like get like big permanent injuries or whatever right well yeah yeah uh I don't want to

(3:37:17) like break anything or anything like that but I I had my motorcycle jacket and pants and everything on like all

(3:37:23) Kevlar sure okay probably would have avoided road

(3:37:30) rash all right man well take care I just had some THC gummies and I'm waiting for

(3:37:36) them to kick in all right well be careful stay safe yeah happy Halloween

(3:37:43) yep happy Halloween

(3:37:52) nice okay um keyboard and

(3:37:58) [Music]

(3:38:06) mouse should hire a bartender yeah

(3:38:13) [Music] you reach out to Woody's gamertag for

(3:38:19) doing an episode um no but I feel bad cuz I feel like I've been I like haven't going on their podcast the last few

(3:38:24) times they reached out so but I feel like I've done their show like three times right

(3:38:33) [Music]

(3:38:48) any plans about feeding people Pizza bro I learned that when I did the canvasing stuff Pizza is like the golden

(3:38:54) um oh e what kind of keyboard is

(3:39:00) this please tell me lithium ion and I don't have to put alkaline batteries in Pizza is like the cheat code to feeding

(3:39:07) lots of people cheaply everything else is way too expensive even like doing even Hing like sandwiches and gets

(3:39:13) like absurdly expensive and in terms of like calories to um calories to

(3:39:20) [Music]

(3:39:29) [Music] cost is the is the voting votings trends

(3:39:36) guy on YouTube you got for the stream or is it just a coincidence that he's in Miami I don't know who voting trends is

(3:39:43) we might be doing a show with that guy though for [Applause]

(3:40:23) [Music]

(3:40:33) I will tie every single cable here because I do not give a

(3:40:50) how you get direct voting data I was curious how that works um there are three companies that have a whole staff

(3:40:56) full of people who either query um the

(3:41:02) apis from election sites uh like County voting data that is

(3:41:08) um made available to the public via apis or they have scrapers for websites that

(3:41:14) don't have an API or um they also employ like dozens of people I think to

(3:41:20) manually refresh sites and record data if it's not being like listed in a coherent clean way that can be scraped

(3:41:26) or apied accessed um there's not like a place to hold this

(3:41:33) there are three companies that do that and one of the three I think I can say because we're going to advertise their name on the stream the ddhq people are

(3:41:39) working with us um

(3:41:47) what's your front end for it um they I'm programming the front end that's why I learned python no they I

(3:41:54) think they have a service where they basically provide the front end for everything

(3:42:16) [Applause]

(3:42:38) do you the guy you hired uh know about Which counties to look at for the swing States many maybe some other B counties

(3:42:45) yeah yeah he's like I said he flies in actually tomorrow afternoon um for us to like do streams and rehearsals and

(3:42:52) so yeah he's got he's good for all of it or at least he marketed himself as good for it so I guess we'll find

(3:43:11) out any chance to get Lauren Shan to call in an election I have read some opinions predic about the outcome will be do we need a translator for

(3:43:28) that this cable is

(3:43:35) not you know what there going to be some cables hanging back here I don't give a  it's

(3:43:42) fine if they need to stretch let let my people

(3:44:05) stretch okay trash trash trash

(3:44:18) [Applause]

(3:44:24) [Applause]

(3:44:47) I think I have a few extra mice yes finally all this extra that I

(3:44:52) have laying around is paying

(3:45:09) off you see the unbelievable amount of backlash Biden Harris got when bid accidentally called mag supps garbage meanwhile Trump L yeah they should own

(3:45:15) it dude say whoops get  I haven't even seen Biden's

(3:45:20) original statement some people were saying that Biden didn't even actually say that or that it's being taken out of I don't know if that's true or not

(3:45:30) but where's my little pocket knife hello

(3:45:38) [Music]

(3:45:50) what did I cut open last who was watching the

(3:45:56) [Music]

(3:46:08) stream he 100% did call his supporters garbage oh well get

(3:46:16) did he just say like randomly like Trump supporters are garbage or was it something like I can't believe he made

(3:46:22) these comments about like Puerto Rico like Trump supporters are garbage or whatever like was it in the context of

(3:46:29) those Puerto Rican uh the Puerto Rican joke things or was it just like

(3:46:35) randomly he said the only garbage I see are his support oh okay yeah all right in that case yeah Biden for

(3:46:43) apologizing all right what do we got

(3:46:49) um here and

(3:46:56) here

(3:47:05) whoa Chad is gaslighting you oh did he not do that did he say the other whoa

(3:47:10) hello why doesn't this work what

(3:47:26) can somebody link me the quote I just want to listen to it

(3:47:56) Donald Trump has no character he doesn't Doo Community true he's failed

(3:48:02) businessman he he only cares about the billionaire friends he has and accumulating wealth for those true he

(3:48:08) says immigrants are poisoning the blood of our country give me a break true he wants to do away with the birth right

(3:48:14) citizenship said that in the last 100 years and just the other day a speaker at his rally

(3:48:20) called Puerto Rico a floating island of garbage well let me tell you something I

(3:48:25) don't I I don't know the Puerto Rican that that I know or Puerto Rico where

(3:48:30) I'm in my home state of Delaware they're good decent honorable people we got there garbage I see floating out there

(3:48:36) is his supporters B true demonization uncons and it's on America it's totally

(3:48:43) contrary to everything done everything we B all right IO sign that

(3:48:59) [Music]

(3:49:11) statement you rather he not had not said that so to not undermine K's Unity message um honest to God I'm a little

(3:49:18) bit worried about that right now I don't know if kala should be playing to the unity thing as much or playing up the Bas as much I don't think when kamla

(3:49:24) gets in I don't think she should be appointing like Republican people like  anywhere maybe actually I take

(3:49:30) that back I think that if they are like never trumpers I think that those people should be appointed um nobody that has

(3:49:37) been associated with Maga should have any position in the United States government ever again in my opinion um

(3:49:43) so none of those people ever she said one person L chainy okay yeah that's fine to magga people never trumpers are

(3:49:49) basically Communists anyway so and people like kinzinger yeah that's [Music]

(3:50:09) fine what about Romney I think Romney is a never Trumper how does Romney survive

(3:50:15) being a never Trumper doesn't he fight with Trump a lot but he still is like popular how does that work is it just

(3:50:20) cuz he's so like embedded in that state me make sure he's still a senator

(3:50:26) and I'm not   yeah

(3:50:33) okay is it just like the Mormon thing is that

(3:50:42) it he's not running again oh oh well how long has he

(3:50:48) been fighting with um Trump hasn't he been fighting with Trump since the beginning he must have had an election

(3:50:53) since then segregation separ would you go to Destiny's election stream event if he invited you um maybe you

(3:51:02) [Music] know I'll think about it a lot of people signed up so far

(3:51:10) [Music]

(3:51:21) I need slack for

(3:51:26) [Music]

(3:51:36) this my face when this computer doesn't even work anymore

(3:51:43) [Music]

(3:51:49) I know

(3:52:16) [Music]

(3:52:24) [Music] okay close

(3:52:33) [Music] enough

(3:52:38) okay in a perfect world I have a copy of Windows 11

(3:52:43) install on a FL drive

(3:52:49) somewhere is it on this oh my

(3:53:13) goodness and got carried away too much in the Jubilee thing a few times you those people were insane if anything

(3:53:19) I was way too

(3:53:33) passive

(3:53:41) um what am I looking for uh

(3:53:58) um [Music]

(3:54:07) okay hopefully this is bootable hopefully this computer still

(3:54:13) works [Music]

(3:54:21) um I need ethernet I have a cable but

(3:54:28) it's like 75 ft long it's way too  long oh wait I should have other ethernet CIB still

(3:54:37) right all of these cables are super long

(3:54:56) it

(3:55:21) how do you feel about the guy who's being super nice to in the Jubilee video the guy that I brought on to talk to at the

(3:55:26) end um he's a nice guy to chat with but a little bit crazy but

(3:55:48) why are we all saying Steven is Hutch not coming

(3:56:01) no oh my God actually I wonder if he would come to the election stream cuz he

(3:56:07) lives down here and he would actually be a um it would be one conservative we could have

(3:56:16) [Music]

(3:56:27) do you know how on top of the world that guy would be if Trump won the one conservative

(3:56:40) here okay um since power is already running

(3:56:45) that way I could run the ethernet cable along the wall that way or I could run it along with the rest of them who

(3:56:51) joined hello hi it's vegan gains again hi yeah I wanted to ask you a question I

(3:56:59) saw that you were on Jubilee whereas like one Democrat versus 25 Trump

(3:57:05) voters could you contact them and see if they would be interested to do one vegan

(3:57:10) versus 25 meat eaters with like me yeah sure I kind of friendly with the

(3:57:16) producer I can like suggest it to her yeah yeah when we chat next okay sweet that'd be awesome dude thank

(3:57:22) you yeah all

(3:57:29) right I'm very high nice take care though be

(3:57:35) careful okay how do you guys feel okay I have an emotional feeling about this but I don't know if it's like a good um

(3:57:42) practice so right now the internet comes out of the

(3:57:48) modem at the other end of the room over there and the cables for the internet for two cables because I got two PCS

(3:57:54) that are hooked up the studio PC and the set PC they run along the floor down there and then they come out from behind the couch and they go over there okay I

(3:58:01) don't have any cables run along the wall down here now if I wanted to connect an

(3:58:07) Ethernet cable to this computer to that modem the the shortest path would be

(3:58:12) from here and then I would come along down here and then I would go along the wall over there or I could run a cable

(3:58:20) along with the other cables that are already ran and I could go this way over here and then through the wall over there so that it's lined up with all the

(3:58:26) other cables I want to go I want to run with all the other cables cuz it feels

(3:58:31) neater but it's technically a longer path and might be more

(3:58:39) autistic go with the other cables hell yeah okay BAS true and

(3:58:53) based Let's see we

(3:59:00) got plug in here

(3:59:06) [Music]

(3:59:32) so all my slack is going it's in this

(3:59:38) corner and then it has two onboard eanet ports

(3:59:43) crazy okay please just turn on and work my face when this transplant doesn't

(3:59:49) work for some

(4:00:12) reason okay what am I looking for

(4:00:20) [Music]

(4:00:27) okay turn on and work oh my

(4:00:32) [Music] god oh no it didn't turn

(4:00:38) [Music] around it's turning off immediately why oh oh no I cable manag and

(4:00:46) everything before testing this why did I do that what could be happening I've never

(4:00:52) had I've never had a computer turn off immediately after turning it on

(4:01:18) I wonder if the cables are

(4:01:25) wrong it's not the ram I didn't touch the Ram or the CPU when I transplanted

(4:01:35) this H maybe that a pin's not seated all the

(4:01:41) way oh

(4:02:04) what would happen if I use the wrong power supply cables does anybody actually know

(4:02:20) all these seem seated reset the

(4:02:28) [Music] seos yeah I was thinking the Magic Smoke

(4:02:34) would come out um nope holy we got Big Boy issues um

(4:02:49) oh wait what is this button does that do anything no oh

(4:03:08) why the cables are not compatible you would not be able to plug them in um I don't believe that's true

(4:03:14) actually you can if you switch cables between power supplies you can plug them in and they will not be uh the pins will

(4:03:20) not be correct you shouldn't be able to plug

(4:03:27) like a PCI Express cable into a um into like a other like a CPU slot that's true

(4:03:34) but you should um but you can mix and match PCU PSU power cables and the pin

(4:03:39) configurations can be different which can um I don't know what the worst cases I imagine fry your

(4:03:55) H computer turns on but immediately shuts off no error

(4:04:03) code problems include faulty power supply discharged battery overheating damage internal components bios issues

(4:04:08) software problems software how faulty power button electrical shorts

(4:04:15) oh no me does this have like a motherboard start button I guess you can

(4:04:21) start it from the couse button

(4:04:29) [Music]

(4:04:35) [Music]

(4:04:44) [Music] you get a cable that is not part of the

(4:04:49) p and from a different brand I did a case transplant but I don't think

(4:04:58) um I don't think I Mi I don't think I mixed any the power cords up I'm pretty sure I kept everything separate but I was like there's like a 10% chance that

(4:05:03) maybe I up the power I don't think so

(4:05:10) though holy what just happened [Music]

(4:05:31) [Music]

(4:05:40) why a

(4:05:54) the case is plugged into the reset pins instead of the power pins I mean if I hit the seos button on the back it does

(4:06:00) the exact same

(4:06:11) thing this hybrid mode if I turn the PSU off in the back and

(4:06:18) then I turn the PSU on the lights come on there's Lighting

(4:06:23) on the board and everything now right so there's like passive power or

(4:06:29) whatever the to the board right now but then if I tap

(4:06:34) the um if I tap the seos button to start it

(4:06:44) oh tapping the SE button doesn't do anything right now hold

(4:07:00) on if I power it up it turns on for like half a second and then it turns off and

(4:07:05) now there's no passive power to the board

(4:07:15) [Music] I would check the power and restart pins that go from the case to the motherboard

(4:07:20) it's all in one thing like you can't even there's not even options to wire it differently it comes out of the case the

(4:07:26) motherboard or it comes out of the case headers as one unit unless there's like different things you could attach it

(4:07:32) to but I think there's only like one front panel plugin yeah

(4:07:43) oh I've never had this problem

(4:08:07) before maybe a cable's not seated I guess open up the back and check

(4:08:12) I don't want to deal with computer trouble shooting problems you

(4:08:37) know did you with the cooler no I left the the RAM and the cooler and all that was left alone when I transplanted

(4:08:54) let's see PSU PSU

(4:09:10) PSU take the seos out and wait 5 minutes

(4:09:20) really you plug in the four pin it's I mean it's two eight pin connectors and yes they are plugged

(4:09:26) in PSU

(4:09:38) PSU okay these are plugged into the CPU SL p C part of the PSU which is where

(4:09:46) they're supposed to go this is peripheral IDE SATA Molex yes

(4:09:53) this is SATA for this drive back here it sounds like a short yeah it does

(4:10:00) but what the could possibly be  shorting oh

(4:10:39) I don't know why I'm plugging this in and trying again because nothing is going to happen

(4:11:05) I bro I'm going to kill myself in a video game

(4:11:32) you

(4:11:50) check the 24 pin connector for power to your motherboard I mean it's all connected but I don't think it would I

(4:11:56) don't think it would power on for like half a second and then power off

(4:12:03) right do I have to start unplugging Bruh Bruh

(4:12:12) Bruh oh okay GPU

(4:12:24) first you should look up the LED signal from the mother there is no LED thing it turns on and then off instantly my dude

(4:12:30) there is no there is no LED signal

(4:12:46) why oh cuz I screwed it in what a loser why would I screw anything in can I just leave this in the PCI Express slot if

(4:12:52) it's not powered it shouldn't matter right check the voltage switch on the

(4:13:00) PSU I'm sorry what year is this voltage switch on the PSU

(4:13:13) good

(4:13:50) okay NB 101 PSU

(4:13:56) [Music]

(4:14:07) cable oh God Is there a way where I can look up like

(4:14:19) which cables come with which

(4:14:37) PSU manual in a PSU box yeah you think I kept that

(4:15:09) GPU PCI E-1 CPU pcie this shouldn't matter

(4:15:23) right okay be 25 there's no way that I would have kept

(4:15:33) pong there's no way I would have I would have this up

(4:15:41) right hold on Okay C

(4:16:07) Sonic orders orders b b b

(4:16:16) power

(4:16:23) supply oh my God what is it

(4:16:31) called your ORD search see Sonic

(4:16:43) you check the motherboard screws bro cases today come with literally built-in standoffs it's not that there this case

(4:16:49) has built-in standoffs okay see Sonic Focus PX 750

(4:16:59) that's what this is

(4:17:05) right how is there not a model number written on this in an easily accessible

(4:17:11) spot it says focus on the back so I'm assuming that's that must be what this is okay

(4:17:22) [Music]

(4:17:32) [Music]

(4:17:43) see Sonic Focus

(4:17:54) 750 manual user

(4:18:11) manual holy AIDS what is this AIDS ass website what the

(4:18:16) manual. LS no Christ no see Sonic here we go oh I clicked the

(4:18:23) sponsored link cuz I'm

(4:18:28) [Music]

(4:18:45) manual manual manual manual manual I don't want

(4:18:53) pictures cables oh wait it says it oh my God can you just tell me the like the

(4:19:00) what's written on the side of the cable oh

(4:19:07) no user manual

(4:19:16) [Music]

(4:19:25) accessories labeled wait does that link have like what's written on the sides of the cables this the manual doesn't are

(4:19:31) you [Music]

(4:19:38) [Music] serious how absolutely

(4:19:44) cringe data sheet would that have it download

(4:20:03) [Music]

(4:20:13) am I [Music] insane what is the these cables have

(4:20:21) numbers written on the side of them they must be referenced somewhere what the 

(4:20:46) power distribution connector quality

(4:21:04) [Music]

(4:21:19) what is this labeled be [Music] e25 okay be

(4:21:25) e25 PSU

(4:21:34) cable it cannot be the case that there's no documentation on like what cables the

(4:21:42) it this can't be the case it cannot be this this this isn't listed anywhere

(4:21:56) [Music]

(4:22:12) if it's number code printed on the side of the cable it could be from the actual cable manufacturer not the PSU maker whatever they wouldn't care what was

(4:22:19) printed on the cable and different vendors used would have oh oh so these might not even mean anything how the

(4:22:25) am I supposed to know the if it goes to this PSU then you just don't you

(4:22:30) just can't [Music] know try this C Sonic cable print

(4:22:39) outs yeah I'm ru

(4:23:15) okay I'm GNA kill myself we're just going to do that ASAP wait it wouldn't be

(4:23:21) the the wireless or the uninterruptible power supply

(4:23:30) right no it wouldn't be I don't even need to I don't even need to test that cuz there's no shot that would be the

(4:23:38) case that's okay you know what do we do but sit here and with computers all day

(4:23:50) can you even see me on this camera right now

(4:24:14) this is the

(4:24:25) um this is the issue right now so if I plug it in is there like a

(4:24:33) blue

(4:24:39) light okay now it's green blue whatever the

(4:24:45) okay now if I try to turn the computer on this is what it

(4:24:53) does wait hello it's turning on now

(4:24:59) why

(4:25:09) why no wait it's not turning on

(4:25:15) is it turning on the fans aren't

(4:25:30) spinning

(4:25:39) why it might be booting

(4:25:49) what oh this this chipset has no onboard Graphics so I can't even plug it in why would it be Memory training i' I've

(4:25:56) literally used this exact same build in other systems before

(4:26:12) oh wait what the wait I don't even have the eight pins plugged in on the for the motherboard power wait what hold

(4:26:26) on okay that's

(4:26:36) whatever Dan called it I don't even know if Dan could build a PC right now um no

(4:26:42) the issue is not that I didn't have them plugged in initially they were plugged in initially I'm just saying I just now unplugged them but it was still turning

(4:27:00) on okay try different

(4:27:06) slots okay fli up the switch the lights turning green instead of blue I don't

(4:27:13) know if that's good or

(4:27:18) not okay did it do it yeah so this is the issue so I don't know

(4:27:25) what's well I guess so it can't be a short right if the if it's if it turns on for a

(4:27:34) while what is I've never had a computer like turn on and turn off like this before

(4:27:44) 6 to8 pin is CPU power not motherboard

(4:28:04) [Music] yes what's up killer it's your

(4:28:11) mom I know this sounds can can you just try turning it on a few times like

(4:28:16) unironically sometimes these things are  stupid like you turn it on and it turns off every time right away yep

(4:28:23) any lights on the motherboard oh yeah there's just there's an error code but I just haven't read it or checked in on it at all I've just

(4:28:29) been ignoring that the whole time I'm just asking what it is cuz I haven't been watching your dumb stream for the last

(4:28:35) hour so what is the error code there is no error code it turns off too quickly

(4:28:52) [Music]

(4:29:00) I'm going to kill myself CPU not being seated enough would cause

(4:29:06) it h is that even a possible error yeah I I don't think

(4:29:15) so have you tried re like uh I'm not reting the CPU

(4:29:20) no okay so you have all the things plugged in and it's not shorting out I don't

(4:29:28) think it is I repair servers and it sounds like

(4:29:35) the CPU is overheating there's no shot that the CPU would overheat that quickly in one second no that's that's

(4:29:41) also not a one

(4:29:52) second have you tried um removing all of the peripherals um I

(4:30:00) mean kind of like I've removed um the I mean like I need the graphics

(4:30:06) card cuz it's I'm just curious if it'll actually turn on without the um with nothing in

(4:30:12) it there is a graphics card on that motherboard right there's a buil in not on this chipset there's no

(4:30:17) GPU cuz it's the 16 core zon chip or whatever do you have another GPU there I

(4:30:23) darus that one no I think I gave him the 1080 TI I mean I could see if it'll at least stay on without a

(4:30:29) graphics card in but I don't know what the expected behavior is of this uh machine with no GPU in well at least

(4:30:35) it'll tell us something if it turns on with nothing plugged into it at all

(4:30:43) because you can run computers without a graphics card like and you network into them right that's not like it's to I

(4:30:48) don't know if that's true for like well especially for a Zeon machine absolutely right I for a consumer Zeon

(4:30:55) machine like it like some of these will if you don't have um the if you don't

(4:31:01) have a GPU in like it won't it won't post I'm sure for like servers you don't need one but I don't know cuz these are

(4:31:07) even though it's a Zeon chip it's like a consumer chip but maybe who knows we'll check

(4:31:12) I mean let's see if it gets past one second right yeah start taking out all this

(4:31:18) I

(4:31:28) guess cocked and then

(4:31:54) [Music]

(4:32:04) doesn't like fried is it no okay

(4:32:21) disconnect from Power remove seos and discharge motherboard um I guess I could try that

(4:32:27) next

(4:32:36) [Music]

(4:32:49) okay wait hold no wait oops oh

(4:32:57) God I can't really see but when you turn it on

(4:33:04) um like the fans and turn on for a second or are you just like guessing it's turning on let me

(4:33:10) check nope yeah the fan spin for like maybe half maybe a quarter of a second the light on the motherboard turns on

(4:33:15) for maybe a quarter of a second um and then it turns

(4:33:25) off thinking and you basically have nothing

(4:33:32) plugged into this thing right now besides the main uh header for the motherboard and the eight pin for the

(4:33:38) processor and that's it right um I mean I've got three um three three pin case

(4:33:44) fan things plugged into the motherboard I've got the front panel thing the HD audio front panel thing and then just the CPU and the ram

(4:33:52) you have the um the I wonder if it's freaking out because maybe it doesn't see do you have the CPU fan plugged in

(4:33:57) to that CPU fan slot aware that sometimes that does happen but yeah it's in CPU slot one is there another

(4:34:05) slot for the CPU maybe it's and it thinks it has to be in the other one um I don't think so so this is what

(4:34:12) it was plugged into before and it's literally labeled CPU fan one unless there's a CPU fan zero um which I don't

(4:34:17) think there is [Music]

(4:34:23) um I just bought a whole new  computer just tell me the motherboard real quick and I um because

(4:34:29) I'll look it up while you're doing this or the model

(4:34:35) um me I know if it's written anywhere hold on I don't remember the

(4:34:41) CPU it's an as rock board [Music]

(4:34:48) um I don't remember the chip I have if it's a like 6970 or something that

(4:34:54) doesn't sound right oh wait

(4:35:02) x299 and then T

(4:35:07) CI yeah taichi okay um okay the X2 99 taii I got it uh August wants you to

(4:35:14) restart the kick stream stop and restart the kick stream I don't know why he says something where

(4:35:23) why August uh ask him if he can split VOD in the studio or not ask him to stop and

(4:35:29) restart the kick stream so I can NAB the kick stream I don't know let me look at let me look at this real

(4:35:37) quick let's see [Music]

(4:35:47) [Music]

(4:35:56) I'm going to click stop recording I'm going to click start recording hopefully that's doing

(4:36:03) everything it needs to do otherwise the

(4:36:09) world oh okay somebody said remove the

(4:36:15) SOS take out the ram guys I can't taking out the ram is going to be a whole last thing I think you have to take this heat

(4:36:20) sink off to get to the ram I'm looking for a diagram this piece of sh

(4:36:31) [Music]

(4:36:45) how are you supposed to take this  battery

(4:36:53) [Music]

(4:37:09) out oh my God you know

(4:37:20) what there how long does this need to be out for the motherboard to reset all

(4:37:25) it touch the um pins with your finger together it'll um make it go

(4:37:32) faster you know what I'm saying like short short it out with your finger

(4:37:39) basically like the um the power button and things like that like all the all the little metal pins put your finger to

(4:37:45) it and it'll discharge like all the little tiny capacitors in there how much voltage you just hold on

(4:37:52) to I mean it can hold on to it for a while but a very small amount

(4:38:12) okay putting it back in oh

(4:38:22) boy are there any debug codes no there was a debug code I would debug on the code

(4:38:46) is there different rails that you can use off of the uh PSU I don't think so I don't

(4:38:54) know I mean like is there another um oh my God hold on the light is green now instead of blue okay we're going to turn

(4:39:01) it on nope it turn blue the blue light

(4:39:06) doesn't mean anything does it what is the blue light from as rock

(4:39:13) 299 Tai Chi blue vers oh wait blue light

(4:39:44) [Music]

(4:39:52) [Music] that has to be a ground or a short

(4:39:57) problem don't know if that's true if I unplug my two eight pins the board will like stay on for a little bit I guess it

(4:40:04) it feels philosophically it feels like a grounding or shorting problem but

(4:40:10) a is the case header in the correct spot I think there's only one place I can

(4:40:15) plug in this header because the case header is a it's

(4:40:20) like a front panel wait oh no wait no no shot no no yeah yeah I

(4:40:28) think there's only one place on this motherboard that this will plug into and it's down

(4:40:34) there right right yeah

(4:40:42) oh my god did these just break oh no they move okay

(4:41:08) whatever unplug the case fans

(4:41:25) okay

(4:41:32) [Music]

(4:41:42) all right can you I want you to check something out for me um oh wait is something different

(4:41:48) happening okay I did that and it didn't fix it but this this fan in the middle now is spinning and it wasn't

(4:41:55) before I don't think it was cuz I just heard a sound from it that I hadn't heard before so this fan must not have been hey you see by the C battery

(4:42:02) there's two LEDs bios a and bios B there's two LEDs there should be two

(4:42:07) LEDs um closer like if you look at the battery the thing closest to the edge

(4:42:12) there should be two LEDs there no bios A1 bios B1 what do you

(4:42:20) mean when you say LEDs what do you what do you mean like like it's like world's tiniest LEDs oh um I don't know there

(4:42:27) might be but literally nothing on this board is is turning on for more than like half a second or

(4:42:33) whatever um I'm going to I'll send this to your phone

(4:42:48) do either of those turn on or do you see either of

(4:43:01) those [Music] um hold on

(4:43:13) oh I don't think any of them are coming on that's not

(4:43:35) good do you know if it's a XE model did you see XE or no oh if it

(4:43:43) matters who is that yeah it is Xi is that someone in your background yeah that's in my background

(4:43:48) oh okay hold

(4:44:04) on is the UPS doing the power drop it I should can try this I guess but

(4:44:18) please shut the [Music]

(4:44:24) up now other PSU to test with no not right now

(4:44:41) I'm reading something about someone that did something stupid to get this to work and it said it worked one out of 10

(4:44:46) times um do you see the seos reset switch yeah hold that in while you turn

(4:44:54) it

(4:45:02) on nope give it a few tries this guy said it worked like one out of 10 times

(4:45:14) [Music]

(4:45:25) [Music]

(4:45:36) nope okay well all right this

(4:45:42) I'll bring over my laptop it works

(4:45:49) what um I I'll just bring over the laptop I have it's a 10900k it's

(4:45:54) faster than that anys what how many capture cards does

(4:45:59) homeboy need I think I'm I just I just got another system you're just going to buy another computer sure why not

(4:46:07) it has to be a reason that thing is not turning on [Music]

(4:46:22) hold on corrupted bios can do that the emergency flash bios

(4:46:29) procedure hold

(4:46:36) on one second we're going to do one last thing here

(4:46:48) [Music]

(4:46:55) [Music]

(4:47:06) [Music] I don't know if you want to with this or not like cuz we don't know if

(4:47:11) it's a hardware issue or not but basically I'll send you the article

(4:47:16) um and click on the

(4:47:21) uh click on the very last FAQ the one that's like I'd like to install the TR4 even though it's nothing to do with what

(4:47:27) you're saying basically uh they're saying that if you have a corrupted bios on both A and B it can cause this issue

(4:47:35) but then you got to get a USB drive and you got to put it in the port and do the emergency bios Flash so if

(4:47:41) you want to do it the instructions are there I don't give a I'm going to eat dinner have a good one be careful

(4:47:47) yep

(4:48:27) I'm just going to take this out and I'll try um I'll try powering it on outside the

(4:48:35) case just in case

(4:48:42) do it cake said jump the 24 pin with a paper clip and see if the PSU Powers up at all I don't know what that I don't even know how to jump a thing with a

(4:48:48) paper clip I don't have a paper clip

(4:49:14) hello the is

(4:49:39) this this

(4:49:53) [Music]

(4:50:16) the am I am I still screwed up some it's just trolling

(4:50:22) me troll epic epic troll

(4:50:45) this cable will not come the

(4:50:58) [Applause]

(4:51:04) out Jesus

(4:51:11) you

(4:51:17) [Music]

(4:51:49) okay power supply is here everything is plugged in as it

(4:51:56) should be there's literally no way to know if

(4:52:02) this is the correct PSU cable though huh I don't I don't think I swapped anything I'm

(4:52:08) pretty sure I kept everything separate I'm like 90 9% sure I kept everything

(4:52:21) [Music] separate you should be able to set this on the ground on like vinyl flooring and

(4:52:28) then that wouldn't short it right I don't think can I try powering this on just like on the floor

(4:52:36) [Music]

(4:53:13) don't you think it would short off the screws on the floor I don't think that the vinyl flooring is a big conductor of electricity

(4:53:21) okay okay but who knows maybe I'm wrong maybe vinyl is actually an amazing conductor of power who

(4:53:27) knows maybe I'm super wrong on

(4:53:34) that but you know what I don't care I want it to break

(4:53:45) there's really no power button on this motherboard

(4:53:51) [Music]

(4:54:07) seriously okay two eight pins are connected the 24 pin is

(4:54:13) connected um where's the stupid

(4:54:20) header nope

(4:54:26) [Music]

(4:54:44) this is Frankenstein

(4:55:18) exact same

(4:55:26) problem I have no

(4:55:32) idea it's the ram 100% I don't I can't even um

(4:55:51) like I can't even get to the one of these RAM sticks like I could only literally res you know what it let's just take one ram out why not

(4:55:58) let's see if that changes anything why the not bros

(4:56:16) nope same

(4:56:24) [Applause]

(4:56:29) problem let's unplug the fan maybe it's this fan maybe that's what was causing the problem the whole time

(4:56:35) [Music]

(4:56:51) just

(4:57:25) nope I have these kind of problems I strip it down to Bare Bon CPU Ram mobile PSU and start yeah it's as Bare Bones as

(4:57:30) it can possibly be out cake it's literally the I have the CPU one stick of ram the front panel header and then

(4:57:38) both eight pin things plugged in plus the 24 pin the funny thing is if I remove like let's try with one a

(4:57:46) pin let's see what happens nope and then let's remove this eight

(4:57:52) pin and then turn it on when I remove both 8 pins the motherboard will stay on

(4:57:59) like now I'm getting in like the ram just lit up if I have no CPU power to the board I don't know if you can see it

(4:58:05) but like so I don't know what it could possibly be

(4:58:14) so like right now the CPU power is not there so I don't

(4:58:23) know oh now it just turned off oh now it's turning back on don't

(4:58:28) know why die

(4:58:48) unplug the front thing and then short it with the screwdriver I

(4:58:55) don't even know if that would I don't I don't know which two pins to short I guess I can try to look

(4:59:00) Jesus front panel

(4:59:05) connector it's not labeled is it like the two bottom left

(4:59:16) ones I don't even know have the screwdriver we'll short

(4:59:29) them HT plus power

(4:59:34) button minus so it's the top and the top

(4:59:40) it's the top two on the

(4:59:46) right I believe

(5:00:29) plug in

(5:00:36) it wouldn't immediately power down without like um let a graphics card inserted right that would

(5:00:41) never be the default behavior of a motherboard right to power down like that instead of like shooting an error

(5:01:08) code okay oh okay so theoretically if I touch my screwdriver to these two

(5:01:13) things it will turn

(5:01:23) on oh cute I tried to but same error as

(5:01:31) before or do I have to hold it there

(5:01:56) nope

(5:02:15) nope this you know what this computer has served us well okay this is

(5:02:23) technically this is my old streaming PC I think we bought this in like 2017 so you know he's been a proud warrior for a

(5:02:29) long

(5:02:36) time again it turns on if I don't have the eight pins like it won't shut off immediately but

(5:02:58) [Applause]

(5:03:12) is there really a micr center nearby that's open are you 100% sure that cable is

(5:03:17) from the PSU I'm like 99.9% sure it's from the P like I don't think I realistically would have ever swapped

(5:03:24) these oh my hand

(5:03:48) no yeah yeah yeah wait do I have a mic on yeah I do yeah like the other PSU that I have the

(5:03:58) um wait a

(5:04:04) second wait I still have this PSU why did I swap psus

(5:04:13) oh because I didn't have the I didn't have the cabling I

(5:04:19) needed you know I could try this we could just I could just try this I don't know how I was missing these cables you

(5:04:26) know what this let's just Frankenstein some crazy together and see what the happens what's the worst thing that could happen everything

(5:04:32) breaks this already anyway this already gone in the dumpster you know what let's just let's just

(5:04:37) do it it's all SE Sonic at the end of the day right it it  it

(5:04:47) boys oh a it's your old friend

(5:04:53) hello your old friend is here to provide some

(5:05:08) energy look see this the cable is still connected to this PC so there's no way that I mixed the cables up it's

(5:05:15) impossible

(5:05:21) okay let's let's let's do some

(5:05:30) frankensteining

(5:05:36) um as a half meme if if you ever want to swap cables on psus what you should look

(5:05:41) up is the PIN guide to see if that it's using the same pins some cables you can swap some you can't um I'm not doing

(5:05:48) that because I don't give a and I'm throwing all the away anyway so you know what you know what bro I don't

(5:05:54) care I don't care I don't give a  I don't care I don't care cuz I

(5:06:01) hate this it won't even come

(5:06:08) out hello hello why is there so

(5:06:26) AIDS there okay

(5:06:43) okay what is where that other Ram stick go did I bring it with

(5:06:49) me don't know don't care don't know don't

(5:06:56) care this guy oh

(5:07:02) yes let's go this is degenerate Behavior

(5:07:12) oh oh yes my my finest creation ah yes

(5:07:47) put the old Ram back in whenever you're in troubleshooting stuff you always want to have as many variables as possible

(5:07:53) for things that could go wrong

(5:08:00) [Music]

(5:08:16) more variables means more chances for Success

(5:08:29) true it's the same I don't even know I don't know what am I I don't know what I'm looking at like I'm pretending like

(5:08:35) I'm going to see some into the  Matrix

(5:08:48) all right what is the worst case that could happen here it would start smoking and

(5:08:54) then what I just unplug it

(5:09:01) right good luck good luck brave warriors let's stick let's stick a fan

(5:09:08) on it okay let's we don't want to be too crazy here we don't want to be too out there all

(5:09:25) right okay all right let's go big guy everybody is cheering everybody's

(5:09:32) cheering for you actually you stay over there all right

(5:09:50) wait what it's the exact same

(5:09:56) problem huh so it's either the the

(5:10:02) motherboard uh the mother I mean it would have to be the motherboard that first stick of Ram or the CPU I guess

(5:10:17) [Music]

(5:10:22) it's the other Ram I mean like well here let's okay hold on let's

(5:10:30) eliminate this guy

(5:10:39) [Music]

(5:10:46) okay thank you alternate PSU you served me [Applause]

(5:10:52) well a dead seos battery can cause this exact Behavior I don't even know I don't know what that even means bro oh

(5:11:00) the seos

(5:11:16) if I check the

(5:11:23) um I'm wasting so much time like I would be better served if I would just ordered new parts by now

(5:11:44) can the computer turn on without a simos battery at all like if it's connected to power does that matter like will it work

(5:11:50) or

(5:11:56) no yes it can

(5:12:36) Jesus whatever

(5:12:42) wait what is that nope what did I even do oh I just I took

(5:12:49) out the seos like if I hit the seos button on the back I don't know if you can see it

(5:12:54) like it'll it'll turn on and turn off

(5:13:02) immediately there's no chance that it needs a GPU to turn on right

(5:13:14) oh I should not with this while it's powered on

(5:13:49) what the is this ladies

(5:13:57) [Applause] gentlemen young lady just fed me French

(5:14:05) vanilla ice cream we all got our toes out too get

(5:14:59) okay is this in why does it seem so  fimy

(5:15:17) yeah Frankenstein go turn on

(5:15:43) wait hello same problem this is

(5:15:51) okay it's

(5:15:57) the is this button [Music]

(5:16:10) bios Flash oh that's for flashing the

(5:16:16) BIOS it's just I'm just wasting my

(5:16:25) time I'm just wasting my time that's all I'm

(5:16:31) doing you know what the real issue is it just needs to go in a different

(5:16:37) slot that was the that's that's the issue it needed to be in this slot and that would fix

(5:16:44) everything it's this there oh yeah that's that's it that's

(5:16:50) the problem that's the

(5:16:55) issue oh no it's not the issue really didn't do

(5:17:03) all oh crazy I thought that would have for sure been the issue

(5:17:15) wait wait wait wait wait maybe maybe it needs to be in the maybe it need to be in the bottom slot maybe that's it oh my

(5:17:21) God this is the wait no no no wait the third slot this is

(5:17:28) it it's this one oh this is the magical slot I can feel it it's this one

(5:17:45) oh it wasn't that that wasn't the problem either

(5:18:26) many

(5:18:44) how late is the Micro Center near me open if I would have theoretically drive there to buy a new

(5:18:53) computer 900 p.m. what is it right now 740

(5:19:08) I

(5:19:23) never I don't think poorly seated Ram would even cause the issues we're  having but

(5:19:52) my whe saying Destiny nice

(5:19:59) okay okay we re to the ram good luck this is the one Oh wait

(5:20:17) this is it actually wait I don't want to RIS  this Graphics C up cuz I still

(5:20:22) want to use this so okay all right AIT the barest of bare

(5:20:29) bones two sticks of ram I could have just one a CPU with no heat

(5:20:36) sink motherboard power  and we don't even need that fan

(5:20:41) plugged in actually wait sometimes they do want the fan plugged in to start I think I feel like that's a

(5:20:48) thing it will overheat instantly um usually they take around 10 seconds to

(5:20:53) overheat or at least they used to okay the bearest of bare

(5:21:03) bones good luck

(5:21:13) wait the am I blind

(5:21:25) nope rip my my beautiful my beautiful PC this is our

(5:21:33) streaming break for like seven or eight years guys

(5:21:38) it's been a long time but it's time to let him go it's time to let

(5:21:44) this just reat it how can a CPU become unseated you literally push the rods

(5:21:49) down to make it go in and it's the heat sink was on there's no possible way that the CPU became unseated that's just not

(5:21:56) possible

(5:22:14) this has been sitting off for a while right look for any cap pass mother that are bulged up bulgy wges is that what

(5:22:19) I'm looking for you want me to look for some you want me to look for some bulges some bulgy wges oo

(5:22:45) I'm so triggered I just wasted so much time on this computer today not sure if you're allowed to

(5:22:52) disclose how much money we making from the computer building business back when you did it was it an extra 100K a year I don't even know if I made that much

(5:22:57) total I charged 15% the cost of parts to build the system and I probably did around it was like 100 to 200 I don't

(5:23:03) remember how it did um but if I did we'll say we did 150 with an average cost of we we'll round up and say 2,000

(5:23:10) a piece so that would have been $200 for we'll say 150 PCS would have

(5:23:15) been $30,000 right

(5:23:54) this powerful don't drop that this poor

(5:24:01) baby he worked so hard for so long

(5:24:11) our battle hard and Warrior Fs in chat there is a little Mark on this

(5:24:16) but I don't know if it's like something I just did or by dropping it or if something was already broken a

(5:24:23) little make it into a necklace what is this [Music]

(5:24:29) um I don't know I go wash it

(5:24:35) off oh Jesus I can't s like that for a long

(5:25:05) okay this was a 798 80xe

(5:25:47) are there any bent pins why wouldn't it work um I don't know my guess is I must have damaged something in the case

(5:25:53) transfer although I don't know what could have possibly been damaged um it's

(5:25:59) I mean like this I used this for like eight years and then I let it sit basically for 6 months unplugged since I built my new rig upstairs I don't know

(5:26:06) if like that could ever cause an issue to happen but um yeah I don't

(5:26:23) know I remember you having problems getting this PC to work when you built it I mean maybe but I mean like it worked well

(5:26:28) for a long time

(5:26:38) like running hard too right because I streamed on this for a long long long time hold on now that I've given it good

(5:26:45) water washing maybe now it'll work there we go yeah

(5:27:24) okay I'm just kidding I don't care you break the pins this computer

(5:27:30) everything I wasted enough time on this today I'm sorry I shouldn't have done that oh I feel bad for him I'm so

(5:27:36) sorry I feel like I disrespected him he deserved a better send

(5:27:48) off my friend I'm sorry feels bad man

(5:28:18) do I want to drive wait would Microcenter be closed for Halloween is that like a federal

(5:28:24) national holiday or some

(5:28:36) [Music]

(5:29:04) [Music]

(5:29:14) I don't even know which of these screws I need anymore God I'm so triggered right now

(5:29:26) okay what do I need I need everything no I don't it's mobo Ram CPU mobile Ram CPU

(5:29:34) mobile Ram CPU is that it heat sink mobile CPU heat

(5:29:40) sink I have the case the GPU the PSU and the

(5:29:47) storage Ram heat sink new PSU No it should work boot drive I have a drive in

(5:30:07) [Music]

(5:30:13) don't risk the PSU it have the same problems with both PSU this PSU is brand new I just had this power supply in my

(5:30:18) in my studio computer but I swapped out from the studio computer a th000 watt one cuz I put a 490 in it so this PSU

(5:30:24) works and in this PSU probably works and it had the exact same problem with both both psus so I think it's um it was just

(5:30:32) it was either the board or the CPU

(5:30:37) [Music] the PS2 is killing everything

(5:30:44) Bast I need a motherboard a CPU I need a motherboard a CPU RAM and a

(5:30:52) heat sink that's what I need I just need to go do it I just need to go do it how miserable
