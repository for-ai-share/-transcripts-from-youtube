(0:00) they tie all that back to you right as the Yeah as the head honcho the the head
(0:05) organizer how did you keep your ass out of jail from all that i get that question a lot and uh I know it makes me
(0:11) look like a fed like I I'll make it worse i never had any problem traveling whatsoever canada uh I'm banned from
(0:18) Australia but I never tried i bet I could just breeze into Australia maybe because I'm They know I could raise money i raised a quarter million to sue
(0:25) the SPLC which is sitting on some judge's lap somewhere so maybe they know I'm latigious maybe they know that
(0:31) because I'm a public figure I would make a big brewhaha out of it whereas someone like Nick Oaks you could just throw them
(0:36) in jail and few people will find out about it um but what what crime have I
(0:43) committed i begged people not to go to Unite the Right i said "You're out of the club if you go." And then post being
(0:50) the the found the leader uh I said "Don't go to Jan 6 it's a trap please
(0:56) you're going to get I said you're going to get shot and then you're going to get arrested but uh I was close ashley got
(1:02) shot um but yeah I've just been constantly I I love this club and I've
(1:09) been constant I've spent probably a hundred grand trying to keep them out of jail and you know get the true story out
(1:18) there because it's not a war on Proud Boys that's happening right now it's a war on men it's a war on masculinity
(1:25) it's a war on independence you know fit young men wanting to improve themselves
(1:31) and congregate is a crime in America right well that's really what I'm fighting this is pointed out often is
(1:38) that what I think happened was I think that
(1:43) it was tangential that uh these these guys were getting into fights with these Antifa scumbags who by the way have
(1:49) dissipated where I don't even know where the they are now they just kind of lurk the internet and look to mass
(1:54) report people and this type of thing right they're not even up to the same antics that they were even a couple of
(2:00) years ago i think that's tangential though i think that that was something they could point to to say "Oh these
(2:05) Nazis are out here beating up poor old ladies." But I think you hit it on the head when you said that you were trying
(2:11) to move something towards masculinity what I've seen is there is um a pack
(2:18) called Progressive Freedom and you'll see all these leftists are all part of this pack okay and they have bought up
(2:26) all of Twitch politics YouTube politics they've bought up all of the players they bought up Destiny and they've
(2:32) bought up all of his minions and all these different people okay this pack has bought them all what they have said
(2:39) and what you know our intel teams have told us is that they look at these red
(2:44) pill content creators and you know what that is the red pill stuff that's all basically um distinction between uh male
(2:52) and female dynamics and patriarchy and masculinity and this type of thing and
(2:57) they say that red pill right and young men moving towards it leads to what's
(3:03) called a black pill or some kind of political nihilism where they're like wait we're not even allowed to be
(3:08) And that leads to the alt-right to the dissonant right and so they these packs
(3:13) these think tanks they figured it this out they're like "Wait a second if men
(3:18) move towards masculinity and they move towards it being okay to be men and self-improvement and this type of thing
(3:24) they're going to find out this world's reallyed up and it's pretty uh it's pretty against them." And so then they
(3:30) move over to these alt-right dissonant right groups right and then that's considered bad because that will lead to
(3:35) the fourth Reich and we'll have World War II right which is insane it's such a
(3:41) bizarre hypothesis hi this is Anthony Kumia hello I'm Gavin McKinnus and
(3:46) together we're compound censored and we would like you to subscribe with
(3:52) this deal using this promo code right below me right now
(3:59) do it cuz it's very entertaining i mean you might as well say it's just
(4:05) as logical to say then they get so far right they become mass rapists right or something and so we're doing this to
(4:12) prevent rape in the long run like out of all the the myriad of possibilities as someone goes more right to choose uh
(4:20) citizen army that eventually takes over the country's army and then starts a
(4:26) world war but if you're healthy if you're healthy and you're masculine and
(4:32) you you start young 19 20 years old he's really taking good care of yourself and you're focusing on the self-improvement
(4:37) model like that the red pill is giving or that maybe a guy like you um you're saying "Yeah go work out have a family
(4:44) work hard don't be a don't be a leftist," you know this kind of thing move towards masculine patriarchal
(4:50) values you can see how that would be really dangerous for leftists that's like from from a leftist
(4:56) perspective that's terrifying because you're not controllable you're not a victim group you're not a victim there's
(5:01) also a very shallow angle where it just makes them feel bad like when you tell Taylor Loren you call it an empty egg
(5:07) carton you show her a picture of you and the kids camping it makes her feel like a loser cuz she is she lost yeah you
(5:14) lost at the game of life and I think there's a combination there that it's dangerous so we have to quell it but
(5:20) also it hurts my feelings so that creates spite and I want revenge and I
(5:25) want to destroy his family well I think I think kind of um if you take that
(5:30) bird's eye view if you're looking out I don't think I think the left has very few skilled coordinators but they do
(5:37) have skilled coordinators oh yeah and they don't have the greatest think tanks but the ones they have are very
(5:43) influential and when these guys get together and they start diving through all of this and they start kind of
(5:49) mincing it up they realize that any group which is promasculinity and any group which is pro men's rights and
(5:56) men's rights advocacy they're dangerous to them because if if you can't keep men under control or you have
(6:04) them moving that way women are conformists and if that's what they see
(6:09) that the men want that they want submissive virgin women right they will
(6:15) begin to conform to that and the left is done the left is done if that happens
(6:20) when you have a porn star on Only Fans and you have Destiny getting you know his wife's so that they get
(6:26) divorced you've got this fractured minions and I think that we have a problem with with fracturing where where
(6:33) there's so much infighting that the the left has the I've said this a million times the left has a unity problem the
(6:41) other way where they're inviting in groomers and trans and and pedophiles and they're saying "Well we can forgive you you're just a minor attracted
(6:47) person." We have the opposite problem where Charlie Kirk hates Ben Shapiro hates Nick Fuentes hates hates Laura
(6:53) Logan like I love if you want less government and strong borders you're my friend i don't care if you're a Zionist
(6:59) an anti Zionist i appreciate Charlie Kirk and Nick Fuentes and Candace those internal fracturings that you're talking
(7:06) about I'm This is just me i think that it's women in right-wing politics that cause
(7:13) 99% of the problem inside of right-wing politics i think it's women if you look
(7:18) at the sex capades from these if you look at the crazy that these women are up to in the background uh
(7:25) behind right-wing politics and and they're in charge of these different media companies they're a
(7:31) problem and they're the ones who are the more way more likely to do the blacklisting they're the ones who are
(7:36) more likely to uh create this type of infighting generally speaking when I talk to right-wing creators whether it's
(7:42) behind the scenes in front of people whatever they're not a problem like hey man you want to go have a beer yeah sure
(7:49) let's go have a beer let's talk about A B C and D but when you start looking at anytime there's a crumbling relationship
(7:55) anytime there's something going on in the backdrop seems like there's a  woman back there now you got to
(8:00) get women prominent women out of right-wing politics it's really bad for us there's very a lot of them
(8:06) are too they complain about me too and then they're flirting especially when they're drunk but then there's ones like
(8:12) Savannah Hernandez you know her super hot Mexican Asian chick infowars gal i
(8:18) think she's at Turning Point actually now but uh she just when you're with her she gives off this like don't flirt with
(8:25) me like I'm not a chick I'm a dude i'm here to get the job done she's she was raised by a tough Mexican dad and she
(8:32) has this real like let's get to work kind of vibe sure and there no headache there's going to be no drama she belongs
(8:38) here but generally politics is is basically it's a guy's game it's a
(8:44) numbers game it's a lot like baseball it's stats uh if we had 2 million illegals in America right now I wouldn't
(8:50) give a but we have 30 yeah and that's too many when Muslims are under 10% of the population things aren't that
(8:58) bad over 10% we start seeing trouble these are all numbers the deficit is numbers the capital gains tax uh
(9:06) interest rates that's what powers jobs and that's what matters in politics and chicks you know testosterone is a
(9:13) concentration drug chicks don't tend to to thrive at mathematics so get out of
(9:18) the get out of the our room well they don't tend to thrive with criticism they don't tend to thrive with policym they
(9:25) don't tend to thrive when it comes to controversy they tend to capitulate on almost everything in order
(9:32) to be in with the in crowd whatever the in crowd is they don't want the criticism like cops always tell horrible
(9:38) jokes to each other cuz they need that dark humor cuz they just saw a dead kid so we're at a hotel room we're sharing
(9:44) in the hotel room and we're on some we would travel all all the time courting like Red Bull and all these different
(9:49) companies and very handsome uh fit young man and we'd be in the bathroom brushing my teeth and and he'd be he'd have his
(9:55) shirt off and he'd be like "Look at okay look at this look at these golden locks look at this chiseled body." Okay it's
(10:03) like you're looking at an ad you're looking at a Greek god i I would argue possibly the most perfect male ever in
(10:09) the world right now look at this look at the eyes look at the chin that
(10:16) doesn't exist look at the fat neck look at the weird Grover arms with the fat belly and I would be laughing my head
(10:23) off because his insults were so cruel and accurate can you imagine two women
(10:28) on a business trip where the girl is like "Look at my golden locks look at my perfect tits." Yeah now look at this now
(10:36) look at you fat as your tits are hanging off you like penises you've got
(10:41) jowls you got beady little eyes your hair is disgusting it's all fried
(10:48) or even a black woman imagine it was a white woman and a black woman your fake  hair you're all ashy like she
(10:56) they'd both be in jail oh yeah it would be terrible but that's what but this is my point is that this is what I see
(11:01) honestly in right-wing politics whether it's dissident politics or it's the kind
(11:07) of more middle of the road mainstream TPUSA all of this every time there's
(11:13) women involved even even this this last one look at what happened uh Candace Owen right she moves out she
(11:21) moves out of this now there's a big controversy this and that now I like Candace Owen I actually like her and
(11:26) think that she's better a cut above of most of these women who are in still a  woman chick there's a reason
(11:31) they weren't alone on pirate ships yeah still a woman and problems so I'm just saying everywhere I look seems
(11:38) like and when you look at all of the big right-wing sex scandals which have hap which are non-scandals look at what
(11:45) happened to Elijah Schaefer he was me too you look at all these different people they're always me too he was meed
(11:51) by who sydney Watson right-wing creator right and another chick and another chick i'm so glad but it's not natural
(11:58) like I'm so glad there's no hot chicks in the studio ever because it's going to pop into your head the Christmas party
(12:05) you're drunk it's going to occur to you and when you keep like flipping a a coin
(12:11) it's going to get to heads at some point well look at what happened bill O'Reilly taken down by a woman yeah right all
(12:17) these different people all these different right-wing uh voices sooner or later true or untrue and most of the
(12:24) time it's not even true when you find out years later like a slap on the ass or something yeah it's nothing but but I want to say something that
(12:30) sounds feminist cuz we're both drifting into anti-feminism here and I I am an anti-feminite but uh that's a word I
(12:38) made up do you like it i don't I don't That's like menism it doesn't you know what I mean menanism it just doesn't
(12:46) sound that great well the way anti-semites can no matter what the problem is they somehow bring it back to the Jew and I take every problem and I
(12:53) bring it back to women like I heard uh that Planet Fitness is quadrupling down
(12:58) on this train in their changing rooms thing and they lost $4 million and I I
(13:03) just I know a woman is involved in that decision oh for sure cuz they guard the nest and the nest is their woke values
(13:09) and they're like "Fuck you you my eggs are here." And they're like "Okay but your company's dying." Yeah the
(13:14) Mulaney thing woman you you the Mulaney that was a woman made that
(13:19) decision but but in women's defense this is not women in general i'm saying you took her out of her natural habitat and
(13:27) then you put her into this like Yay milo just fired a woman from Yay's company
(13:32) cuz she said to the fan sites Yay's fan sites does any have does anyone have any
(13:38) ideas for what Yay should do next and it's like that's a perfect example of women in the workforce i have no idea
(13:44) what's going on i have no ideas do you guys have any ideas yeah I have an idea go nurture children go create life and
(13:52) shape life you don't belong here it's like we might as well be bitching about gorillas as bartenders you know they're
(13:59) always breaking things they lose their temper they don't speak English and they're always like their big arms are
(14:05) getting in the way and they're getting beer all over their coats their fur uh I love gorillas but they don't they're not
(14:12) good bartenders women are wonderful in their environment and there's there's the Savannah Hernandezes there are
(14:17) exceptions but 95% of women are not happy in the workforce that's what I was trying to say on Fox News with But the
(14:24) exception proves the rule or there wouldn't be a rule right you couldn't have an exception if it didn't prove the
(14:29) rule so it's like look this is a good rule of thumb it seems like if the right really wants to move towards masculinity
(14:35) if that's the embrace that they're after because it's and it seems to be really effective as far as um you know
(14:42) campaigning goes and as far as a message goes they're going to have to start cleaning out the women i agree
(14:49) but and the thing about our message too is like with Proud Boys the the the fear is it'll start World War II no the
(14:55) message I keep pushing on my show and and with Proud Boys and in general is put a ring on it you've been partying
(15:01) way too long you're 28 years old she's gonna be 30 soon you're not gonna be able to have five kids get a ring on it
(15:08) get married grow up yeah and that's not World War II that's the opposite that's
(15:13) the backbone of American society right and the reason it works is cuz people
(15:18) try it and they go "Holy what would what took me so long what was I waiting for?" Similarly all these 40-year-old
(15:25) journalists the empty egg cartons are like "I was wrong i thought I could just be a colostomy bag for other strangers
(15:32) at 3:00 a.m and uh I'm miserable and alone and and nobody wants me and
(15:38) nobody want We're talking about that woman lose their looks and when it's a mom and the husband still adores her and
(15:44) the kids don't even can't even tell but if you're out there on the market in New York City and you're 38
(15:52) you might get a call at 4:00 when he's in a blackout but he's going to be gone at 10:00 mhm and you probably won't see
(15:58) him until he's that desperate again yep sorry ladies that's everywhere that's not just New York you talk to these
(16:05) different women from these different dating shows and it's pretty incredible right and it doesn't matter what their
(16:11) age are we're talking to them at 40 50 right all the way down to you know 18 19
(16:16) 20 uh and the whole market's just from top to bottom because the one thing they have of value they just give it
(16:22) away like candy right they just like here have as much of it as you want and so you know the thing which is so
(16:29) valuable your chastity your virginity the thing that gives you such virtue in the eyes of men you just hand it away
(16:36) for nothing you know and it's like this massive gold bar that only you have and you're just like here you go i said that
(16:42) to my daughter too i I use that same analogy i said "You have a change purse with gold coins in it that's called your
(16:48) chastity it's very very valuable but when you spend those coins they're gone." Yeah so everyone wants them
(16:56) they're valuable but you hold on to them cuz that's the the goal that's the change that you have but how is that if
(17:02) that's part of a message of masculinity and I think it is how in the could that be bad for society i'm telling you
(17:09) it's based on this real hypothesis that we're going to end up with the fourth
(17:14) Reich in World War II yeah how could you put I mean what is the fourth i'm making
(17:19) pancakes shaped like dogs cuz it's pancake morning what does the fourth Reich look like sundresses and virginity
(17:26) i don't like I don't get it what is it what is the fourth so dumb i I heard Michael Val was interviewing Jared
(17:32) Taylor about it and Jared Taylor's English is his second language he grew up in Japan and uh he said what we're
(17:38) saying but his his English is too literal and he goes you know the idea that these men are going to go get
(17:45) together and start World War II it's a new group of Nazis I mean the whole notion is just fantastic
(17:52) and by fantastic he meant like fantasmagoric like ridiculous silly
(17:57) Disneyland made up stuff and Malice is like yeah I would choose a different word than that fantastic and awesome
(18:04) like 9/11 was technically Awesome it was awe inspiring and horrific but
(18:12) don't say it was awesome not to be conflated with greatest thing ever that's not what I meant yeah dope
(18:20) that's pretty funny but yeah I just think um I I think ultimately the reason
(18:25) that all these like Red Pill podcasts the reason all these manosphere podcasts do so well is because the creators are
(18:32) basically trying to push this me message of masculinity and you notice that most of the audience are right-wingers right
(18:38) many of them don't give a about politics they're not there for that but there's a lot of them the ones who do they seem to be on kind of the the right
(18:44) hand side and they're looking for marriage material women they're looking for what you know what sorts of uh
(18:51) pitfall traps can I avoid what sort of red flags can I get away from it's fascinating to watch that's why people
(18:56) enjoy watching it so much well it has rewards like the It's so weird we pushed
(19:01) this no wanks thing that was like no fap don't watch porn don't beat off you can match within a yard of your significant
(19:08) other with her awake and paying attention that's but no like watching methheads who got by their uncle on a
(19:15) computer screen alone with your pants around your ankles and we ended up as Proud Boys we ended up there as a fluke
(19:21) it was just a dare like a Seinfeld episode and then I was like I'm whistling in the shower i'm smarter uh
(19:28) my relationship with my wife is way better so then we started saying to people just try it try it for 10 days
(19:33) and the left was against that like the Daily Show did a whole thing on how dangerous it is not to watch yeah
(19:42) isn't that depraved well it's not just depraved but the Here's what I've noticed with the left with all
(19:48) progressives they don't want expanded rights for things that you might think
(19:53) we would need rights for like speech guns they only want to expand rights when it comes to degeneracy
(20:00) they only want expansion of degenerate and so anytime you
(20:05) do a curtail if you do something reasonable you're like you know if you're in a state like Texas a place
(20:12) like this maybe they roll out legislation where they say "Hey look guys guess what they did in Florida
(20:18) right we were just talking about it when we were there if you're 10 11 12 now you have to verify before you go on a porn
(20:24) website so that we can make sure you're not a Is that okay is that Can you give us that bone but then when it
(20:29) goes to court right they keep getting them thrown out the left leftists keep getting them thrown out saying "Nope
(20:35) this against speech going to curtail this going to curtail that." You know what I mean they get it thrown out every chance they get yeah well New York
(20:41) courts just threw out familial DNA cuz the ACLU said it's an invasion of privacy and we caught a serial killer
(20:48) like a year ago who was murdering little girls and now we're like "No that's an
(20:54) invasion of privacy." Well how do these guys How do these guys make the justification everybody needs to get a
(21:00) vac cuz it's good for everybody if everybody is faxed collectively right
(21:06) whether you like it or not you go "Okay well that's fair how about uh everybody has a mandatory paternity test too when
(21:12) a baby's born that way we make sure there's no fraternity fraud since we have that technology now and have never had it before i can't believe you'd want
(21:19) to invade people's I can't believe that you'd want to tell women how about you have to be a citizen to vote how about
(21:26) you have to have ID to vote no that's an invasion of their privacy that's that's that's too that's too much invasion now
(21:34) now give me your arm so we can stab you and the scary thing about that about this this movement to to legitimize
(21:41) degeneracy is they they started with mar gay marriage and I fell for that i was like "Yeah let them get married they're trying to be normal." Then I found out
(21:47) they were lying they have a 95% divorce rate they they they don't they're not monogamous at all like you
(21:55) you just lied to me but anyway almost all of their marriages are non- monogamy almost all so you don't have kids you're
(22:01) not monogamous what's left yeah you're a genetic dead end how do they rep the pitch the pitch was like "My lesbian
(22:07) lover was dying on her deathbed and I wasn't allowed to see her because we're not family and and I'm sitting there
(22:13) going "Oh that's mean uh let her see her her dying lover." And no they switcheroo
(22:20) but now they're pushing and I think there's actual
(22:25) want to be normalized and we see them linked to drag queen story hour we see a lot of this way but then there's a lot
(22:31) of people who are just and they don't really want to kids they
(22:36) just know it makes me mad and they're like "Yeah hey Mega i brought my daughter to Drag Queen Story Hour that's
(22:43) your worst nightmare isn't it?" And I'm like "Well yeah it's also my worst nightmare for you to walk her across the
(22:48) highway uh during rush hour." Yeah uh is that to spite me yeah you're a sick
(22:53) yeah i don't like you abusing your child congrats you got me well the other thing the insanity is I think one of the
(22:59) reasons that these event organizers and the think tanks who are pushing the
(23:05) LGBTQ agenda and have been have to move a little bit towards the sexual
(23:10) orientation is because they they pigeon hole themselves we're born this way we
(23:16) can't help our sexuality you go okay so you can't help what you're sexually attracted to no well okay what about
(23:25) these P then oh well uh and and that's
(23:30) that's where the argument falls apart but I remember reading that uh and by the way if you see something on 60
(23:36) Minutes just say I remember reading it makes you sound smarter yeah so I remember reading not seeing it on 60
(23:42) Minutes that uh when a woman has three daughters and a son the son is almost
(23:49) always gay because the bo her body is like "Oh I'm making a woman i'm making a woman i'm making a woman and then a boy
(23:56) starts forming and the body goes "What the fuck?" Uh there's some there's a parasite in here something weird is growing that I don't understand so then
(24:02) they shoot estrogen at it to fix this woman problem my woman's broken and then he has a chick baby yeah total total
(24:09) junk science that's it total junk science same thing with There is no discernable reason we don't understand
(24:16) there is no gay genes there's no gay part of the brain none of that exists none of it's ever been able to be
(24:22) discerned by any type of of conclusive scientific data not even good junk
(24:27) science data we cannot figure this phenomenon out however now we have
(24:33) something that we never had before which is we have a new generation where when we have the most acceptance ever one in
(24:39) four identifies as being some kind of LGBTQ which would indicate that this could easily be a social contagion
(24:45) rather than something which is innate sure true but they're phonies and they don't suck like all of these some of
(24:52) them do suck all these like zoomers who say I'm gay they then they're a lesbian
(24:58) and then they're a chick and they just have long hair and you're like you're in a you're in a a heavy metal band basically you're not gay that's
(25:04) true and Margaret Show says this she goes "If you think gay is something that can be learned go suck a That's true and
(25:10) I agree with you that it could the social contagion could all be pop culture." Absolutely yeah it's all It's
(25:16) like being a mod or a goth or a cowboy the gay population's always stayed pretty stable like 1.5 to 2% okay of
(25:24) actual practicing homosexual men for the first time ever it's actually projected to go higher i understand and
(25:31) that's a ridiculous trend that's not No I I mean I mean actual homosexuals who
(25:36) are practicing sexual acts no they're not sucking no no not not people listen
(25:41) what I'm saying okay not talking about people who just identify that way that's what you're saying you're saying "Okay
(25:46) the one in four number that's true but they're laring they're laring they're pretending that they're gay cuz
(25:52) they want to be in with the cool clip blah blah blah blah blah." Actual homosexuals the amount of them which
(25:57) exist inside of North America is about 2% actual gay men but for the first time
(26:03) ever that number which is they are  men is projected to go up and it
(26:08) has stayed stable for I'm dubious of that study i'm dubious of of the data they were getting in the 60s and 70s uh
(26:16) with the stigma of homosexuality still being so strong back then I'm I'm dubious of the 80s stats with the stigma
(26:22) of AIDS hanging out uh I think it's always going to be 1.5% i don't believe
(26:29) that people can outside of horrific trauma I don't believe people can just
(26:34) suck on a I think that so what we found with programs like MK Ultra Okay okay
(26:41) and this is so this is all CIA testing things like this all these things have been declassified now so that we can
(26:47) research them the influence on male sexuality and female sexuality utilizing
(26:52) psychedelics it was proven that utilizing various methodologies for brain probing and propaganda that you
(27:00) could influence male sexuality there's no doubt that that's true so were MK Ultraing a whole bunch of zoomers well
(27:07) I'm saying that through through propaganda there's a phenomenon called sis sissyhypnification i don't know if
(27:13) you've ever ever heard of that hypno i think we call itificication yeah most mo a lot well not most but a lot of
(27:20) transgenders who get into the social contagion are actually people who are suffering from autogophilia so what they
(27:26) are is they're men who when they wear women's clothing they get off on it okay when they start diving into that they
(27:31) find what is called uh you know hypno which is h they they watch videos
(27:38) which hypnotize them right tell you things like suck wear women's clothes blah blah blah blah blah you'll find
(27:45) these all over YouTube yeah I agree with you and I and I well I don't agree that you're not uh born that way but I I do
(27:50) agree that it's a problem now that kids are getting involved and I I just we were so good with the gay thing for so
(27:57) long from basically zero to Liberace Paul Lynn Ripped uh the guy
(28:05) with the mustache who threw the confetti YMCA Judas Priest it was all like "Okay I don't want to know what you guys are
(28:11) up to but go ahead and dance around and maybe even we'll dance to some of your songs." And then they opened the door to
(28:18) the kids and now we care the Pandora's box well you can't put the the
(28:24) toothpaste back in the tube that's the problem and the thing is is that that was a mistake it was a mistake for the
(28:30) conservative right who have what are they trying to conserve they're trying to conserve Christian values and in some
(28:36) cases constitutional values right it's a huge mistake for these people to embrace these absolute degenerates and
(28:43) pretend that because they said "Well I just want to get married so that when when Lindsay dies I can will her my
(28:50) Subaru." Right that's it was a trick that was a total trick right and it's like that was a huge
(28:56) mistake and so now I see the same trend playing out again oh there's the good transgenders the conservative ones like
(29:03) Blair White like blah blah blah like Lady Ma it's the same trap and
(29:08) yet we're falling for it again well we're also falling for it with abortion and Coulter's a good friend but she says
(29:16) uh the right keeps losing to these stupid voters who are obsessed
(29:21) with abortion so she goes "The only way we're going to win is if we compromise." And this kind of goes back to what we
(29:27) were talking about earlier we assume that there's some goodwill and you want to discuss this with me but they don't
(29:34) want to compromise so if the right says "All right you know what 8 weeks you can have an abortion anywhere in America as
(29:40) long as you have it within 8 weeks." They won't do it they they don't they won't go "Okay we met in the middle
(29:45) let's agree to disagree." You know what they want nine and a half months like
(29:50) they want you're already born off with the head so giving them a bone giving
(29:56) them an inch is not going to work they want over and go ask them they want over
(30:01) 9 months and that's what it is in Canada it's nine months that's what it is here in New York it's nine months nine
(30:07) months dude well you can't compromise with godless heathen
(30:12) secularists you can't compromise with them because what it's just like with gun rights right we have the whole cake
(30:19) and they come in and they take a piece what what do we get we didn't get anything when they took a piece we just
(30:25) had less cake and then they take another piece bump stocks little another one of
(30:30) the gun and all that and so now we have this little tiny piece of cake left and they're like "Let's compromise that
(30:36) just means we're going to take more of that shit." Right that's all that means we And they don't want to hear what an AR-15 is they don't know what it is and
(30:43) they they they're not open to discussing it they just want to keep chipping away at it they want they you can't
(30:49) compromise with the godless secularist it can't be done and anytime they come to you in the guise of I just want to
(30:56) find some common ground they're lying what common ground can you find with a secularist we went "Okay let's
(31:02) just call this gay marriage thing not marriage but we'll give them all the same benefits of marriage right we're
(31:10) just not going to call it that because that would be bad for society to do right we have this thing super important
(31:16) to people and we want to keep it sacred you know and it's religious anyway there's really no reason for us to you
(31:22) know we'll call it a civil union exact same thing get the exact same everything." No no a priest who's a
(31:29) woman needs to marry me yeah and bake me a cake and you can't And bake me a cake you can't compromise these people
(31:35) they're insane yeah well I like Austin Peterson for the gun thing he was I hope I have his name right libertarian
(31:40) Austin Peterson yeah yeah i talked to him quite a bit he's like "Fuck bump stocks and all that i want to fight for
(31:45) the right for me to have a machine gun in Manhattan." Like go on the offense don't go on the defense and you know we
(31:53) saw this with in Israel i forget what it was 2006 or something they said "All right th these Jewish homes are are
(31:59) wrong uh they're in the West Bank we order the Jewish families out and you
(32:05) and then we'll bulldoze the homes." Yeah and what did Hamas do to that they saw weakness and then they attacked the next
(32:12) day and it started a whole siege because they saw blood in the water and that's the way we have to deal with the left
(32:18) there's no drag queen story hour under any circumstances and no we're not doing eight weeks abortion is illegal
(32:25) period everywhere and I get a gun no matter where I am in Manhattan or
(32:31) Alabama i get my handgun it's my property it's my right and I have the
(32:37) First Amendment on any platform in any form you can't stifle me in any way and when you do those compromises you start
(32:44) tripping away the people on the right they lose their they lose their morale and they don't want to go vote but when
(32:51) you play hard ball like that that gets the voters in the Midwest off the count yeah and not only that they don't care
(32:57) so much even then if you lose right okay you know what yeah maybe I lost but I
(33:03) went for it you know what I mean and we're going to go for it again people can get behind that that's an
(33:08) objective mission that they love especially men men love that all or nothing high stakes let's go
(33:14) let's do it but this compromising you don't need to comp and you don't even need to compromise with
(33:19) them we tried it and it doesn't work doesn't work doesn't work it's And politics are polarized always going to
(33:25) be polarized it's my team your team so it's got to be my team yeah that's the way I am i'm I'm so
(33:33) divided no no I'm not divided i'm so uh what's the word um polarized where I
(33:39) love everyone on the right and I don't ever get involved in any punching right uh outside of a couple jokes but uh with
(33:46) the left if you have they them in your pronouns I we're not I'm not even looking at you you're a ghost you're
(33:51) scum you don't exist and I'm not talking i'm I'm I've tried bridging the gap and that they just they they you
(33:58) give them inch they take a mile so it we We're not friends you're trying to ruin this country i'm trying to save
(34:04) this country you're going to be extinct in a generation anyway so bye-bye well
(34:09) they would try to take they try to take your family away anyway they try to take everything they could away from you and
(34:15) it's a nonreroductive ideology all we have to do is essentially is survive as long as
(34:21) possible because uh and survive with power i mean not not live we'll be able to live but we need power one of the
(34:28) best ways to do that is to reproduce that's how you you create crossgenerational power they have a
(34:34) dying ideology that's why they need to indoctrinate your kids because they're not going to have they came after my
(34:40) kids like they attacked my home they ostracized my children my daughter had to go to a different school uh you know
(34:46) my son was eating lunch alone it was it was and my wife had a nervous breakdown like they attacked her personally and in
(34:53) the boar war with the English that worked they they burned down the houses they killed the wives and the children
(34:59) and the men broke but the English tried it in the American Revolution and it had
(35:04) the opposite effect made them want to fight harder you you want a war you got it and I think that's that's
(35:11) definitely where I am but that's where a lot of these younger new right guys are where they're like "Good I want to fight
(35:17) bring it on." Yeah bring it on you  pieces of well look this was a a great conversation i appreciate
