Title: Jazmen Jafar Vs Andrew Wilson Debate Gets HEATED

(0:00) is right or like some variant of that some variant of it I I have more of a

(0:05) like one-size fitall doesn't really work for a relationship so I'm more about

(0:10) individual Choice cool well we'll explore anyway what's up guys we are live so we have a really epic debate for

(0:16) you we got Andrew Wilson a Christian conservative Jasmine Jafar who I would say what would you characterize yourself

(0:22) like only liberal that for sure cool awesome so this is going to be a really

(0:27) [ __ ] epic crossover the topic at hand is is patriarchy good or bad for

(0:32) relationships and uh we're going to get into it we'll probably do an open Panel afterwards if you have any questions for any one of the guests where you just

(0:38) want to speak your mind uh just wait wait and we will get you on later anyway also just as a heads up uh both of the

(0:44) people everyone here is mildly sick and my voice is kind of [ __ ] up too I don't know why so uh but yeah anyway I think it's gonna be a good time so

(0:51) Jasmine really quickly I don't think my audience is too familiar with you can you give an introduction about yourself just say who you are and what you do

(0:57) yeah so my name is Jasmine Jafar I am an only fans Creator um I'm also a licensed

(1:02) attorney so kind of had an unconventional career shift um I still do both but only fans is my full-time

(1:09) job now okay interesting and then Andrew most of my Chad knows who you are but just G give a quick intro anyway my name

(1:16) is Andrew Wilson host of The Crucible uh fastest growing debate Channel online to

(1:21) my knowledge uh I do not have an only fans because nobody would ever want to see that um and I don't blame them so

(1:29) yourself Andre no no only fans for me unfortunately I guess okay cool uh all

(1:36) right so anyway so here's the format uh Jasmine you're new to my channel so uh basically the way it works is I'm GNA give you guys both a chance to make your

(1:43) opening statement Andrew since you initiated this I think you should make your opening statement first and then we'll have Jasmine go it'll be we'll

(1:49) keep it two three four minutes you know I'm not going to be uh Nazi when it comes to the time but something like two or three minutes opening statements then

(1:55) going to get into the open Panel version so you guys are can go at it uh since we only have one topic today I'll let this

(2:01) kind of Weir into any direction that it wants to but if it gets too too off topic like we start talking about like [ __ ] abortion or something like that

(2:07) they'll probably bring it back uh generally I will not be talking unless uh either the uh topic either we get way

(2:13) too off track or uh one person is not able to talk due to the unreasonable amount of interruptions otherwise you

(2:19) guys will not hear from me much it'll just be Andrew and Jasmine uh just go and at it okay Andrew let's kick it off

(2:25) with your opening statement okay um thanks for humoring me guys I'm I'm under the weather I picked something up

(2:31) at a wedding I was at over the weekend so bear with me as I get through this I wrote my thoughts down on this to make

(2:37) it as easy for my opponent to disagree as she can if we are discussing any

(2:42) aspect of the always nebulously defined an Ever elusively evil patriarchy which

(2:49) has been oppressing and being mean to this strong and independent women of the world since history began I think it's

(2:56) important for us to outline a few Universal truths the first truth as I have often argued is that absent

(3:03) enforcement Society fails to function Force being the ultimate Arbiter of dispute and will always be and will

(3:11) without fail as a society and this is any society they'll always appeal to it

(3:17) one of the necessities of reality is that force is necessary to inforce which is why it's written in the word in force

(3:24) itself men will always descriptively speaking have a monopoly on Force this

(3:30) is an unavoidable consequence of descriptive reality women will always have to appeal to men for their rights

(3:37) as they are absent the quality of force this is true both at the micro level and

(3:43) the macro level force will be used at both levels to enforce the will of women and that will always come from men this

(3:50) Imus men with a greater responsibility to society than is present for women as

(3:56) for the perpetuation of humanity it's necessary for men to provide some sustainable condition for both women and

(4:03) men to thrive with such privilege comes the almost necessary condition that

(4:10) homes should be run in compliance with this descriptive reality as the responsibility for the security of the

(4:15) woman is ultimately going to be in the hands of a man for any ultimate

(4:22) redress be that securing women's rights through Warfare a justice system or even

(4:27) a revolution not to mention just allow them to sustain via infrastructure that responsibility is his alone because he's

(4:34) the only person who can do those things she can't there will always be some exceptional women who can also do

(4:42) something like this but they are an insignificant minority to the point where in many Industries they might as

(4:48) well not even exist in them at all but even the exception will ultimately have to appeal to men to enforce their will

(4:56) uh as they also cannot do so they never could and they never can egalitarianism

(5:02) is a lie it's always been a lie and ultimately because this Security even inside the home is going to fall onto a

(5:08) man should such circumstances in society arise uh they should always be in charge

(5:13) of the household and make decisions for the household as the ultimate societal ramifications will almost always fall on

(5:20) him to repair the ability to use Force to enforce and I'm almost done thanks for bearing with me the ability to use

(5:26) Force to enforce will puts us in a different category than women altogether

(5:31) not better at least not morally better but nonetheless very different in what can be accomplished either in a Solo

(5:39) aspect or as a collective women cannot resist men with Force even at the micro level and so will always once again uh

(5:48) they they will appeal to men to do it for them they have to why they have a

(5:53) say so in the matters of either politics or the way a household is run outside of male permission is actually baffling to

(6:00) me I don't even really understand it seems incoherent uh and with that um I'll I'll

(6:06) pass the floor over before we get into Jasmine I just want to point out one thing Andrew got sick at the wedding so

(6:11) moral the stories clearly don't get married obviously okay all right Jasmine you're all right I'm also severely under

(6:17) the weather so if you've seen me in the past super fast and like energetic you definitely won't be seeing that today um

(6:23) I get like clogged up even from talking too long I also did not write out um an opening statement or anything but my

(6:29) general position on this is that relationships there is not one siiz fits-all so the premise of is it healthy

(6:35) or is it unhealthy I think that's dependent on the relationship and the Dynamics of a relationship and the boundaries of a relationship have to do

(6:42) with the two people in the relationship we are billions of people in this world we all come from different cultures we have different values we have different

(6:48) personalities and so having this one siiz fits-all doesn't really work I also think that um there's a reason that in

(6:55) more advanced countries like this um United States that we we are seeing less stringent gender roles and I think

(7:01) that's a reflection of our times I don't think the force argument of men would need to enforce rights is is a strong

(7:08) one I think by that metric kids don't have rights the elderly doesn't have rights uh we set up our system in know

(7:15) the way we did for a reason we have three branches of government congress makes laws uh the executive branch

(7:21) executes them and the uh Supreme Court uh legislates them or I mean evaluates

(7:27) them and I would say like if any women on the Supreme Court by your metric

(7:32) would have to have a uh they would have more of the responsibility like you're

(7:38) saying because they have more of a voice in in society so I think these like post-apocalyptic like if all the men

(7:44) turned against all the women like you know it's it just it's not a reflection of reality that all the men are going to

(7:49) turn against all the women and we're going to live in like Ken's Mojo Dojo Casa house like I just don't think

(7:55) that's reflective of our current society and oh my God I'm so

(8:00) sorry um so uh sorry lost my train of thought

(8:06) but um get this up too um so I mean yeah

(8:13) that's basically it I don't and I and I think that there there's a reason that in so many relationships that we're

(8:18) seeing things are more equal and it's not one person has more power or authority over the other Jasmine just to

(8:25) really quickly uh summarize your position so uh if someone asked you is patriarchy good or bad for relationships

(8:31) will you generally be leaning towards bad or good I think it depends I think there are certain people that lean more

(8:37) traditional like there are a lot of women and I think that's a great if you are a woman and you want to have be in a

(8:43) traditional relationship you want the man to lead you I think that's great you can go on I I believe people can be

(8:48) happy with different values and with different Lifestyles I also think there are certain women I would put myself in

(8:53) this category who aren't happy in those kind of relationships and I think there's a reason that a lot of women are

(8:58) gearing away from that and moving to choosing to be in relationships that are more equal there are also a lot of men

(9:03) who don't want to lead and don't want that traditional relationship either so I'm I am a big proponent of finding

(9:09) someone that aligns with your values and I think that people with different values can go off and be happy in their

(9:14) own right I don't think I think trying to pretend that everyone is one way and that one way works for everyone is a

(9:20) really new as a really juvenile way to look at things because the world is obviously far more nuanced than that it's not that black and white okay fair

(9:27) enough all right let's get into the open Panel so have it guys yeah so let let me start with um the Crux of one of your uh

(9:34) false positions here you said that if men were the rights givers the elderly wouldn't have rights or kids wouldn't

(9:41) have rights but that doesn't actually make sense why wouldn't the elderly have rights or kids have rights men are the rights givers well my point is that if

(9:48) you're just going off who has rights based off who can enforce them who has the Brute Force then any time where

(9:53) somebody doesn't have the Brute Force so you could even say Christians and I my parents are immigrants from Iran

(10:00) Christians in the Middle East don't have rights because they can't enforce them because there's far more yeah that makes my point though not your point that

(10:06) makes my point not your point so if ultimately you're saying that enforcement is done and it's going to be

(10:12) done in even these nations that you are talking about where Christians are oppressed let's say that's being done by

(10:18) men it can't be done by women it can't it's an impossibility for it to be done by women because they don't have the

(10:24) capacity to utilize Force collectively to make men do what they want so if you bring up the Eld

(10:29) and you bring up kids having rights for instance they can have rights because men give them rights but men can

(10:34) collectively take those rights away and you say that that's not it doesn't make sense or it's not reflective of reality

(10:40) and then instantly you point to places where it makes sense and is reflective of reality right this second so this

(10:45) makes no sense to me I wouldn't you argue that Christians like have rights though or wouldn't you argue children

(10:51) have rights nobody has any rights rights are completely fictitious and made up unless you can give me a justification

(10:57) for a right can you give me a ification for where Right comes from rights are just a reflection of moral intuitions

(11:02) that most people have especially if you're talking about Universal basic rights like the right to live I think most people agree that five-year-olds

(11:08) shouldn't be killed just because they can't enforce their rights yeah we could all or men could all so then they're not

(11:13) real because intuitions can change I and you could say that and now we're getting into a question of moral philosophy so I

(11:19) don't think that just because it's a super complex question where do rights come from right super complex it's not super complex it's super easy the

(11:25) justification is where does rights come can I finish my point so I'm saying that just because there's a complex question

(11:30) like if I was to say the meaning of life is having nice things and you were to say no I don't think what that is and I'm like well what is the meaning of

(11:36) life and you were like well and if you don't have an answer to it that doesn't mean that my position is because that would be a fallacious argument I haven't

(11:44) she just finished I didn't make a fallacious argument I made an actual argument that was not facius and I'm

(11:51) asking you again you say I believe that there's rights and what rights are are intuitions moral intuitions which are

(11:57) extended out to people I ask you those intuitions can change right and you say yes well then it

(12:04) sounds like rights are fictitious they don't exist morality right and as an

(12:09) atheist you're you're I'm um from your intro you seem not to be I I I'm not here to argue about objective morality

(12:16) or an objective set of Rights right I think a lot of those are based on our moral intuitions and as a society as

(12:21) we've evolve I don't think we malfunctioned evolutionarily in 2023 in societies where we're not we're not

(12:29) under threat of war or poverty right as we go higher up the maso's hierarchy of needs we have our basic needs food

(12:35) shelter Etc we're seeing that we're not at war with our neighboring Villages and no no guy needs to know how to use does

(12:40) that have to do with rights like let's back up because you're you're you're moving way far away from the goal here

(12:46) I'm asking you specifically women's rights in your estimation are not real

(12:53) is that right yes or no I If by that then no rights are real yeah right exact

(12:58) exactly so no rights are real so how does that prove your is that true or false I'm just trying to get clarification I guess if you get down to

(13:05) the Crux of it are there rights that are independent of human uh uh moral

(13:10) intuitions no but I don't know how what it has to do with boys versus girls in this world like to me this is just I

(13:16) didn't ask you if they're independent of human intuition I'm asking you if rights

(13:21) are an objective fact and objective reality or not rights are an objective reality because of basic moral intuition

(13:29) that most people the vast majority of men and women agree with now yes that would not be an objective reality that

(13:35) would not be a descriptive for something which is objectively real a tree a tree is objectively real rights are

(13:41) conceptualized You're conceptualizing Something based on another conception of how people feel about a thing right but

(13:47) I'm say so I'm agreeing with you but that means that there's either no rights or that there are rights that are based on moral inition how this is a male

(13:54) versus I'm asking you to just make the clarification yes that there's no rights then there are no rights in the same way

(14:01) that there is a tree you're right okay so there's no rights so since there's no rights if you were going to ex explain

(14:07) to somebody that they had a right for instance you have the right that women have to like be equal with men right

(14:15) where does a child what makes that what makes that true what makes it true that

(14:20) absent force that that's actually true our institutions that we've created

(14:26) right and more advanced countries the ones that respect human rights are not the ones that are really enforcing it

(14:32) those use Force those all all those institutions you just said they all use Force every single one of them uses

(14:38) Force every one but any woman in Congress or the Supreme Court has more power than you ever have right no they

(14:44) don't they only have the power ofr me every three seconds am I crazy like can I finish okay but I just feel like this

(14:51) is a very like it's almost cute to me because like your ideology has no power in media you have no power in the

(14:57) corporate world you have no power in education Academia you hardly even have power on social media platforms which I

(15:02) don't agree with I don't think you should be deplatformed but up until this year I mean even Youtube CEO was a woman

(15:08) she could have unilaterally taken away your right to even be on YouTube what does that have to do with anything if the descriptive reality is just to say

(15:15) hey things aren't favoring your worldview that's not a [ __ ] argument give me an argument if you wanted to for

(15:21) instance Grant the right to for for pre-born babies to have life how would you go about that do you go in the

(15:26) street enforcing it through brute force or do you have a system that you have to go through that doesn't involve Brute

(15:32) Force at all right so ultimately so this is my point right so I'm glad that we can get to the Crux of this how do we do

(15:39) this well we can look at the world as it exists currently so that we can look at the different modes of how this is done

(15:45) here in this country in fact there have been revolutions there have been uh Civil Wars there have been civil

(15:51) conflicts over these perceptions even though it's supposedly axiomatic that we

(15:57) have rights in this nation which we clearly don't if you look in other places in the world that's exactly true

(16:03) as well they don't have rights inherent because there are no such thing as inherent rights including women's rights

(16:09) they don't have any rights absent enforcement you point to institutional

(16:15) power like for instance the Supreme Court you say these women have more power no they don't they only have as

(16:20) much power as the enforcement arm of men allows them to have period and they'll never have anything external to that

(16:26) they can't it's impossible again I don't understand how this is like you you're you're like if these post-apocalyptic

(16:32) circumstances all AR postapocalyptic it is though because that's the thing right no I asked you if so all the countries

(16:38) right now where women have no rights or a postapocalypse because you keep interrupting me can you answer my question if you're just gonna talk the

(16:43) whole time my question to you is if right now you wanted to give rights to pre-born babies how would you go about

(16:50) doing that uh right now me personally I would use a legislative process however

(16:55) I would also Lobby for a collective of men and the and this is what I do now

(17:01) the more that you Lobby for that Collective of men ultimately you'll be able to be able to consolidate power

(17:06) based on the fact that Ultimate Force could be used if necessary this is why

(17:11) yeah and how's that going for you I'm just saying like this idea of oh I'm going to get these men to come in and

(17:17) say we're going to do this through Force I again that's not an argument don't you

(17:22) understand that you're not making arguments you can't say that Saudi Arabia is post-apocalyptic is it a

(17:29) post-apocalyptic Nation what happened hang on hang on no no no no stop let me finish let me finish you say these are

(17:36) only postapoc I mean the apocalypse is not coming to the United States these nations right now exist where women have

(17:42) no rights where was their apocalypse where did the meteor come down and destroy everything and it's Mad Max in

(17:48) the streets and there's there's oil cans I don't get that the Nations that use brute force to to to give people rights

(17:55) are the ones where it seems like people have the least stions like we you prefer

(18:01) that kind of thing if you're trying to get a group of men to collectively use Force to give people rights in the United States it's clearly not working

(18:06) for you your side it is you should move to Saudi Arabia I'll explain this I'll

(18:12) explain this if we if we control the institutions we control the force it's the same process don't you understand

(18:17) that wherever wherever the institution is that controls the power of men's

(18:23) Force right we will always win all the things that you're pointing at are just

(18:29) the power of collective men using force all the institutions the military law enforcement that's all a collection of

(18:35) men utilizing Force so if you're talking about institutions what we're really doing is we're seizing the collective

(18:41) power of using for yes it is true abs and force they have no power we're in 2023 as things evolve as psycholog as as

(18:48) Tech not psychological Tech as technological advances continue to come about it's not even even in war anymore

(18:53) it's not a battle it's not sheer numbers right there scientific Oppenheimer was the biggest film of the Year oh yeah

(19:00) yeah no you're so right there wasn't just this massive attack that happened with guys Sky skydiving in with old

(19:07) parachutes and machetes who just went into a first world nation that had an Iron Dome missile system were able to

(19:13) circumvent it and kill hundreds of people with their primitive

(19:19) technology I'll let you go right after this so real quick I want to give you guys heads up we're getting pretty off topic I'll leave you guys two or three

(19:24) more minutes to explore this further because you're having good discussion but then I'm going to bring it back to initial topic go ahead Jasmine okay I

(19:30) feel like this was his whole argument though um I don't even know it's part of

(19:35) let me try to let me try to bring it back so even if you want to say that as a collective whole that men if they

(19:42) decided to ter tomorrow all fight against all the women there's a battle of the sexes this is your this is your

(19:47) scenario St man I would still say that I don't know how um what you're looking at

(19:52) a relationship a relationship generally has two people sometimes it has more how come in this dynamic because men could

(19:59) collectively take away rights from all the women that a man should have the authority in the household because the question becomes

(20:05) then I don't think it's even in countries where in countries

(20:11) like the United States where we're not under as much of a threat as of of war and all that stuff and poverty and we

(20:17) don't have a stringent of gender roles women are choosing and men are choosing to not have the relationships be molded

(20:23) in this way why do you think that is do you think because I think I think that the institutional power right now favors

(20:30) progressives but it won't always be true and I also think that we will see policy even in my lifetime of one vote

(20:36) households and I think that patriarchy has always been inevitable because it's a descriptor for reality and feminism is

(20:43) not a descriptor for reality it pushes away from the descriptive reality which is patriarchy and the reason that you

(20:49) can't get away from this from this descriptive reality with feminism is because you always will have to rely on

(20:55) men's Force to secure whatever feminist agenda that you might have always there's no way to circumvent that so

(21:02) when I'm talking about how does this how does this move over to the micro level with individual relationships it's

(21:08) because I want to see as a prescription for society a single household unit if they vote fine okay but I don't think

(21:15) that everybody should vote that's one I definitely don't think women should ever vote that's two and I think that all

(21:22) votes even if your marriage should only be on a household basis and even then after it's with Public Service you claim

(21:28) that this is outside the realm of possibility but it's clearly not as long as institutional power and authority is

(21:33) achieved just like you Communists well maybe not you but just like Communists did uh 60 years ago we can do the exact

(21:40) same thing and Institute the policies that favor us in our worldview that's that's wonderful I don't know how like I

(21:47) I don't think that will happen each generation is getting progressively more Progressive and this I don't even know

(21:52) what this voting system that you have in mind that's not been seen here is is supposed to come to FR it has been seen

(21:58) do you think we're using the vo systeme go ahead that's fair I'm sick

(22:03) right now so I not go it's fine my point is that I don't I still don't get even if we had your system where it's one

(22:09) unit one vote how does that actually affect the in the inner dynamics of a relationship because women won't have

(22:16) rights authority over the woman just because you're do you want do you want them to to have that Authority by force

(22:23) in the relationship because you're s because he can overpower her physically is this the point no wait wait that's a

(22:29) straw man right yeah so I answer your question it's actually a straw man all he needs to have is enforcement he

(22:35) doesn't have to use Force right now for instance women favor force of men right if you're going to get a divorce for

(22:41) instance or something like that and the husband says no I don't want to [ __ ] divorce right he can't do anything about

(22:47) it because other men with a nice shiny hat a badge and a gun come hul his ass to jail right that's how it works that's

(22:53) enforcement so when you're talking about this even on an individual scale right at a micro scale yes each individual

(23:01) household should also be an instillment of the uh larger governmental body it

(23:06) should be a reflection of that and it should be patriarchal in nature because it's part of the descriptive reality of

(23:13) uh how the world works but you just said the descriptive reality of right now is that we have the institution so it's not

(23:20) a descriptive reality of the world right now like you just said in this dyamic people are going to come and pull them

(23:26) away those men are not all on like one team and then women are all on one team right so if you're talking about

(23:31) individual relationships why the [ __ ] should someone like me be like oh you know what I'm in a relationship with you

(23:38) and we have all the institutions we have all the power most men are on my side but me and you should still have this

(23:44) dynamic because in Andrew's hypothetical future why would we care what you why would we care what the people without

(23:49) rights say I don't get it why would we care with the people without right say why would we care so if you have no

(23:56) voting power you power why would we one of the foundational pillars of our

(24:01) country is freedom and the freedom to live your life it was not for women where did the freedom for women come in

(24:07) for the foundation of our country used to yeah if you go farther back in our evolutionary trajectory we also used to

(24:13) rape and kill and all that stuff and it was fine as our moral philosophies have also evolved our moral philosophy has

(24:20) not not Stag and my moral philosophy is winning so if my moral philosophy is

(24:25) winning I guess I could make the argument that relationship

(24:32) look what do you mean your moral philosophy is to win what do you mean by moral no I'm saying right now we have

(24:38) the power in the institutions we have the enforcement arm so by your standard if we have the enforcement arm then

(24:44) should relationships be because the way I see fit they already are because of the descriptive reality that men are

(24:51) enforcing the will of a bunch of stupid feminists don't know what the [ __ ] they're talking about and that can

(24:56) change easily and it has changed in the past not only has it changed in the past but you did not start out with the right

(25:03) to vote women didn't start out with the right to vote in this nation it was never an entailment that the Axiom that

(25:08) all men were created equal was supposed to apply to people who couldn't even enforce their own rights why in the

(25:14) world were our Founders ever want that they wanted nothing to do that that you are very dismayed about the state of our our our world right now but the question

(25:20) is is patriarchy unhealthy or healthy for relationships I'm not asking back in 1800s it's about today as as far as I'm

(25:28) concerned and my thing is oh yeah we can never look at history to find out about the heal there's not one type of

(25:33) relationship right now that I can sit here and say this is the way it should be we have all different kinds of

(25:39) relationship in this country we have polyamorous relationships that are becoming more and more common and those relationships people seem to show just

(25:45) as much if not more in some studies happiness than other relationships we want see Rel should be about people who

(25:51) want to be together enjoy their lives be happy be healthy not hurt other people

(25:56) why get why should they be about that why should I accept that this is axiomatically true that relationship

(26:03) should be about whatever feminist [ __ ] you want them to be about why should I accept that that's true why

(26:08) should I accept that it's about egalitarianism and fairness and awesomeness and open relationships and

(26:15) only fans why should I have any at all acceptance that that's the way things should be as an a claim why should they

(26:22) be that way um well you could if we're going to get into the ODS and all that but our country was founded on secular

(26:29) secularism and freedom those were two foundational pillars so you could take it up with the founding fathers who were

(26:34) of your gender they did not decide that we want to have our society fraed around

(26:39) your Christian value yes they did which is why it was you're lying through your teeth why do we have the establish why

(26:46) shall Congress shall make no law um what's I remember the exact which favors one religion over another religion

(26:52) that's not secularism it doesn't say one religion yes it does it read it okay I'm

(26:59) going to pull it up right now it says Congress shall make no law favoring an establishment of religion it's just

(27:04) saying can't favor one religion over another another it's just religion in general no it's just one over another we

(27:11) can't favor one religion over another does it say one over another I'm gonna pull this up somebody tell me does this

(27:17) because they should take away my law degree then because I do not remember it's saying one by the way by the way I

(27:22) actually think we're saying the same thing just with different language okay no I'm right Congress make no RW ex

(27:29) respecting an establishment of religion period there is nothing so they can't so they can't say this religion is better

(27:36) than this one right they can't say religion in establish religion in general it says of religion so then they

(27:42) can't say one religion's better than another religion right you can't say one religion should rule anything right so

(27:48) one religion can't be better than another religion it can't be better than atheism either right that's what I'm saying it's like you they there it's an

(27:55) Establishment Clause saying that they can't favor a single religion that's it yes and as we know now I can show you

(28:03) but I can show you where your logic here is flawed your logic is flawed because people right now if they're in

(28:09) government can't they make policy based on their religion their religious values

(28:14) um they can't for instance like we've seen a bunch of Supreme Court cases where they try to do things like let's

(28:20) say in school you're not even required to say the Pledge of Allegiance and [ __ ] in school anymore because you're not allowed to make a law like that you're

(28:26) not allowed to make a law forcing people to follow a particular my question specifically is

(28:34) can't your morals right now if you're in government be informed by your religion

(28:39) thus the way you're voting is informed by your religion absolutely but no let

(28:45) me finish ENT Bible say not well let me finish the Bible says not to kill and so

(28:52) also our laws are not to kill so those are Christian values I think those are like I said moral intuition that the

(28:58) most of us have and again again again again yours your values are not

(29:03) succeeding here they haven't succeeded for a long and you constantly think that things are going to turn good for you

(29:09) but they're not like I said we have power in media in the corporate world

(29:14) you don't even necessarily have a right to on YouTube that's not an argument don't you understand you're not making

(29:20) an argument you're just saying is patriarchy oh okay okay fine well then anywhere else on planet Earth where

(29:26) that's not the case that's not the case you see how that it's not an argument to just say but right now the establishment

(29:31) favors us that does nothing to get us closer to what ought be or how we move

(29:37) towards what for instance in Iran where my parents are from you couldn't have a like I you I can't be there I can't have

(29:43) this lifestyle I can't have the kind of relationship I want over there it's not allowed so over there I guess patriarchy

(29:49) has to be the default for relationships and they probably should follow it unless they want to you know have consequences what does this have to do

(29:55) with anything no that's it does because in the United States where we have freedom and our institutions aren't

(30:01) putting forth your values can you explain to me why in modern society right now where these values are not at

(30:07) the Forefront they don't have any power anywhere why should two random people on the street follow them so you ought to

(30:14) follow these values or move to make these values correct because you actually have an imperative a duty to

(30:21) make these values correct There's an actual categorical duty to do this and where are you getting that Duty this

(30:27) would come from my moral framework the thing that you don't have so the moral framework that you just got done telling

(30:32) me is my moral framework is winning that's what you said your moral framework is I did not say my the my

(30:38) moral framework is winning I just said my moral framework is winning well what is your moral framework why should we

(30:43) follow feminism why is it good why is it good that we follow egalitarianism and feminism and all this why is it a good

(30:50) thing to do that why because like I said it's the Natural Evolution and the

(30:55) natural direction that our society is going as gender roles are not needed as much anymore there's a reason we

(31:02) didn't human beings have been adapting to our circumstances all this time and even in the same time period you can see

(31:08) countries aren't people that aren't struggling people that aren't under the threat of War these countries that are

(31:14) more technologically advanced the skills a man even a man needs to strive in today's society are not brute force

(31:21) their intellect emotional intelligence the ability to communicate all of those things that are not gender specific are

(31:27) how you succeed in today's societ okay I'm gonna respond because you just used a fallacy just you just appealed to

(31:34) Nature literally now I can say nature no no no if I say it is the natural

(31:41) occurrence of X right that's not an appeal to Nature because it's a descriptor I asked you for why ought we

(31:47) do this and you said because it's natural that's literally the definition

(31:52) of an appeal to Nature fallacy that's what you just did so I'm going to ask you again and maybe this time you give me an answer without a fallacy can you

(31:59) tell me stop can you tell me why it is that we ought to adhere to feminism and

(32:05) we shouldn't do our damnedest to move through the system in order to repeal it okay let me tell you because the

(32:11) equality the political social and uh the political social and whatever equality of the genders right now is the best way

(32:17) for a society to flourish and the societies that are flourishing have more of these kinds of values obviously you

(32:24) want both when both people I know I I remember I was accidentally in your thing with Destiny and you think women

(32:29) should be out of the workforce and all that I disagree with that I think our society one of the reasons it is flourishing is because we have instead

(32:36) of eliminating half the minds in our society half of the people in our society those people are also able to

(32:42) contribute to society right we have a 21y old woman right now making rockets at Nasa why shouldn't she be able to do

(32:49) that that is better for our society to have her brain also making Rockets than to have no women in that at all so it is

(32:56) actually better for Society for the both both both the genders to have these kinds of Rights and I think that's also

(33:02) reflected in like I told you like I told so then any place so then any place

(33:07) everyone has to do what I so then any place then where patriarchy is instilled as long as the population is flourishing

(33:14) like for instance let's say they're able to reproduce themselves which our society can't I would say that's a huge

(33:20) Mark of flourishing shouldn't we default to that because your standard for how you morally run for how you morally run

(33:27) the society is just based on whether or not they're flourishing that's your moral standard to run a society is not

(33:33) by putting your moral as all of us following and yeah don't tell me what what you don't tell me that your

(33:38) morality uh tells you that you shouldn't follow my morality just tell me what your morality is you just got done

(33:44) saying to me I don't have an objective reality I don't have an objective morality me finish I'm almost done and

(33:50) then you can respond relax relax okay you just got done saying to me that the

(33:56) only objective standard you have for Morality if in this in this instance is that the society is flourishing our

(34:04) society our society literally cannot even reproduce itself and yet the patriarchal societies can that's clearly

(34:11) flourishing by your estimation so why shouldn't we go to that under your moral framework your moral framework sit there

(34:18) and you can hope and pray that those societies overtake ours but they're not they're clearly not so I again I'm sorry

(34:24) you're unhappy with the state of things here diety is not reproducing no I let you finish I let you finish this time

(34:31) I'm saying that just because like I said just because it's a very complex question you're asking about if unless

(34:36) you have an appeal to an authority which is also a fallacy an appeal to Authority which is your god about how morality

(34:43) should work if you don't have that it's a difficult question it's like what is the meaning of nice what is what is the

(34:48) meaning of life what is consciousness making up an answer because you don't know like God I don't want to get into a religious debate I'm willing to but I

(34:54) don't think that's the topic here does not make it a good answer just because you don't know when you make something up I could say well I got my morals from

(35:00) this unicorn book concept is just too complex for you to engage with it that's

(35:05) what you're saying to me the the the concept is just far too complex and there's just too many Dynamic moving

(35:11) parts for us to really get into what makes and why patriarchy is moral philosophy moral philosophy there's a

(35:18) reason for thousands of years we have had so many philosophers this has been

(35:24) written on to the point that none of us in our life time could read everything there is to read about moral philosophy

(35:30) you can't tell me your you can't tell me what your moral standards are without a thousands year old dialogue thousands of

(35:37) di looking at the thousand year old dialogue to get your morals you're looking at scripture from a thousand

(35:43) years so I completely agree what does it have to do with you so I'm asking I've already explained it because you decided

(35:49) to believe something based on insufficient evidence and again I don't want to get into the belief of God but because you decided that oh I don't have

(35:56) a think okay let me just adopt this book that that book doesn't have evidence for it being the objective standard of Truth

(36:02) you have an easy thing to go to so your debate tactic is just to tell other people I don't know right the god of the

(36:08) gaps AR I don't know is not a reason to believe in something right so I'm saying there are a lot of people a lot of

(36:15) atheists Sam Harris uh there's which part of the argument was the god of the Gap answer this question can we get in

(36:21) objective morality without God if you want to get into that we can get into that not even asking for that that's not

(36:27) a Smoking Gun here why won't you just listen to what I'm asking you right I know I think you just don't understand

(36:32) what I'm asking you and so you're kind of flailing just listen okay just listen to what I'm saying to you I just want to

(36:38) know why we should follow why we ought to follow this egalitarian mindset which

(36:45) has led to our society literally not being able to reproduce itself whereas

(36:51) the patriarchal societies which we can clearly see and you have conceded are patriarchal can do so I can we pull up

(36:58) like because I thought birth rates were kind of declining in all of countries whether they're and some of them are patriarchal as well I've seen I've from

(37:06) what I've seen yeah so so all quickly yes so birth rates are declining in every believe Western Country besides

(37:12) Israel which has where it's uh going up because of invitro fertilization but is it also uh not declining in any of the

(37:20) other countries no it's on it's on a much smaller Decline and many of them are going up and most of this

(37:27) most of this is due to the religious backing and the patriarchal systems which are in place which tell women stay

(37:33) home and take care of your family don't go work a job 60 hours a week because that's insan C can you check on this Alex about

(37:40) because so I I'm sure it's declining in all the Western countries but isn't it also declining in the majority or in a lot of other patriarchal countries it is

(37:47) in some like for example in Russia it's declining and Russia is definitely not a country deining at

(37:53) a deining like going up is like uh India um like uh patriarch cast system uh I

(38:02) think like you'll see it in Middle Eastern Nations uh Philippines and stuff like that you'll see Anri I think if I

(38:07) were to look this up for every country you can say it's declining in the west I could probably pick another one that's

(38:13) not patriarchal where it's not or or where it's also declining but I don't have that in not at the same not at the

(38:18) same rates let me explain to you just how bad this problem why is it declining at all over there I'm gonna tell you why

(38:24) I'm gonna answer your question okay take South Korea for instance after it became westernized and it brought in

(38:31) egalitarianism right it has the lowest birth rate to my knowledge of any place on planet Earth it's so bad that in 150

(38:38) years they not going to be a Korea it's not even reproducing itself it's under the one it's under the one it's like 0.

(38:45) n0 right we need to be at like 2.2 something in there at least 2.1 right

(38:51) and we're way under that threshold and we are nose diving and this has a lot to do with the fact that Kore care women

(38:57) are focusing on Career first they're focusing on all of these things first before they focus on family historically

(39:04) that's never happened and I think that the best way to deal with that issue so that we can have a human race because

(39:10) that sounds great to me would be for us to Institute some types of policies

(39:15) which once again favor the patriarchal system and I think that that's inevitable anyway okay so my my question

(39:21) here is that what do you think of all the data so so there is obviously conflicting ideas on whether we're even

(39:28) overpopulated whether the birth rate declining is even good or bad I'm not even going to get into that because I honestly haven't read too much into it

(39:34) but I have read a lot about the studies on happiness and having children and it actually seems to have a very bad effect

(39:40) on your happiness and your marital satisfaction when you have children so I guess nobody should have children I'm

(39:46) not saying nobody should have children but I'm just saying clearly the default of having children may not even be the best so let me ask you the let me ask

(39:52) you for an entailment here let's assume for a second hypothetically that 80% of women were miserable after

(40:00) they had children that was like the default 80% of them just became miserable you realize that if 80% of

(40:06) women checked out of reproduction there would be no more human race would you say that that's okay say that's fine I

(40:13) think that there's obviously for a long time there was a time where everyone said oh my God there's too many people and now there

(40:19) people little people I do believe in I don't like I said I don't think we

(40:24) evolutionarily malfunctioned in 201 23 and actually the upper ranks of society

(40:29) are the only ones the higher socioeconomic status educated women are actually the ones that are having more you haven't answered my question answer

(40:36) my question and I'll repeat the hypothetical to you let's say for a second in this hypothetical 80% of women

(40:43) who had children were totally miserable totally miserable as the side effect of

(40:48) having children would you say then that they shouldn't have children even though that would clearly end Humanity would

(40:55) you say that that's okay tell someone that they should have children to serve Humanity okay so then if Humanity goes

(41:01) extinct tomorrow you don't give a [ __ ] I don't it's not going to go extinct tomorrow because people are making personal choices about whether or not to

(41:07) have kids I and and if it did even if it did I would never force people to have children did you not listen to the

(41:13) entailment of your own hypothetical the hypothetical is to test your morality and the morality for you is that if the

(41:19) human race is gone tomorrow you don't give a [ __ ] my morality is not based on how to to keep the human race going on

(41:25) and on and on and on I care about the people here their wants their needs their desires like I said so Hedonism

(41:31) it's just Hedonism for you it's not about cross generation it's not about keeping the human race intacted it's not

(41:36) about keeping people on this planet it's just about pure [ __ ] Hedonism I

(41:41) support people doing what generally makes them happy as long as they don't harm other people now you're saying they're harming future Generations by

(41:48) not having kids now I am not going to force people or tell people that they should do something so that in future

(41:54) Generations that that that the race will continue to go on again good for you let

(41:59) it go extinct right so let it go extinct I look forward to it working because it's been failing for a really long time

(42:05) and Each Coming generation agrees with you less and less and less I know you're trying to get your band of men good for

(42:11) you again I'm not worried about it because all your hypotheticals are like each generation where do I want you to understand

(42:19) actually how stupid what you're saying is I just got done telling you and you agreed that all Western nations are on

(42:25) the decline for their own birth rate which means their reproduction they're not reproducing themselves and all those

(42:31) patriarchal Nations that you hate Are they are reprod it's all Western Nations

(42:36) name me one that isn't no no no I'm saying it's not all patriarchal Nations the patriarchal Nations for sure though

(42:42) are reproducing themselves at least enough ofing at all at least enough of

(42:47) them for sure though the Western nations are not and so you say I can't believe

(42:53) how incredibly ignorant a plan would be that you think that patriarchy will reintroduce itself into society by

(42:59) necessity after you get done arguing that we're below replacement rates in the west and can't even reproduce

(43:05) ourselves wouldn't it be a necessary entailment then that patriarchy is

(43:10) inevitable if it's inevitable I'm not seeing a sign of it coming back where where is it you're saying the birth

(43:16) rates are de I just told you the sign of it yeah you're saying the birth rates are declining you're saying that clearly

(43:21) this is failing you're saying clearly women getting all these rights sucks clearly relationship shouldn't like this

(43:26) so are you why are you the only person that sees this are you just the one not

(43:32) I will say that the message is ahead of its time right but the decline in the birth rates has been people have been

(43:37) sounding the alarm for a while it's just been ignored because Dumbass Dumbass feminist

(43:44) propaganda and dumbass feminists who say stupid [ __ ] like I don't care even if it

(43:49) made 80% of women unhappy I think the human race should go extinct so that my woman can be happy we need the women to

(43:55) Bey Happy who cares at the expense of everything else on planet Earth if 80% of women that were giving birth were

(44:02) dying but they so they were dying in childbirth but their kids were living on and that was the way to keep the world

(44:07) going would you force those women to have children the entailment there of Force if you say would I make laws that

(44:15) were um stationed for them to have massive incentives to do this and you

(44:21) consider that to be forced because there would have to be people around to enforce those laws then like what like

(44:27) what what like what incentives for which thing so I'm saying in this hypothetical

(44:32) because you have crazy hypotheticals 80% of women that are going to have let's say we had some disease whatever that 80% of women who gave birth were now

(44:39) dying in childbirth and so a lot of them didn't want to have kids because if they had kids they would die but their kids

(44:45) would be alive and they would continue to flourish in society you're saying that that's good for society to do that

(44:51) because we have to care about what's coming next yeah in that particular case that yeah that particular case you would

(44:56) have a higher duty to make sure uh because that hypothetical actually isn't realistic but even if I engage with it

(45:02) in a realistic way if I just say okay let's just grant it you still in that case would have a higher duty to keep

(45:08) the human race perpetuated even at the expense of women because now you have to deal with men and women so even under

(45:14) the prism even under the prism of Happiness where you say well wait a second all the women will be completely

(45:20) miserable then it's like yeah but if you're if this is all you have to go off of is that all the women will die the

(45:26) second that they give birth they're necessarily going to give birth to men which means your happiness index would still go up even under those metrics how

(45:33) the happiness index would go up because there's people and like more people is that what you're saying yeah because they wouldn't exist otherwise right men

(45:40) otherwise wait you didn't answer my question in this hypothetical how would you so would you then Force because you

(45:45) said you wouldn't Force use brute force to force these women to give birth you said you would give them inent well no if I'm engaging specifically in the

(45:52) absurdum of this hypothetical I would say then that yes you would have a duty to actually use force and that that

(45:57) would be justified what would you do I don't know make breeding facilities probably Force the women in there and

(46:04) then okay this is great yeah can you tell me why that would be immoral under your hypothetical that you just asked me

(46:11) which is hang on stop stop let me finish can you tell me why it would be immoral

(46:16) under the hypothetical you just posited for me for me to put women in breeding camps and breed them because my moral

(46:23) philosophy I have a I I believe in the no har tell me why tell me why it's immoral to immoral to imprison kidnap

(46:30) rape Force women to give birth so that future Generations can go on yeah that's

(46:36) just restating the question can you tell me why it would be immoral for you to do that told you because I don't think it's

(46:41) moral to that's just a restatement if you don't think it's moral canot harm other people you cannot harm living oh

(46:47) you cannot harm don't don't people have to be alive for them to be harmed yeah the women that you're forcing into the

(46:52) camp are if there's by this metric of logic I need you to understand that what you're doing is saying we're going to

(46:58) eradicate Humanity so there will never be more people to be happy because happiness is your metric here right

(47:04) which means you're actually creating more harm by not locking them in the Brea I would say the absence of future

(47:10) happiness of a future people is not as important as preventing suffering and harm to the people that are here by

(47:16) kidnapping them raping them and forcing them to have children and dying I agree with I'm sorry I just do I don't think

(47:21) that the happiness of hypothetical people in the future or even hypothetical in the future you're coming to existence I don't think that

(47:27) outweighs kidnapping raping foring women to have children why not why would it outweigh that if it created If it

(47:34) creates yeah yeah I know you put more weight but you haven't told me why you put more weight people that are actually

(47:39) conscious right now but you're not you're not listening those people then are like I you are the like this is

(47:46) hilarious like you're you're actually saying to me this here's what you're saying to me you're saying future

(47:51) generations and their happiness don't matter right what matters what matters is what's

(47:58) going on currently and if the actions that humans collectively take currently right now eradicate all of humanity

(48:05) which then assures that there will never be people to be joyful or be happy then

(48:10) one happiness can't be your biggest metric it's impossible because you want there to be the most amount of living

(48:16) people who were happy regardless of circumstance two can't be consequentialism so what the [ __ ] is it

(48:21) what is the justification that's what I'm telling you it's so for instance like when it comes to the environment it's a scale like if it's not going to

(48:28) but if it's not if it's like okay let's make policy decisions so that we can keep our planet for future Generations

(48:34) that are inevitably going to be here because people are reproducing I guess you're saying they're not but we are having children born every day but

(48:40) that's different than saying that somebody getting raped murdered all of this so that future Generations can

(48:46) flourish I don't see even by your moral philosophy where in the Bible you're

(48:52) just begging the question you're begging the question again you still have not answered you posited the hypothetical

(48:57) not me to me and said and said what would you and said what would you do I say I would do X you say that's

(49:03) completely immoral but you haven't Justified why I just told you why I just told you I believe I believe that we I

(49:11) believe is justification believe in God am I Justified I'm telling you the hard

(49:16) and all of morality is about our belief so you saying I believe you're like oh you can't do that there is no objective moral it's not epistemic justification

(49:23) just say I believe with my sky God so it's all my preference and your preference is to follow your book we're all just talking about our preferences

(49:29) here that's what we're doing and my my moral preferences tell me that it is wrong to harm kill and torture damn near

(49:38) current people 80% of women in modern society future people can live I don't

(49:45) think that's moral and you think it is based on your moral philosophy which actually I don't even think many Christian well if that's true then let

(49:52) me ask you a question right would you bind in torture 1,000 people right now

(49:59) if it would stop the Holocaust would you do that no you wouldn't you just let six

(50:04) million people die horri if you want to get into the trolley exercises here I'm asking I'm asking would you would you do

(50:12) it super off topic my my question would you torture hang on would you torture one person to do it to stop the

(50:18) Holocaust okay are we going into the trolley stuff answer my question I'm testing your logic would you torture

(50:23) just one person to do it no no why because I don't I'm not a

(50:30) utilitarian I'm I'm not I don't believe in utilitarian your epistemic foundation then for your morality if it's not

(50:36) consequences it's not Duty you aditt it you just said the same thing there isn't an objective one so is the is the debate

(50:43) about my personal do I have to be like you are either a utilitarian you are consequentialist you are religious are

(50:48) you asking something my personal yes it's your listen Lady Lady it's your

(50:54) worldview it's your world you tell me that they're not right because they're not objective and I'm saying I'm not

(51:00) saying I'm not even asking you for an objective metric your metric right now are actually contradicting themselves

(51:07) right so in this case you would have to say that you're like some kind of deontologist and you believe that so if

(51:13) I ask you ask you this question I'm gonna prove this hang on lady lady stop

(51:18) I'm gonna prove this to you do you think that it's the equivalent stealing one penny is the equivalent of stealing

(51:26) somebody's house no no why what do you mean why why why is one

(51:32) penny why is it not the equivalent of that okay this is the thing if you because you really want me to just give you a position the way you debate is

(51:39) honestly like you you find these questions that are really difficult to answer and if I can't give you so if that makes you feel better I'm a moral

(51:44) non-cognitivist that is my moral that is that is my foundation and what's a moral non-cognitivist you don't it's it means

(51:50) that I don't believe in objective morality I think everything is kind of based on our moral preferences that's basically what I told you okay believe

(51:58) so nothing's Moral Moral intuition is basically what I think most of us are going by including yourself you're also

(52:05) okay and that's subjective right not objective by your metric right it is subjective okay so then why should we listen to a [ __ ] word that you're

(52:11) saying if you're saying if you're saying if you're saying I have a subjective standard and I'm trying to apply this

(52:17) subjective standard and I think you should follow that subjective standard because my position isn't that I have a

(52:23) subjective standard my position is all of us have a subjective standard yeah that's worse follows then who can we even

(52:31) that's the thing yeah exactly who by your standard who the [ __ ] could we ever follow for you and your God that's not

(52:39) what our that's not what this country decided to do that's not what our founding fathers wanted so you maybe

(52:44) should get the [ __ ] out and go into one of these patriarchal societies where they your moral philos so the status quo

(52:51) the status quo is all that matter moral philosophy and as much as you want to have these hypotheticals like that's the thing it's like the least threatening

(52:58) thing ever obviously I want my values to preva Prevail in my society and if my biggest threat is Andrew The Crucible

(53:04) sitting here being like well if all the men fought all the women like it would just be I'm like great we're gonna win

(53:09) we're great no you don't need all you don't need all the men to fight all the women you just need to have the

(53:15) institutions where the enforcement arm of men are and then you win the game it's very simple and if you think that

(53:21) the right can't do that and haven't traditionally been able to do that you're smoking crack lady because they

(53:28) have they're doing it now not only are they doing it now but you see more of a political polarization for instance you

(53:34) saw what happened with Mulaney you see what's happening with various people across the nation hang on let me finish

(53:41) you got boycotts you got everything the right is beginning to mobilize yes and they did they didn't do it with they

(53:46) weren't able to do with Nike anything else but cheat beer is something that I guess conservatives love to consume and

(53:52) they col Haven collectivized if you want to boycott beer sure go for

(53:58) it I'm not threatened by that I don't think you're going to come and take my rights the thing is is like I need you

(54:05) to understand what you're saying you're saying to me that if we did come and we took all of your rights hang on I'm

(54:12) gonna finish and then you can finish I promise if we did come if the evil patriarchy did get the institutions and

(54:18) they did take your rights and they made you they forced you to be inside of a home where they randomly like walk in

(54:25) and said lady you're going to have ex amount of kids every single day you say

(54:31) to me that since everything is a subjective standard you can't even say that that's immoral do you realize what

(54:37) you have done what you have got done saying is that there's no standard other than our own intuition so if our

(54:42) intuition is that that's what you do you have no argument to tell me that that isn't what you should do I agree so

(54:48) that's why I'm like thank [ __ ] God that the lunatics like you that think you should be able to go in and murder and kill to to to keep I didn't say

(54:55) should are the minority I didn't say because you're also say you have your morality that's supposedly objective

(55:02) that you can't get enforced it seems like you can't get it enforced for [ __ ] is is what's gonna uh continue uh in the

(55:08) future so my question you have no bus you said you let me I'm sorry I'll let

(55:13) you finish and my question to you now is to get us back on topic in me all right

(55:18) I am a 28y old woman Highly Educated I'm pretty [ __ ] Rich from only fans why

(55:24) should I get into to a relationship and have a patriarchal underpinning to my

(55:29) relationship can you tell me why I should do that in United States in 2020 in fact I can prove it to you using your

(55:35) own logic why you should because if anybody comes to make you do that you

(55:41) have no argument whatsoever from a moral standpoint as to why they shouldn't

(55:46) that's why you should because you AAL my position is nobody has a moral

(55:54) argument because have that nobody has one nobody has one

(55:59) nobody has a single moral argument for why you shouldn't do that so if they do if the patriarchy does do it and they do

(56:06) make you do that you have nothing to say about that nothing I'm gonna turn it to you now can you tell me where where you

(56:12) get your morals why is that morally wrong tell me why quick Andrew Andrew before you answer the question uh in

(56:19) about four minutes to the one hour mark I am going to more aggressively bring it back to initial topic you guys are having good discussion so I'm going to

(56:24) let it go for another four minutes but then I am going to bring it back so go ahead okay so my question to you Andrew is two number one uh where why why do

(56:32) you think it's morally moral where do you get your moral philosophy and also how do you think that that should be

(56:37) infringed on to or or enforced on everyone else and then my second question is is that uh I'm I'm just

(56:43) going to be honest me and most of the women like me were not worried about somebody coming into our house I have like three guards before you even get to

(56:49) like three yeah who are all men so my question here is that why your female go do you have like aale

(56:55) threat of a home let me finish the threat of a home invasion where someone's going to come force me to breed is just not at the Forefront of my

(57:01) mind and so tell me a good reason a real reason that I should live by your

(57:06) standard on in my relationships and in my life in general and what you're predating your morality on because I love moral philosophy a what if you if

(57:14) you have done moral philosophy and I actually don't even understand why you're asking me this question the

(57:19) predication of why it's totally and completely Justified for me to do whatever the [ __ ] I want and anybody else to you is because you yourself say

(57:28) that you don't believe that there's a single argument in existence stop because you say there isn't a single

(57:34) argument in existence which you can offer as a reputation for why they shouldn't so if they if you can't offer

(57:41) why they shouldn't then why shouldn't they my qu you didn't answer my question that is answering your question no my

(57:48) question my you're asking a question back I my question to you is didn't ask question do you think no why do you

(57:54) think there are moral truth oh so you oh you want to know my epistemology well so for me it's divine command and it's

(58:00) based around Divine command Theory absolutely okay so so so for most of for the those of us who don't want to

(58:06) believe in Divine command based on absolutely no [ __ ] yeah why would you care you don't have an objective AR

(58:12) right so there are so I would even argue that there's no argument that further the well-being of society and there are

(58:17) one thing that will not you just don't know what those you can't make that argument because from your standpoint

(58:24) there's no possible way for me to be wrong in moral in Divine command Theory because you have zero justifications for

(58:31) any morality whatsoever and make the Bold claim there's not a single argument which can be offered against me having

(58:38) Divine command Theory you literally just said that that's what I mean it's just stupid just like nobody else can have uh

(58:44) like a a if someone said I'm getting my morals from Harry Potter and I'm going to go by The Wizarding World of Harry

(58:50) Potter I mean I Can't Tell You Why That's objectively morally wrong you're just a [ __ ] idiot to me and I'm so

(58:57) grateful that our your argument is structured stupid like it to be

(59:05) structured that's the reality of it so my second question was why should I a woman in modern society who lives in a

(59:12) secular country and that is a foundational pillar of my secular country go by your Divine command

(59:17) because you don't have a single reputational argument for why you shouldn't so therefore repal argument

(59:27) stop asking me questions and then not letting me answer them again I'm answering it as concisely as it can

(59:33) possibly be answered the reason is is because if you have literally no epistemology and offer zero reputations

(59:40) for why somebody shouldn't do anything to you no arguments against it no reason why you think it's right or wrong and

(59:47) they do do something to you you can't tell them that that's wrong or you can't tell them they shouldn't do that you

(59:52) have no basis for an oaim okay so this is the thing you're taking my deep deep deep deep moral like at the basis of my

(59:59) moral Foundation I say no you should do things because that's what the law say and

(1:00:05) that's also I believe this is and I agree it's what I believe you believe in your God and I believe that people

(1:00:11) should not harm other people because I think that overall the well-being of society is not going to be facilitated

(1:00:17) by that I also don't think for the well-being of of society is good to live in the with the kind of morality that

(1:00:22) you have and your weird Twisted version of your Divine command because I've never heard Christians like say that

(1:00:28) they would be okay with raping and killing people neither did I I never made the affirmative claim I would I asked a hypothetical to test your logic

(1:00:36) I never made the affirmative claim I'd be okay with anything no no no I asked you if you think that's okay and you said that yeah if 80% of women were

(1:00:43) getting killed if there was a greater duty to the human and every Christian would tell you the same

(1:00:49) thing let me finish let me finish every Christian would tell you every one of them would tell you that we operate off

(1:00:56) of Duty and virtue so we're going to look at each individual situation no matter how absurd the hypothetical and

(1:01:02) it's easy for me to bite a bullet and just say there would be a higher Duty then and almost all rational people on

(1:01:08) planet Earth would agree by the way yeah all ra okay I just want this I want to restate this and I also want all

(1:01:14) Christians to also take I want to know what most Christians would believe it is rational and it is Duty in my

(1:01:20) hypothetical to kill rape and force women say anything about killing I that

(1:01:25) is the rational Duty moral and that is the Christian response here I don't think the majority of Christians would

(1:01:31) agree with you if you were to ask any rational agent not just a Christian but almost everybody who's a rational agent

(1:01:38) if the perpetuation of the human species as an imperative was more important than

(1:01:44) a temporary condition of how women might feel they would say oh a temporary condition of my woman might feel because

(1:01:51) when in my hypothetical you you were talking about making them breed and then you were talking about breeding facilities and then having Bas on what

(1:01:58) condition based on what condition you know what I am totally fine I'm [ __ ]

(1:02:03) hilarious you stra man a million times it's you're hypothetical I am totally fine with leaving this here your

(1:02:09) position is that a rational agent would think that's Justified my position is that it's not and we could leave it

(1:02:15) there now to get back onto topic because we're we're not going to go into these crazy hypotheticals anymore right now 202 we just went into your crazy hypothe

(1:02:23) yeah that's what I'm saying Jasmine far I'm I'm done with them 20 I'm okay with leaving it there because your position is actually so [ __ ] insane that I I

(1:02:29) don't think there's more to be said so in 2023 your position that the human race goes extinct and you think that's

(1:02:34) rational why should I because this is the society I live in I I don't have a moral Foundation my epistemology is not

(1:02:41) so [ __ ] neat as to why this ought to be the case or whatever but it is the case because that's what the question of

(1:02:47) the debate is is patriarchy healthy or not healthy not should it be if if this

(1:02:53) Society was actually the way it is should it be if the Divine command was actually my question is what can you

(1:02:59) tell me right now and my life and the women like me why should we follow that

(1:03:05) yeah you just you just well you just actually refuted yourself in your question so your question that you asked

(1:03:11) me was this even though I Jasmine Jafar have absolutely no epistemology can't

(1:03:16) make any o claims nor tell you why anything is right and wrong why should I comply with whatever it is you tell me I

(1:03:23) ought to the answer on it's not on

(1:03:28) me saying lady you have to stop talking so I can explain this to you because you don't get it it's self-refuting so you

(1:03:36) asking lady stop you asking the question and by prefacing it with I have

(1:03:43) absolutely no moral objection to anything that you do but why should I follow what

(1:03:48) you well then can we get to whatever that is thing I just said I believe in

(1:03:54) generally the my moral principle which is based on my moral preference your moral preference is divine command mine is generally the no harm principle and I

(1:04:00) don't believe that I believe you should do whatever you want to makes you happy freedom I believe in Freedom I guess you don't but it shouldn't harm other people

(1:04:07) that's my moral principle now no harm principle then can you clarify what that means truth to I'm just asking you to

(1:04:13) clarify this one thing so so you're saying I should follow you so I ask you why should I do what you say and you say

(1:04:19) because it's self-evident in what I said is there any other reason is reason should listen why don't

(1:04:26) why don't you why don't you understand this if you make the affirmative claim that you Jasmine Jafar have no moral

(1:04:33) objections to anything that anybody does ever and canarchy and cannot produce one

(1:04:38) then if somebody comes in and says well you're GNA do this now you have no moral objection so why shouldn't you do it it

(1:04:45) doesn't even my point is it doesn't matter if I have a moral objection or not because if these people come in and force me to do [ __ ] it doesn't [ __ ]

(1:04:51) matter what my epistemology is or what my moral philosophy is if I'm and forced to breath how do you know what you should or shouldn't do question to you

(1:04:58) is do you know what you should do I have my relationship be centered or

(1:05:05) have patriarchal underpinning to my relationship you're saying just because it's so self-evident because I don't have I don't believe in objective

(1:05:11) morality so you're saying if there's no objective morality then you should be in you should uh have patriarchy in your

(1:05:17) relationship that's what you're let me really quickly bridge the gap I think Andrew what she's asking is from a utilitarian or from a consequence

(1:05:24) perspective why is your worldview or your system uh something that that would

(1:05:30) be beneficial to her or beneficial to her family I think that's what she's asking so I'm gonna I'm gonna I'll I'll try to answer this again for like the

(1:05:36) 17th time but don't cut me off this time and I'll just answer it okay if you were to say to me why

(1:05:44) shouldn't I impose feminism on you I'd say because of this objection that I have to it this moral objection that I

(1:05:50) have to it just let me finish if you were ask me if you were and you can ask

(1:05:55) as many times you want but the answer is not going to change because of this I would give you a reputation for why this

(1:06:02) ought not be the case I'm not asking why ought not [ __ ] up and let me finish so

(1:06:08) that you can you can't understand simple Concepts you're too stupid why can't you understand this why can't you [ __ ]

(1:06:15) understand a basic this is basic logic basic Alex just just why don't you get

(1:06:21) it like let me explain it just stop talking for a second so I can explain it to you okay if you if you ask me a

(1:06:29) question I can give you a moral reputation if I ask you for a moral reputation about anything about gum

(1:06:35) about why you don't want to [ __ ] pack a gum whatever it is if you have no reputation for why I shouldn't do that

(1:06:41) then there's no argument to be had because you're just conceding I can do whatever the [ __ ] I want all right are you finished can I okay so I'm gonna say

(1:06:47) again your whole thing started with not even about morals or anything it was about enforcement so my question to you

(1:06:53) again is if you don't have a way to enforce this or we're in modern society why should I listen to you should I only

(1:06:59) listen to you because I don't have a moral reputation as to what then if someone comes to me and says you should live your life as a furry and I go well

(1:07:06) I don't have I don't believe in objective morality so should I just live my life as a furry do my like are you

(1:07:11) actually awesome that you just said that so yes the answer would be if you have no moral objection to why somebody

(1:07:17) shouldn't live as a furry I guess you should let them live as a furry huh yeah I think I should let them live as a

(1:07:22) furry I'm asking you what I should wow I can't did you just understand my point finally why I do what you want like I

(1:07:29) I'm not talking like you're talking about amazing you don't have an enfor you can't if we're talking about this

(1:07:35) question the Crux of this debate is is patriarchy healthy or unhealthy for relationships you're like well we could

(1:07:40) right now you have no enforcement right you you know that you have no way to enforce the [ __ ] you want to enforce so in why what are you going to tell women

(1:07:47) right now modern women like me the ones that are running this [ __ ] country tell me exactly why with no enforc

(1:07:54) mechanism why I should listen to you I don't have to tell all of the women who

(1:07:59) are like you anything because you have no objection to any standard I would imply this is not the [ __ ] question

(1:08:05) Alex I just answered it 50 times like there's no better concise way can answer

(1:08:10) this so then that's my point you don't tell people that you should listen to what I say because you don't have an

(1:08:16) objective moral framework and I have a God that's not how you get people to to listen to you I'm asking you why two

(1:08:22) people right now who are living in New York in 2023 and they're like I don't know how to have our relationship and

(1:08:28) you're going to say well you should do my way because my book says so and she doesn't have a uh epistem like it

(1:08:34) doesn't have she doesn't have any objection to it then why wouldn't she do it I that's my my thing is do whatever

(1:08:40) you want but if she says actually I don't really want a man to I don't want there to be an imbalance of then that's an objection then that's an objection

(1:08:47) and then if you you say to her and then if you say to heral OB if you say to her then if you Mor I

(1:08:55) have a lot of objections to you're not listening then if you say to her then if you say to her oh okay you have that

(1:09:01) objective why do you have that objective and she goes actually I don't really have a reason why I have that I don't really have a reason I actually have no

(1:09:07) reason why I object to it then why the [ __ ] would you care why wouldn't she do it I don't care my point is if she's sitting right here and she goes I don't

(1:09:14) I don't think I'd be happy and I don't want my man to have to be the leader in the relationship I want things to be

(1:09:19) equal and you go do you have a moral basis for that no I just don't want to live my life that way you so that would

(1:09:25) be why would you listen to that what the [ __ ] kind of because because that would be what you're saying is that women have

(1:09:30) no logic then because that would be a presupposition based on nothing if you pointed that out and said wait a second

(1:09:35) are you presupposing something with zero justification she was like hang onp other tell her hey actually you

(1:09:44) should be the leader in the relationship and he shouldn't be the leader and if she not if she doesn't believe in objective morality and I'm like do you

(1:09:50) have a reason not to do that and she like not really then then why not have it be why not have it be that way

(1:09:56) understand that you can make a subjective moral argument too you just won't even do that you just say that there is no like I said in the beginning

(1:10:03) in my opening I believe that people should do what's best for them you're saying they should do what's best what

(1:10:09) based on their preferences and what makes them happy if it made everybody happy if it made everybody happy to

(1:10:16) imprison patriarch a patriarchal relationship wasn't make me happy what do you have what do you have actually

(1:10:24) can make me I'm gonna answer your question again I'll answer your question again under your metric under under your

(1:10:30) metric right now you just said you said the the metric that I have and I promise you said this is whatever makes them

(1:10:37) happy it's whatever makes people happy so what if it made people happy to lock up women and abuse them mercilessly and

(1:10:44) it made the majority of almost everybody happy on planet Earth to do this what would your objection be why is the and

(1:10:50) again the no harm principle Bas on Freedom until it infringes on someone else what what Foundation what but okay

(1:10:59) okay Alex can you let me know are we going to go down this because he just keeps trying to go down to the F but

(1:11:04) he's not answering my question and I think I I I would I hope the audience can see this I think it's pretty [ __ ]

(1:11:09) obvious I am talking about tell me why in my scenario where I say actually you

(1:11:14) should be the leader and she says self refuting I'm gonna bridge the gap again

(1:11:21) okay so what she's looking for is uh for example it will lead to this kind of outcome so she based argument right so

(1:11:28) you you need we don't have to worry about the outcome though because it's self-refuting it's literally self-refuting stupid thing that you

(1:11:35) should be you should be in a patriarchal relationship because otherwise it's self-refuting I don't think you're gonna

(1:11:41) convince a lot of people and I don't think you're getting just convinced a lot of people tonight after they watch this debate I

(1:11:46) promise about it then if it's just so self-re if if your argument is everyone

(1:11:51) you guys should be in a patriarchal relationship because otherwise it's just self-refuting then okay cool no my argument to you for your question to me

(1:11:59) you answer Alex's question do you have an answer to Alex you you hate me but what's Alex's so so I'm not debating

(1:12:05) with Alex so I'm debating with you so again he told you the question I actually have you won't answer me or you

(1:12:10) won't answer him asking you my question okay you know what let's try it this way why don't you Steelman my position and

(1:12:16) I'll Steelman your no say on stop stop stop stop steal man my position and I'll steal man yours that way we so I will do

(1:12:23) so talking just let me finish one point if you steal man my position and I steal man yours then we'll know we're not

(1:12:29) talking past no no no I want you to answer my question first because you are sitting there I've answered it four times and I feel like if you steal man

(1:12:35) it I feel like if you steal man it you'll get the answer no why why can't you just like is this like a

(1:12:41) [ __ ] possibly have answered it more concisely it's not even it's not possible that has my question we're

(1:12:48) gonna make a compromise really quick I I do like Andrew's idea of seal maning ch's position so you guys will do that really quick and then after that you

(1:12:54) will redirect that same question to Andrew I do think it's a good exercise to help make sure you guys are not talking past each other so Andrew why

(1:12:59) don't you start off by Steel Banning Jasmine's position yeah Jasmine's position it's kind of incoherent but

(1:13:05) I'll try to get as close as I possibly can she's saying that she thinks that we should do what's best for society based

(1:13:12) on a Loosely formed harm principle that seems to be what her argument

(1:13:18) is uh Andrew's position is that we should do what's Maybe for future

(1:13:24) Generations based on his moral philosophy of divine command and whatever he thinks is best for the rest

(1:13:29) of society honestly I like it's really hard to even know our positions especially when we're actually talking about the ACT did I do something wrong

(1:13:35) with your position or did I get it correct about my position on the just in

(1:13:41) general like that you should have a I do I think okay here's my position because I don't think you did a great job explaining it in one sentence well I'm

(1:13:47) just Ste I don't believe that we have unless you're going to do an appeal to an authority which is a fallacy you're the I don't like to bring up fallacies

(1:13:53) and debate because I think it's but whatever since you brought it nature an appeal to an authority is a fallacy and

(1:13:58) you think that or what my position is is that we don't have because I don't believe things based on insufficient

(1:14:04) evidence believing in Divine command is something believing in something based on insufficient evidence so that leaves us in a tough spot and there are difficult difficult questions in this

(1:14:10) life in a multitude of you steal man my position now what your your position is

(1:14:16) that uh well it's we we've gone through so many different topics we're going back to the original do you want me to steal ban your original Point me how

(1:14:22) about I just tell to you as concisely as possible so my position my position is is that you can't make any o claims

(1:14:28) because you don't believe in Morality at all and you won't give me any type of justification for your morality so anything that you say to me as an ought

(1:14:35) why ought I do anything is instantly I didn't tell you a you're telling me a you're saying that I'm the

(1:14:41) one that said people should do aren't you asking me why ought people follow my my uh Vision you're not allow you're the

(1:14:49) you think that you wait am I crazy okay now you have to answer my question okay because you believe in a you believe in

(1:14:55) ought so tell me why I ought in 2023 with the institutions we have in place

(1:15:01) now where you have no enforcement for what you want to any couple in the United States of America why should

(1:15:07) people you this is what you have to do you have to maybe this is why you're losing because you're going off into these abstract tot you're losing in the

(1:15:14) in I think there's no denying that you're in that our institutions like you had admitted are following my principles

(1:15:20) more than your principles but you're not you're not you're not breing how do you plan on changing that I think one of the

(1:15:25) ways you could change that is by changing people's minds that's why you're doing a debate right now and the debate question is you're saying that

(1:15:32) people should uh should have their relationships should have the relationships based on patriarchy or

(1:15:38) that there should be a patriarchal underpinning to people's relationships and I'm asking you what do you have to tell somebody like me because there's a

(1:15:45) lot of us like me probably more like me than like you what is your ought why should we ought listen to you doesn't

(1:15:51) matter what my underpinnings is doesn't matter why I ought not to or why I can't not do this or not do my question is

(1:15:57) tell me like Alex put it in a good way give me some type of reason why in this

(1:16:03) Society we should have our relationships like that if you

(1:16:10) cannot give me a disputation of any kind for why it is

(1:16:17) that I should not impose whatever I want on you from a standpoint of why it is

(1:16:23) wrong then it is a self-refuting question immediately you to do it because there's no literally to do it

(1:16:30) because you have no power to enforce it that was your original argument you have no power to enforce it it's not a moral

(1:16:37) claim but it is a claim really easy that why that is why people shouldn't listen

(1:16:42) to you because you have no power so now do you have an AR people shouldn't listen to me you're the one making self-refuting arguments right right away

(1:16:49) like your whole argument is self-re arum oh oh you can't you don't have a reason not to like I said then you then if I

(1:16:54) tell someone actually the woman should run the relationship or if someone tells me a woman should run the relationship I don't have a moral a reason why that

(1:17:00) shouldn't be the Rel so is that how I is that's not how people think I ask

(1:17:05) bringing you back down to earth why people think zero enforcement why should

(1:17:11) people listen to you here's your question here's how here's how [ __ ] insane your question is is right for

(1:17:17) them why here's how insane your [ __ ] question is excuse me sir do you think that murdering people is

(1:17:24) immoral uh I'm gonna murder you even AAL question I don't want you

(1:17:30) to I think that's immoral question I do it for you like this will

(1:17:37) you step away from I'm asking you because when we started this debate it wasn't even about morality you were talking about enforcement of rights that

(1:17:43) were completely separate from reality did you not so let's take morality completely out of this let's not talk

(1:17:48) about morality you can't take morality out of it your initial argu you're like you can give me no reason it's not that

(1:17:54) I can't give you a reason for it I just can't give you a moral objective reason

(1:17:59) for it that is true but that's not the only kind reason you can give has to be an

(1:18:05) objective moral reason there are other reasons they give me a subjective moral reason and you can't enforce it so for

(1:18:12) my question to you is knowing that you don't have the power knowing you don't have the enforcement knowing that our society is set up to actually have the

(1:18:19) relationships like this flourish and do well why should not do so why should we

(1:18:24) not I'm going to give you this Lifeline Lifeline just because I feel charitable right so I'll answer that how you want

(1:18:30) it answered right even though I've refuted it 50 times right yes the reason that you ought to do this right is

(1:18:38) because I just think that my preferences are like better than your preferences okay if that's if that's the reason then

(1:18:45) uh yeah good luck so do you don't have any objection then no my objection my objection is I don't think that's very

(1:18:52) convincing right I don't believe in objective but it's convincing from your angle I'm gonna steal a line I'm gonna

(1:18:57) steal a line no let me finish you ask me a question I'm gonna steal a line from Rich do I don't believe in objective reality I believe in intelligent design

(1:19:03) where we talk about our morals we we talk we debate them we do all that so right now that's what we're here to do

(1:19:09) debate what you think is right and what I think is right I age I don't have a foundation for it your foundation is a

(1:19:16) sky God so it's not much better honestly and my question to you is why should

(1:19:21) people where when they have all the power when they have the enforcement arm why should they listen to you the same

(1:19:28) reason they're supposed to listen to you because like it's just totally by preference I'm the one with the power I'm the one with all the institutions

(1:19:34) having my back so why should we listen to you then anything that we do in order both parties okay I'm gonna step in for

(1:19:39) a second we've been stuck on this point Andrew me right now I don't care we've been stuck on this argument for about 15 minutes and I think I want to move it

(1:19:45) forward so I Andrew can you engaged I understand the point you're trying to make is that her argument is not

(1:19:50) logically sound that's fine let's just for the sake of argument just say that just take that aside can you engage in

(1:19:55) what she's saying she's looking for consequences based answer right like why should why is like for example your

(1:20:01) viiew on relationships Superior from a consequences based perspective so let's just can you just engage in that so then

(1:20:06) we can then move it forward because we're a little bit stuck on this this okay I'm muting now I I'm engaging with

(1:20:12) it in as good of Faith as I can possibly engage with this question she just literally conceded it a second time when

(1:20:18) I said what's wrong with me just saying it's my preference she just said well good luck with that then there's no argument from this woman she has zero

(1:20:25) arguments Alex let's leave it there his argument his answer to your question on why people should listen to him is

(1:20:31) because he it feels like it or that it's divine command answer then there's no point you

(1:20:36) asked it I asked it he can't this is the answer he has answered it 50 times all right that's your answer all right Alex

(1:20:42) that's his answer chat that's his answer everyone watching that's his answer okay that's my answer everybody the same answer that she gave back at her she has

(1:20:49) no reputations for it I am completely fine leaving it right there

(1:20:54) because okay okay let me redirect so let me first the question like this to Andrew this is will kick off discussion

(1:21:00) Andrew just forget about the past hour and 20 minutes why do you why do you can you outline like some reasons why you

(1:21:06) think the patriarchy is good for relationships and then that will allow jasine to I guess engage in that uh yeah

(1:21:12) so the patriarchal order is always going to be good and the reason for this is

(1:21:17) that there's a descriptive underpinning for objective reality now I'm not talking about morality but reality and

(1:21:24) on the underpinning of the objective morality you are always going to need enforcement including at the micro level

(1:21:30) women can't enforce their own rights so I think it probably good for us to engage in what is objectively true and

(1:21:36) stop pretending that egalitarianism is true because it's not women don't really have rights as Jaz been conceited nobody

(1:21:41) has rights as Jaz been conceited all of us are just looking at enforcement as she conceited I don't even know what the

(1:21:47) hell she could possibly argue with all right at this point my argument back uh objective reality right now is that you

(1:21:53) guys don't have any kind of enforcement to enforce your patriarchal worldview in relationship so why should we start uh

(1:22:00) enforcing that on our oh but we do and you have no moral reputation for it Alex

(1:22:06) just said we're not doing moral I'm engaging literally with this on just a descriptive side right we still have as

(1:22:12) many numbers as you do almost we have the church Authority and church institutions which are almost as

(1:22:18) powerful as Government institutions at this point also yes itely they are yeah

(1:22:25) because church for sure yeah but church is a mass Community which leftist don't

(1:22:31) have leftists do not have Mass Community anymore only churches do okay do you know I'm gonna I just maybe this is me

(1:22:39) going into a little bit of lawyer stuff do you know that the Supreme Court what they say actually not only is the rule

(1:22:46) of law in the States but the church can't do something that the Supreme Court says they can't do do you did you

(1:22:52) know that so my question to you is you that at the highest ranks right now of

(1:22:57) enforcement the church that's not enforcement the high who's if if okay

(1:23:03) well unless the churches and all these people that you're saying are going to come and again do the sword fight my question to you is right now in modern

(1:23:11) society we have the power we have the institutions we have no laws we have no

(1:23:16) anything that's saying that this is the way that relationships should be and a lot of people are choosing by their own

(1:23:22) own they're making their autonomous decision that they don't want to be in this kind of relationship so why is it

(1:23:27) good other than you saying it is objective reality that it's good and that's objective reality that if men

(1:23:33) wanted to they could enforce it but it's also objective reality right now that the powers are in the institutions and

(1:23:39) if you want to overthrow that you have to overthrow the institions so until you can do that until you can overthrow all our institutions with your little

(1:23:45) Crucible Revolution why should we now listen to you why would it take why would it take I don't even understand

(1:23:51) why would it take a revolution tion for us to take back institutions uh well you were saying

(1:23:57) that you're trying to Rally a group of people yeah to vote on stuff right

(1:24:03) doesn't even necessarily mean Constitution that says that our country is secular unless you're going to get rid of secularism which I think if you

(1:24:09) want to get rid of secularism you do need a revolution I'm I she keeps freezing up I don't even

(1:24:15) know what she saying pre pre pre voting you have to repeat have to repeat there

(1:24:22) for a second we lost like about 20 seconds of that can you repeat your whole argument my uh you lost what how

(1:24:28) many how much like most of what you said 20 30 seconds back basically okay sorry

(1:24:33) uh let me just you're good so my my argument is right now if you want to change things right you have to

(1:24:40) basically change our institutions and you have to if you want to really change things outside of secularism I'm going

(1:24:45) to predict that you would actually need a revolution to make this country a not secular country that's my prediction

(1:24:50) outside of that before you Lobby Congress before the churches do their whatever they're going to do to change

(1:24:55) our system right now in 2023 in this system the objective reality is there is

(1:25:02) no enforcement there is no means of enforc okay where is it where where is

(1:25:07) the enforcement that patriarchy is the way that relationships should be well because it's necessarily A patriarchy

(1:25:12) because they are the men are the enforcement so it's a necessary entailment to the claim okay so again

(1:25:19) this is just circular because I'm saying like a woman like me a young whatever woman is here and they're like hey I'm dating this guy and

(1:25:26) we don't have a patriarchal relationship and you go well it's self-evident that you do because you just do like is that

(1:25:32) the argument here I'm asking you why if because clearly as you know there are

(1:25:37) plenty of relationships that aren't patriarchal unless you're saying that all of them are then tell me what I'm

(1:25:42) saying is that because so what I'm so what I'm saying specifically is that because Society is already a patriarchy

(1:25:51) and all societies will always be patriarchies because of the underpinning of enforcement that my ought claim is

(1:25:57) because this is true this should be recognized right and it should further be promoted because it creates the most

(1:26:05) stable Foundation because it's based the closest on what is objectively descriptively true so then if it's

(1:26:12) already just the case and it's true then you have no problems with the way relationships are today no I didn't say

(1:26:18) that why would that even be an entailment of this he said that it's it's just natur patriarchal the society's naturally patriarchal well

(1:26:25) clearly our society is saying [ __ ] that and there there's aity there was one thing in there that

(1:26:31) actually do you not understand what a modality is like it could be more patriarchal less patriarchal said

(1:26:37) stability okay I'd love to go there because everything else you're saying is [ __ ] so stability you're saying that this is that's an argument you're saying

(1:26:43) finally answering the analysis question maybe that the one answered your questions one thing you could tell people is oh this is the way we should

(1:26:50) set the up uh relationship because it's more stable what is your evidence as to why those relationships are more stable

(1:26:57) because all of the enforcement for all of society is coming from The Men Who necessarily have to protect the woman in

(1:27:03) the relationship so they're a necessary stabilizing Force for the relationship

(1:27:08) regardless of circumstance anywhere you are on planet Earth at any given time is always going to be the men who are the

(1:27:13) necessary stabilizing Force because they have the Monopoly on the problem is the Men Mo major you need the

(1:27:20) majority of men right it's not one man and the we don't need the majority of okay you need the men right now they

(1:27:27) don't they don't agree with you that's my point so you haven't gotten actually men themselves they're

(1:27:34) not on your side they're like I I don't know they don't have to be all that has to all that woman I'm okay with this

(1:27:40) you're saying no no no no no because you could enforce it but these men right now are enforcing what I say so if I if

(1:27:47) these men are following my ideology then these men like you said men can take

(1:27:52) take away rights from other men but these men are enforcing my rights not your the one you want so what is your

(1:27:58) argument then your argument has to be that you have to take over these institutions that's the only way otherwise what other argument do you

(1:28:04) have that's why I was trying to go into stability or something else but I've already told you inrease your happiness

(1:28:10) I don't know why you're restating things I've already said I already told you that getting the institutions would

(1:28:16) definitely be part and partial for why or uh a necessary entailment for how we

(1:28:21) get more patriarchy or at least patriarchy instituted in the way I'd like to see it seen is that we would

(1:28:27) have to move into the institutions but do you need all men to do that of course not that's ridiculous no more than you

(1:28:33) need no more than you would need all women in to promote feminism because

(1:28:38) most of them shut and let me finish I've been letting you prattle for hours just relax for a second for hours so again

(1:28:45) very few women actually wanted feminism it was a very very small percentage most women were against suffrage and you did

(1:28:52) not need all the women in order to get suffrage all you need is to convince enough people that hey you actually have

(1:28:58) the institutional Authority the second that you want it and you don't have to live like this it's not actually as

(1:29:04) difficult as you're making it out to be what percentage so let's say all the women are against this what percentage

(1:29:09) of and then there's a percentage of men that are on our side and your side what percentage do you think we need to overthrow our institutions and well if

(1:29:16) so necessarily entailed in the hypothetical if you say all women are

(1:29:21) against then from a democratic perspective they men couldn't do it at least

(1:29:27) notp the only reason I was trying to put it in genders because you think that men have more power than women so I was saying okay let's say [ __ ] all the women

(1:29:34) what percentage of men do you need for this to happen and my second question is then would it be okay to say that until

(1:29:39) you make this come to fruition then we can kind of form our relationships however we want because we have the enforcement you don't have the

(1:29:45) enforcement men men still have the enforcement wom do not have enforcement the men I agree with you I agree that I

(1:29:52) think that and there are a lot of men that are also believe in feminist principles in fact like I said most of

(1:29:57) them so my point is is that most of them do not believe in feminist egalitarian a lot of maybe okay a lot of relationships

(1:30:03) right now the men aren't AR aren't you you're not you're not reflective of I would say the majority of men so my

(1:30:10) question is then if you're saying that the enforcement but I mean are you reflective of the majority of women how

(1:30:16) we should Center our relationships if you don't have that at this point from most from women or men enough men to to

(1:30:22) make your thing come come true then should we wait until then and then have our relationships but we already do have

(1:30:28) enough men if you take a look for instance at the why isn't it working lady lady why won't you shut up so I can

(1:30:34) answer your [ __ ] question I'm gonna give a 10minute warning before we move on to closing thoughts and Callin so

(1:30:39) just their heads up okay go ahead yeah so again if you look at like what happened with Trump and Trump selection

(1:30:46) right which was a smack in the face against the feminist arm and the leftwing Democrat arm it was mostly men

(1:30:53) who voted a men men do not vote alongside women on many many many issues

(1:30:59) and as you can clearly see more men are moving to the right via the trends women are moving more to the left that's true

(1:31:06) but as women get married they tend to vote how their husband votes can we convince enough menri can we now hang on

(1:31:12) can we convince enough men over the next what 50 60 70 80 years as progressives

(1:31:18) continuously delete themselves from existence by not having children in order to push towards institutional

(1:31:24) power yes we can and we should and that's exactly what I promote we should

(1:31:29) do example you can't even replicate yourself your example was perfect if the majority of men wanted Trump to win and

(1:31:36) they even tried illegally January 6 to make it happen and it still didn't work

(1:31:42) I'm not talking about that on YouTube but but I'm saying use a different example use a king use a different

(1:31:48) example even as men even as men wanted that to happen more so than women did it

(1:31:54) didn't work Trump is not our president and our democracy as of now is still intact so my question to you is you're

(1:32:00) believing that it's going to change in the future M let's stop talk you're still not understanding the pivotal now

(1:32:05) right now you're still not understanding the pivotal underpinning this actually makes my point again for me so again you

(1:32:11) just say that to say that if men are not if men are not making the enforcement arm on behalf of other men if they're

(1:32:18) doing it on behalf of women it's still men who are doing the enforcement still men essentially who are making the decisions that women have rights or

(1:32:24) don't have rights no matter how come all the men that voted for Trump weren't able to make why why couldn't Trump why

(1:32:29) why did that not work because they the enforcement of other men who were part of the institutional power were able to suppress them men it's still men it's

(1:32:37) always men even if it's still men it all your your patriarchy only works if men want the patriarchy that's my point and

(1:32:44) so my point is if in today's society a lot of men all of the men I know don't

(1:32:49) want your Society they want my Society why should we have our relationship because absent and not claim for why I

(1:32:56) shouldn't do it we should absolutely be pushing as far as hard as we possibly

(1:33:01) can shut up and let me answer your question I listen to your I listen to all your nonsense prattle and the second

(1:33:07) I start to give you an answer you cut in so again I'm gonna try to explain this to you again we should be pushing

(1:33:14) towards that just because it's not a descriptive reality right now that the right-wing or that the patriarchal

(1:33:20) version of men or that the religious men are in institutional power doesn't mean we shouldn't be pushing so that they are

(1:33:27) and unless you have a single argument for why we shouldn't do that then there's nothing you have to argue at all

(1:33:32) my argument as to why we shouldn't do that is I don't think it's going to be best for the well-being of society and right now since we have that power my

(1:33:39) question to you is right now before people change it why we're talking about relationships now if you want to get into politics and you can say yeah you

(1:33:46) guys should Lobby communist shouldn't have ever lobed to get rid of Communism want even to say that they should invade the capital for it my question is what

(1:33:53) actual of when you don't have the enforcement arm you currently don't have it so my question is if you currently

(1:34:00) don't have it should we currently not follow it because there's no enforcement mechanism you currently aren't so what's

(1:34:05) happening is as long as men male enforcement favors whatever the agenda is that men favor in this case if men

(1:34:12) favor feminism then that's still the patriarchy giving us feminism it's not women giving us feminism it's patriarchy

(1:34:19) giving us feminism so we're still at the no matter what of the patriarchy is a descriptive reality why do you not get

(1:34:25) this let me let me try this then what is a patriarchal relationship to you and if it's a descriptive reality then why

(1:34:32) aren't people living that so so tell me what is a patriarchal relationship they are trying to live that way what ends up

(1:34:38) happening though is the rights of women get enforced over the rights of men by other men we end up with this massive

(1:34:44) problem called I don't think a lot of end with this massive stop talking [ __ ]

(1:34:49) you just won't shut up again what ends up happening every single time or at

(1:34:55) least now it's almost every single time is this thing we call divorce divorce happens non-stop right so essentially

(1:35:02) the enforcement arm right in this case patriarchal enforcement arm right who's

(1:35:08) under the purview of your feminist ideology will go in and enforce your rights for you we want the patriarchy to

(1:35:14) enforce the rights of my agenda not of your agenda okay I see that but my

(1:35:19) question can you answer the question what is because I'm going to try it different way because I think you're you obviously think I'm [ __ ] crazy and I

(1:35:25) honestly truly think I don't think you're crazy think no my question is what isal what is a patriarchal

(1:35:31) relationship what is some what does that look like to you uh just as I think it would look the same way it would look to

(1:35:37) you it essentially be U men are at the Forefront they're in charge and they have the most rights over the family and

(1:35:43) the most duties and responsibility as well so even when we're talking about in General Dynamics between men and women

(1:35:48) and rights and in the family a lot of that isn't even legally enforced in the first place so my question to you is if

(1:35:54) we're getting rid of all the legal stuff why should people it is legally enforced what do you mean it's leg so so

(1:36:02) so let's say so let's say we have um so I'll give you an example let's say we have like a patriarchal relationship

(1:36:08) right or at least in your purview what you consider one I consider one to be and the woman like halfway through they

(1:36:14) live for five years this way and the chick's like I don't want to live this way anymore right and so she goes and

(1:36:20) appeals to secular Authority and secular Authority then involves enforcement to dissolve the marriage

(1:36:25) it's actually not really a patriarchal relationship at that point right this is an enforcement mechanism from women said

(1:36:33) it was patriarchy well did you not hear what I just said I said it's a patriarchal

(1:36:38) enforcement mechanism when we're talking about patriarchy though we need to see men at the heads of families at the

(1:36:44) heads of government and we need to see them at the heads of all households this would be the top down patriarchal order

(1:36:50) okay so if men say that actually patriarchy to us is that men aren't the leaders and they aren't this and this is

(1:36:55) what we want to enforce is that a version of patriarchy so all societies are always

(1:37:01) going to be operating descriptively under some version of patriarchy it's unavoidable this is my point in my opening to tell you this that all

(1:37:08) societies so if these men are saying that we they're they're making the

(1:37:13) decisions according to you but the decision that they're making is that we don't want to be the head of the family we don't want these kinds of Rights in

(1:37:19) taken away or enforced then isn't it just a reflection of the patriarchy that you're purporting to up uh that you're

(1:37:25) purporting exist that your values maybe aren't the values of the patriarchy then no it is possible in this particular

(1:37:33) case it's it not only is it possible but it happened that over 70 years of feminist propaganda that the patriarchal

(1:37:41) system the adhere to patriarchal system Men actually have forgotten that any

(1:37:46) time we choose we can simply take rights away from women it's always men just forgot that it's it's not that they

(1:37:51) actually don't no I said that they were propagandized into it we know that they were propagandized and here I can

(1:37:57) demonstrate this with proof we know that they were propagandized into this because you didn't start with these rights and you didn't get them until

(1:38:04) recently and the reason you get the reason you didn't get them until recently is because you could not

(1:38:11) enforce them so why would men give you rights you can't enforce oh well black people only got rights recently this yes

(1:38:18) men can take rights away from men and men can give men rights that's and that's what I'm saying if men if because

(1:38:23) you're saying it the men are the ones who give the right so if men choosing what if is it possible that they're not

(1:38:28) brainwashed or forgetting is it possible that this is a reflection of the patriarchal values that men themselves

(1:38:36) no this is a value of feminist values and not of patriarchal what if the feminist values because the

(1:38:42) equalitarianism would be the feminist value the men are adopting these values and you're saying that the being

(1:38:48) brainwashed yes there are men who are patriarch some men there are some men who are brainwashed into believing

(1:38:54) egalitarian principles because they're unthinking just like you they not brainwashed or is it 100% they

(1:38:59) brainwasher yes it's it's a been I can demonstrate the brainwashing for you over the last 70 years it's been ongoing

(1:39:06) and nonstop What wave hang on what wave of feminism What wave of feminism are we on

(1:39:12) now there's no brainwashing I'm not saying there's no brainwashing at all anywhere in society but I'm saying it's not self-evident or

(1:39:19) it's not automa be self evident have now as a society whether

(1:39:25) it's about race whether it's about gender are all a reflection of brainwashing what if this is what people

(1:39:30) want men and women and we're in a patriarchal society where men are deciding what goes and men are deciding

(1:39:37) that what goes is feminist beliefs what if it's not brainwashing what if that's just the way that things are and that's

(1:39:43) the way men want them all because all for listen stop talking all form of

(1:39:50) government thought all form of government thought is propaganda you can see this in communism are you saying

(1:39:55) that Communists weren't brainwashing people are you saying in North Korea stop are you saying North Korea they're not brainwashing people why are you not

(1:40:02) let me finish are you saying in every single nation on planet Earth that patriotism is not a form of brainwashing

(1:40:08) feminism is not a form of brainwashing that from this time that you're a little kid stop from the time that you're a

(1:40:15) little kid in school the fact that you're being leeched and feminism is part of the very air that you and you're

(1:40:21) told about egalitarianism over and over that we're all equal over and over it's completely leeched in to society and you

(1:40:28) just pretend it doesn't exist the form of patriarchy that I advocate for I'm

(1:40:34) almost done lady the form of patriarchy that I advocate for is not even workable

(1:40:39) inside of stop talking I'm almost done is and I'm almost done then he can talk

(1:40:46) the form of patriarchy which I advocate for doesn't even work inside of secularism by the way secularism working

(1:40:54) it's it can't no it doesn't work it doesn't work or you wouldn't have a society that can't reproduce if that's

(1:41:01) your only argument is that okay then just wait then just wait because apparently we're all going to come out of existence and then when you're dead

(1:41:07) then you can that's actually the plan that's the whole that's the right- wings plan is to is to slowly move towards

(1:41:13) institutional power as you breed yourself out of existence I think we'll just wait and until then I think people

(1:41:19) you guys should live your relationships how want because as Andrew stated the men are the ones who are enforcing it

(1:41:24) and the men don't agree with Andrew and the men agree that you should be able our country our founding fathers not

(1:41:31) even now but before said that Divine command and Andrew's belief system isn't the one that they wanted as opposed to

(1:41:37) absolutely nothing warning one minute warning go ahead as opposed absolutely nothing I honestly

(1:41:44) feel like he's just basically saying like oh this is just it's clear brainwashing but Andrew isn't

(1:41:50) brainwashing anybody and that it's men men actually don't want this they just don't know any better and once they see

(1:41:56) the light then Everything Will Change okay cool let's wait for it but in the meantime when we're running [ __ ] when we're running Academia we're running

(1:42:02) media we're running [ __ ] everything I'm G to live how I see fit and I implore everybody else to have your

(1:42:08) relationship the way you see fit and in fact I actually agree that you should because you're thinking yourselves right

(1:42:15) out of existence your birth rates are dropping so [ __ ] drastically and so many people are moving over only the

(1:42:21) religious are reproducing more women into breeding facility facilities and then because every generation is

(1:42:27) thinking more and more like me younger that's fine you're gonna end up dying with five cats and a bunch of dudes fap

(1:42:32) to you reproducing you should be able to counter that if you can repr are we are countering it we wait it because right

(1:42:38) now all the polling says that young gen Z is even more Progressive than Millennials in every generation before

(1:42:44) that they don't breed what happens we're moving okay we'll see you're saying we're don't breed what Happ so

(1:42:51) I want to let you I want I want to let you know where the end where the end of this goes for for you guys right human

(1:42:57) extinction because you can see that you no not human extinction the opposite

(1:43:02) it's ideological extinction because if you concede that most people tend to

(1:43:07) follow their parents morality they tend to follow their parents religion they tend to follow their parents politics even right then a necessary entailment

(1:43:15) of the left not breeding and they're not and they're going to continue that spir roll down is that you're going to

(1:43:22) inevitably lose power and as I sit here and actually explain these things to

(1:43:28) leftist explain them and they see it you're so ideological or ideologically

(1:43:34) set on must be [ __ ] that you can't even fathom that the Next Generation the

(1:43:40) generation after are going to literally wink out of existence because you can't sustain yourself I have two responses

(1:43:46) and then I think our our minute is up number one most educated people who do tend to lead liberal are the ones that

(1:43:51) actually they're they're actually having more babies than before it's the poorer people that are having less than before a b uh what was my second Point um [ __ ]

(1:44:01) I forgot it um great so educated people are GNA weak out of existence no oh my second point is that you're saying this

(1:44:07) but every generation is always more Progressive than the generation before that and this trend has been going and going for a while now so I don't know

(1:44:14) when why you think it'll reverse or how it will reverse but I will wait to see that um and hopefully like you said our

(1:44:20) life question for you're G to change the whole system great and Through The Crucible we wait for that to do you have

(1:44:25) a s I just have question I have one last question one last one I mean can you

(1:44:31) give me a single a now that I've answered your question can you give me stop stop can you give me a single a for

(1:44:38) why men should follow feminism men should follow feminist because feminist ideology and the values that we purport

(1:44:45) have convinced them through reason through logic you say it's

(1:44:51) brainwashing I'm say just literally said because

(1:44:56) propaga one in the marketplace of ideas we won in the marketplace of ideas we're continuing to win in the marketplace of

(1:45:02) ideas and until you can change that whether through enforcement or through the marketplace of ideas we the ones

(1:45:08) that are running [ __ ] so I think that answers your question you to do it because that's what's currently being

(1:45:14) done continue but I also [ __ ] genius what a genius response in your closing

(1:45:21) statement uh Jasmine's going to go first and she W first totally sum up your thoughts all right ja so anyway so this was a [ __ ] heated debate uh very

(1:45:28) enjoyable I enjoyed uh the contention we're gonna get into closing statements now then we'll do super chats and then

(1:45:34) uh we'll do some caller inss and stuff like that probably go for another 25 30 minutes not too long uh so Jasmine

(1:45:39) closing statements take I guess up to five minutes uh whatever your thoughts are final closing thoughts go ahead um I

(1:45:46) mean I don't I feel like this is derailed so much that I don't it's just G so many plac so I don't even if to

(1:45:51) take it back to the original question um are patriarchal relationships healthy

(1:45:57) for society like I said luckily we live in a society right now where with all and he he wants things to change right

(1:46:04) now they're not changing it doesn't seem like they're going to change like I said we hold most of the power and doesn't I

(1:46:09) don't see as as new generations are coming up they're becoming more Progressive they believe in our values more and more our values are actually

(1:46:15) spreading to the rest of the world actually even in other like patriarchal societies example my family's from Iran

(1:46:21) you're seeing the younger generation in Iran becoming more secular less religious and they actually don't have

(1:46:27) the Democracy we have so they're not able to at this point have that reflected in their societies but we are

(1:46:32) lucky enough I am so privileged I think [ __ ] I I'm so grateful every day I

(1:46:38) think the universe all the time that the fact that I was able to be born in a country where we believe in secularism

(1:46:44) and we believe in Freedom and that we were able to convince enough people men and women that this is a better way way

(1:46:50) to live and I think us is amazing country I think we're living I think we're doing great he thinks that we're

(1:46:55) birth we're on the verge of Extinction I do not think that and I think that people should do whatever feels good in their relationships if you're a

(1:47:01) traditional woman and you feel really great with your F your your father or your I mean not father the father of

(1:47:07) your children or your husband having the authority over you and you want to be the Homemaker and they want to go be the bread winner have at it I I I think

(1:47:14) that's a beautiful way to live I also think it's a beautiful way to live to have two people working and to have nobody have more power or authority over

(1:47:21) the other to have a partnership I think that's beautiful too my point is I don't my ideology doesn't hinge on everybody

(1:47:28) else following it um when it comes to relationships I think relationships are very personal I think relationships uh

(1:47:34) one of the foundational pillars of our country is the right to privacy is the right that you what goes on in people's

(1:47:40) individual households and their bedrooms and stuff isn't anybody's business Andrew May disagree I'm happy to live in

(1:47:46) a country where we believe in that so however people want to have their relation ships the way they see fit that isn't harming other people I don't think

(1:47:53) they have to worry about future uh uh you know they have to go to the extent

(1:47:58) of getting in breeding facilities so that future people can live uh I'm personally not too worried about someone

(1:48:04) like Andrew gaining enough power whether it's political power or or just power of the masses to actually uh Implement any

(1:48:11) of his views and all of the evidence shows me um more and more and more except for beer companies everything

(1:48:17) else shows that uh my ideology is not only what's on top but it's continuing with with future generations and I think

(1:48:24) that's all I got to say all Andrew you are up yeah so you saw that uh Jasmine

(1:48:30) almost thank the god that she doesn't believe in to live in the egalitarian nation that is so good that she can't

(1:48:37) give me a single justification for why you ought to live in one yourself or follow

(1:48:42) egalitarianism at all she can't give a single argument for anything in fact she

(1:48:47) never gave a single argument for one thing she never gave a single argument for her moral ODS when I turned her

(1:48:54) hypothetical back around for her to answer it she said you shouldn't even do that you according to her there should

(1:49:00) be no secular or at least she says women like me there should be no objection to

(1:49:06) anything that anybody's doing at any time anywhere because she has zero reputation to tell a person why they

(1:49:13) shouldn't none not any not even a little bit she couldn't offer anything that was

(1:49:19) it was like stunning and didn't even understand that she was refuting her own arguments every time that she made one

(1:49:26) by saying that she has no justification for why you should do that other than her own personal preference that's the

(1:49:33) only justification she needs if that's true as I rightly pointed out then whatever my preference is has to be

(1:49:39) equally as true she points out yes that's true and it's like well then what the [ __ ] is this all about anyway

(1:49:44) clearly anything that I'm doing and want to impose on any part of society is 100%

(1:49:50) moral from her perspective because she can't offer a single argument for why it wouldn't be not a single one and when

(1:49:57) she does object she says my objection is hollow because I have no moral argument to give you with the objection so thing

(1:50:03) is bad why is it bad because I I don't because it is it just is it I don't like

(1:50:10) murder okay but why shouldn't we murder people I don't know I just I don't I have no idea right this is how dumb

(1:50:17) asses think okay what you need to do is try to understand that not only that she couldn't give a reputation to the

(1:50:23) descriptor of society she actually agreed with my descriptor for how Society works even right the whole

(1:50:28) debate was conceded from the outset and the only thing she can hang her hat on was but descriptively right now it's

(1:50:34) this way which has nothing to do with anything at all why would how it descriptively operates right now have to

(1:50:40) do with how we want Society to look has nothing to do with it absolutely [ __ ] insane it was one of the most insane

(1:50:46) debates I've ever been in because of the unawareness of the opponent as to what she was even saying but anyway with that

(1:50:52) I'll con see the time and no hard feelings right no I appreciate the debate okay yeah let's just end it there

(1:51:00) I I'm happy with the way this ended up I'm I'm pretty happy with this I don't think it was I feel like it was great so

(1:51:07) so I actually wrote down I want to ask both of you guys an interesting question that I uh it's gonna be separate questions it's kind of things that I was

(1:51:14) thinking about as debate was going off so let's just start with you Jasmine since Andrew spoke last so I I I want to

(1:51:20) flip the question that you were trying to ask Andrew what are some consequences based arguments why why the patriarchy is bad for

(1:51:26) relationships I if you remember my my original opening was not that it's bad or good I think it's dependent on the

(1:51:32) people in the relationship so some people lean I think in traditional like they have a proclivity towards

(1:51:38) traditional gender roles and I think that's great and I think there are certain people that don't and I think a society that allows for both type of

(1:51:44) relationship flourish like this one is better than one that forces everybody to do one thing and everyone to do another

(1:51:50) thing because even though we may have General like there may be more men that are more uh that have more of a procity

(1:51:56) towards being a leader or the authority in a relationship that doesn't mean that there is that's everybody and there's actually a ton of overlap and I think

(1:52:03) allowing for that let's say it's even 70 30% I think that it's good to let that 30% or whatever percent I think it's

(1:52:08) more than that um live their lives how they see fit I think our society is doing better than most patriarchal

(1:52:14) societies I think a lot of people want to come to this country for a reason and one of those reasons is the freedom to be able to live their lives how they see

(1:52:21) fit I'm talking more in a macro perspective not in a micro perspective so the you know the US can either be

(1:52:27) patriarchal or not patriarchal right the society be that or not so from a macro perspective would you say there's any

(1:52:33) detriments for the society overall from macro perspective to be patriarchal when it comes to like individual

(1:52:39) relationships or no uh if like you're saying if like for there to be some

(1:52:44) people who are in patriarchal relationships or like just everybody talk about society as a whole like society as a whole so do you think that

(1:52:51) I think that society as a whole should uh like enforce or to promote

(1:52:56) patriarchal relationships is that more of your question no I'm if we have a fullon like patriarchal society right

(1:53:02) okay how do you see that negatively affecting people's individual relationships like we're not talk societ

(1:53:07) forcing we're talking about like all of the representation for example in Congress and people positions of Power are men right we're talking about that

(1:53:13) type of society right was like 100 years ago right like yeah so yeah I I don't think that's good because we are 50% of

(1:53:20) the [ __ ] uh world and we have brains we have the ability We Have Skills right

(1:53:26) there are some skills we do better like for instance women companies run by women are less likely to go bankrupt

(1:53:32) than companies run by men but companies run by men because they're more they're less risk averse they tend to sometimes

(1:53:37) make more money what does that tell you I think that tells you that there is uh there we want both types of people in

(1:53:43) the world instead of just having one type of person right um I think more male teachers are great I think more

(1:53:48) female Engineers are are great women clearly we have the ability we're our test scores are across the board even

(1:53:55) higher than men so clearly like even my profession as a lawyer is almost 50% women and I think those women are

(1:54:01) performing and doing their jobs as a lawyer just as well as men are so I think it's good and if women the women

(1:54:06) on the Supreme Court are just as capable of being there as the men I think if we're going to live in a real meritocracy which I think is a good idea

(1:54:12) then the people that are best equipped for the job should do it and eliminating half of the population I don't think is

(1:54:18) a good I got a quick followup right there um can you is there any Behavior

(1:54:25) at all that does not follow on this threshold of like of harming somebody

(1:54:30) else just any independent beh this Rel I I really just want to know the answer to this is there any Behavior at all that

(1:54:38) doesn't that doesn't like hurt somebody else that you would say is bad anything incest Inc necrophilia any of those

(1:54:45) things so there so there's a behavior that's detrimental to yourself like eating too much junk food like I

(1:54:51) wouldn't say that that's something that I would say is a good thing for someone to do but it's not my [ __ ] business if someone wants to eat a bunch of

(1:54:57) donuts into what about necrofilia is that any of your business I would say that there is harm in in uh doing that

(1:55:05) to the dead because obviously if that person like they have what if they consent what if they consent beforehand

(1:55:10) that they want their dead body moled consent beforehand honestly then sure then necrophilia is okay for society if

(1:55:16) the person like literally is like I when I die and they're of a they're of a state of mind where they can consent to

(1:55:22) it sure yeah and twin brothers having incestual relationships with each other twin twin fine uh as long as there's no

(1:55:30) procreation involved I can't say that it's morally wrong no so can you say any behavior Can you say any behavior is

(1:55:37) morally wrong then if it doesn't cross this threshold of hurting somebody else if it doesn't harm somebody I don't

(1:55:43) think I could say it's morally wrong but I your whole point with me is I can barely say anything's morally wrong so okay that's true you're obsessed with

(1:55:50) this question I think we've we've done it we've we've done this for almost two hours it was is not even super relevant

(1:55:56) to the [ __ ] thing but if you want to go on I will do a separate debate with you again Andrew even though you're insufferable about moral morals but that

(1:56:03) wasn't the question that I was asking all all empirical claims have to do with morality all okay let me hang on let's I

(1:56:09) don't I want to or not empirical but all claims all claims you make are going to have a moral Foundation is what I meant to say Sor okay anyway so anyway so I

(1:56:16) want to ask Jasmine that question and then here I have a question for you answer two-part question so do you think we should always do what's good for the

(1:56:22) collective and future Generations I'm sorry was that a question for me yes so do you think we

(1:56:28) should always do what's good for the collective and for future Generations no okay so then the follow question is how

(1:56:34) do you determine uh whether we should do that thing or not do that thing if uh you know like what's what's what's the

(1:56:40) what's the limit test that we're using yeah so there would be um essentially a hierarchy of Duties and virtues and this

(1:56:47) would fall under Divine command as well so there could be certain aspects which would be really really bad uh you know

(1:56:54) for for future Generations let's say if you implemented a maybe some some sort

(1:57:00) of Duty that they had to adhere to uh that we would say was okay how do we

(1:57:05) determine the duties of hierarchies uh well because we have church history we have the Bible we have

(1:57:11) Divine command we have divine revelation okay so you basically full on theocracy right well it wouldn't be a theocracy it

(1:57:17) wouldn't be necessary most people's Morality In the way that they legislate is informed by their upbringing and

(1:57:23) their religion so almost every law that you see is a reflection of that in fact so even even the Constitution which was

(1:57:30) based on Anglican ideas uh is based on their kind of uh bizarre mixture ad

(1:57:36) mixture of um you know like the scoffield Bible type thinking so this is

(1:57:42) almost everybody's morality and how they govern is going to be informed by their morality do you think that um soft drug

(1:57:50) sorry I'm gonna I have to uh somebody's at the door I'm gonna go get the door I'll be right back sure do you think

(1:57:56) that soft drugs should be legalized like marijuana mushrooms stuff like that I'm

(1:58:01) neutral on it I don't care if they are or they aren't okay F yeah uh yeah you answer this question actually a little

(1:58:07) differently than I expected so yeah fair enough uh so I mean mushrooms yes uh but like if you're talking about like um I

(1:58:14) don't know maybe maybe marijuana or something like that I could say that I'm probably probably neutral on it though I

(1:58:21) think that I could be swayed one way or the other so are you saying that you don't think that TRS should be legalized

(1:58:27) yeah not not psychedelics no why would you say that it's an it's in because it

(1:58:32) Alters the brain state to the point that it's it's actually not even Dosa controllable very easily and you don't

(1:58:39) know we still don't really understand the long-term ramifications of psychedelics um the MK Ultra program for

(1:58:46) instance utiliz psychedelics often in order order to make people more palatable to mind control that's

(1:58:53) actually true they really did do that and they they also pushed out um you

(1:58:59) know or it it was talked about pushing out these things uh in water and things like this to make people more

(1:59:04) susceptible through micro doing to the power of suggestion and propaganda so I think that yeah those are those are

(1:59:11) awful now chat yelling saying weed could have the same effect I doubt that it has

(1:59:16) the same effect to that degree you know what I mean but I agree that the MK Ultra program is

(1:59:22) not good but I'm just talking about more on a broad basis aside from like evil government programs like you're the

(1:59:28) point you made is that it Alters uh brain chemistry but doesn't alcohol do the same exact thing and hasn't alcohol

(1:59:33) caused way more deaths than alcohol is controllable so alcohol is consuma controllable you can drink alcohol and

(1:59:40) not even get drunk or you can drink alcohol to the point of absurdity and get drunk to the point where you can't even control yourself I would say that

(1:59:46) that's bad you know what I mean but alcohol in and of itself the intake of it no that's not bad so Andrew so if

(1:59:52) shrooms could be controlled like we could control to the same degree as alcohol then you'll be okay with legalizing it no I still think that the

(1:59:59) it there could be a potentiality to the Mind where it opens you up to things that other other types of drugs like

(2:00:05) that don't the drug in and of itself if you're talking about like just taking a drug it's not even the addiction

(2:00:12) necessarily that is problematic or sinful the addiction itself is not what

(2:00:17) the what kind of the issue is it's because let's assume for a second like you can become addicted to a behavior

(2:00:24) like I have a friend who's a musician he could be become addicted to playing the guitar to the point where he falls away

(2:00:29) from God uh things like this also fall under those same purview right it's not

(2:00:35) that the addiction itself even um the vice is the problem but whether or not

(2:00:42) it's moving you away from the relationship with God and this is why you have spiritual fathers to help guide

(2:00:47) you through this because each indiv individual person how they uh interact with different drugs different things uh

(2:00:54) like this is going to be completely different there I could conceive for instance of a person I could say like

(2:01:00) cocaine's mostly morally bad but I can conceive of a person who maybe participates in an experiment to

(2:01:06) demonstrate the side effects of something like this um where I could say maybe it's not morally bad and that

(2:01:12) would kind of be at the discretion of their spiritual father I that makes sense I will ask one last followup question on this this is this

(2:01:18) interesting discussion think you and I should do a separate time would you say that alcohol for the vast majority of the time moves people especially

(2:01:24) drinking to excess moves people further away from God I think it definitely can but I

(2:01:29) don't even think that drinking to excess um you know sometimes does that necessarily I think that being an

(2:01:36) alcoholic does that I think that your priest would tell you to stop being a [ __ ] alcoholic because it's bad for

(2:01:41) you and it's and it takes you away so like let's say you're like non-alcoholic right like someone like me who doesn't

(2:01:46) drink but let's say I get really drunk I'm more more likely to engage in sinful behaviors I'm more likely to cheat I'm

(2:01:52) more likely to drink and drive I'm more likely to start a fight right like even for a non-alcoholic you wouldn't say that like getting drunk to like yeah you

(2:01:58) probably you probably shouldn't get drunk but on the other hand if you did get drunk and engage in none of those behaviors and you only did it every once

(2:02:05) in a while then who would give a [ __ ] right but then you could make the same argument about like psychedelics right

(2:02:10) because you if you did not like let's say it brought you closer to God like uh like you spend the whole day praying

(2:02:16) when you were on trooms like then that would be okay well the is author or I would adhere to the church's Authority

(2:02:22) on this and they say no that that's absolutely not the case and that is part of our religion is to adhere to church

(2:02:28) Authority every single plant that you engage in on planet Earth is going to have a different effect on you than other plants and these are things that

(2:02:35) have been around for an awful long time and it's not really at your discretion as to whether or not you can embibe uh

(2:02:41) these things you have that's why you have the church authority to help guide you okay I'm not going to do all the

(2:02:47) debate too much with this but this is an interesting discussion discussion I think we should yeah I'm happy to come back and have it uh okay so anyway let's

(2:02:53) go through the super chats really quick Alex you should ask my who did his hair [ __ ] plants because you need one

(2:02:58) forehead looking like a five I do appreciate people giving me money to criticize my hair feel give me all the money you want if you give me a 50 you

(2:03:04) can criticize whatever you want I don't care uh okay anyway I'm not gonna read any super disrespectful

(2:03:11) uh uh comments just a heads up in regardless of the money amount Andrew Divine theory has been defeated by EO

(2:03:17) Dilma something's good only because God said good then your morality is arbitrary will condemn God when he okay

(2:03:22) I I'm kind of lost by this question but maybe this ufro dilemma is are things good you it's uh I think it's Plato are

(2:03:29) things good because God says so or God are are does God command things because they're good it's like it's a it's one

(2:03:35) of the uh like fallacies of religion and God but I mean so yeah so Andrew do you

(2:03:42) have like an answer yeah so I'm happy to uh dive into that but the explanation is going to take an awful long time but if

(2:03:48) you want to hop in the Discord have that conversation something like this there's actually no fallacy pre uh present but

(2:03:55) I'm happy to do so okay uh Andrew what is your moral ought why egalitarianism

(2:04:01) is bad for society well it's not in it as far as a moral a goes it's not even a

(2:04:07) moral a it literally doesn't and cannot even exist it can't even exist

(2:04:13) egalitarianism is a it's a it's a hoax it's uh it's not even possible to have

(2:04:19) it's some madeup [ __ ] then I think question questions not for Jasmine

(2:04:27) okay so anyway uh I don't even think that it exists I don't even think so

(2:04:32) when you ask me the question it's somewhat incoherent right because you're asking me to make an a claim against something that I don't even think is

(2:04:38) descriptive reality right I don't even know how to engage with it okay uh ask

(2:04:45) Andrew why every society that gives wom rights is forcing is forcing while those

(2:04:50) that don't is not and if I'm wrong at the point the country is ideal uh I'm a

(2:04:56) little do you understand the question I I think so hang on let me

(2:05:01) reread it why every society that gives women rights is forcing and those who

(2:05:06) don't is not he qualified okay he he uh ask Andrew why every society gives wom

(2:05:12) rights has flourished while everyone that has not has been struggling and what is his ideal country okay there we

(2:05:17) go They're not they're not actually flourishing so in fact the Nations which gave women rights are not even able to

(2:05:25) sustain their own populations they have to bring in Mass migration from other nations to keep their population level

(2:05:32) even stable and where are they pulling from pulling from all those Nations those religious Nations that breed

(2:05:38) that's where they're pulling them from that's where they're getting all of those migrants to replace their population over x amount of time you're

(2:05:45) not even going to have the core groups left in any of these countries they're all going to be it's going to be

(2:05:51) completely disproportional and the re it actually has to go that way it has to go

(2:05:56) that way so no they're not flourishing there's an illusion based on technology

(2:06:02) due to technological advancement that there's some type of flourishment because women can be loud obnoxious

(2:06:07) [ __ ] on the internet but there is no actual flourishing going on in the west

(2:06:12) it's a decaying Society in fact where population collapse for many of these nations is imminent it's an eminent

(2:06:19) population collapse now that doesn't mean the population goes away overnight it just means that there is an eminent

(2:06:26) population collapse which is coming the age demographic which you need to subsidize the five generations after and

(2:06:31) the one before which is this key demographic of like 19 to 30 year olds it's disappearing so they can't do it so

(2:06:38) no I reject the premise I would say you can't flourish in a society that can't even sustain itself that seems like it's

(2:06:45) the opposite of flourishing what is your ideal country that's the second part of the question well my ideal country right now uh

(2:06:52) really doesn't exist I would say that what would be ideal would be something close to the ethical system of the

(2:06:59) Byzantine Empire though there were some problems with that as well but ultimately as the West collapse

(2:07:06) collapses and population collapses um the kind of societal properties that I'm talking about will become emergent

(2:07:13) because they're self-apparent they're literally self-apparent and and every single nation from the round up they'll

(2:07:19) always start and fixate under a patriarchal system because they must in order to survive and then over time when

(2:07:26) egalitarianism seeps in and these sorts of wild ideas seep in for equality

(2:07:31) that's when you actually start to see this kind of decadence and Decay and then over time they collapse they always

(2:07:36) collapse so if you have to pick one country right now that you think is really like I I understand none of them

(2:07:41) are perfect but the one that you think out of all the ones is the best which one would you pick I would look at the

(2:07:47) Eastern block uh the Old Eastern block Nations for better uh kind of moral

(2:07:53) prescriptions to this but they're not but they're not perfect by by any metric

(2:07:59) because they were under the Yoke of the Communists so they did move back to kind of their traditional settings that's

(2:08:05) true but because they were so ravaged by communism many of their nations are still in a state of disarray 30 40 years

(2:08:12) behind in many cases so I do think that some of those countries though do have

(2:08:17) prescriptions are at least beginning to work on their birth rate issues and they are beginning to push those up so I just

(2:08:22) think that from a moral standpoint uh this would work fine inside of the United States but there has to be some

(2:08:29) kind of incentive and push to reproduce your population or you're not going to have a population right that's just the

(2:08:36) way it is it's just basic math right okay I have so many followup questions but I want to Der rail so we'll just move on to the next Super Chat the

(2:08:42) winner in still undefeated for the heavyweight debate Champions Andrew Wilson we actually did a poll and came out pretty close uh pan thought some

(2:08:48) yeah who won the poll you won by about 8% yeah this is your audience no it's

(2:08:54) not my audience it's my yeah but you're you're also in like the hate they hate

(2:09:00) me they that's not true my audience has a weird crush on you no Jasmine out of

(2:09:05) all the people who debated Andrew and I've done poll you've done the best I believe aside from maybe Destiny so uh

(2:09:11) yeah panel thoughts onal liberalism it refused the feminist ideals that encourage authoritarian use of State

(2:09:16) enforce differences of sex is currently which mogyy all right let's start off with I guess Jasmine what are your thoughts

(2:09:22) on Paleo libertarianism I I don't even I've never heard of that so never heard that either

(2:09:29) let me Google it [Music] libertarianism I think I've heard this

(2:09:35) ter before okay uh is a Libertarian political activism strategy aimed at

(2:09:41) uniting Libertarians and pal conservatives okay so it's like anti-war it's like anti- neocon it's like

(2:09:47) isolationism basically type of uh where you can basically do like what you want as long as it doesn't hurt other people

(2:09:53) like drugs would be legal uh you know like uh there would be no uh involvement

(2:09:58) in Wars unless we were directly attacked that would be kind of I think that's the gist of it the opposite of like neocons so what my question is what do I

(2:10:05) think of that yeah uh I think like broadly speaking it sound but like I

(2:10:11) think when you get into the intricacies and the details like I mean running a society is difficult especially with

(2:10:17) this many people so it's cool to say oh yeah just legalize everything and just be free but obviously sometimes the

(2:10:23) consequences that come out of that do require us to Pivot and U make the

(2:10:28) decisions that we think is best for the well-being of society I don't know what else to really say about that okay Andrew what's your take on that I'm

(2:10:34) sorry can you repeat the question one more time for me I'm sorry the thoughts on Paleo uh

(2:10:40) libertarianism oh it refutes feminist ideals that encourage authoritarian so I paleo libertarianism though is something

(2:10:48) of a contradiction because in a stateless society the the whole goal of Libertarians supposed to be the the

(2:10:54) tales end coin to the goal of communist which is a stateless society which means no enforcement so if you're kind of

(2:11:01) moving into the opposition of enforcement and paleo conservatism would say no we need to embrace enforcement in

(2:11:07) order to have a stable Society Society what is actually paleo about it what do you moving back to as far as

(2:11:14) libertarianism goes because that's never been sucessfully implemented anywhere

(2:11:20) even on the islands where they say that it has been it really hasn't been there's still always a mechanism of state enforcement so I don't think it's

(2:11:26) a good idea though it's a good reputation of feminism it's not a good solid core base idea on its own I don't

(2:11:33) think uh my quick thoughts is I tend to lean more libertarian but I I'm not a big fan of like the hardcore Anarchist

(2:11:39) libertarian where it's like oh bro everything will take care of itself like the government should basically be as small as possible I think the government

(2:11:45) is necessary for certain things you need the government to come in and you know uh enforce for example safety regular can't have companies putting whatever

(2:11:52) they want in like [ __ ] right and selling it to you and lying to you about it which we had that in the 1800s like they would just sell medicines that would

(2:11:57) kill people and all that so you do need some regulation the free market doesn't take care of everything but uh when it comes to social things are tend toally

(2:12:04) more libertarian anyway here's one last and question this is actually interesting one is alcohol or only fan social media more damaging to women

(2:12:09) today I guess it's a question for both of you um I more damaging to women today uh

(2:12:19) I I I do think that social media I don't like only fans SL social media because I

(2:12:24) don't think they're like one and the same and when you do like a like so I would say social media there is good

(2:12:29) evidence that um especially when people spend a lot of time on it that it's bad for you now I think both of these things

(2:12:35) are okay in moderation um it's only when it becomes a problem which both of them can definitely be a problem but I would

(2:12:41) say more people are negatively affected by spending too much time on social media than women have a problem with

(2:12:47) alcoholism I think Men actually generally have more of a problem with alcoholism than women do okay Andrew

(2:12:53) only fans okay not just only fans by itself but it's a it's a curtailing into

(2:13:00) or not a curtailing but a movement into kind of a greater degenerate society in

(2:13:06) which uh we're kind of viewing things as a meat market and we're viewing kind of

(2:13:12) this independent uh goal of do as thou Wilt as being some sort of high value

(2:13:17) the there's nothing high value about only fans there's nothing virtuous about only fans there's nothing virtuous about

(2:13:23) prostitution there's nothing virtuous about any of these things and there never has been and always everybody in

(2:13:29) life that you meet who you say that to if you say to them you're a prostitute or you say to them that you're involved

(2:13:35) in only fans which I consider to be just basically a form of prostitution I don't think most people would disagree with that assessment but that's basically

(2:13:41) what it is um instantly are going to see you as a virtess person and I don't

(2:13:48) really blame them it seems reasonable to me to assume that a person who engages

(2:13:53) in those activities has low virtue so I think that in if the entire Society was

(2:14:00) all alcoholics everybody in society was Alcoholics it was like Ireland right I'm kidding kidding but even if it was I

(2:14:06) still think it would be less detrimental to society as a whole than the mass porn

(2:14:11) industry and what it's done to the relationship Dynamics between people

(2:14:17) okay uh uh anyway so we're going on two hours and 15 minutes uh initially the plan was to do Callins but I don't

(2:14:22) really think we're GNA have enough time for that uh as you guys know I go to make it a Whole Foods before they close

(2:14:28) so let's do I guess I want to thank both of you guys for coming on uh let's do I guess you guys can both plug your

(2:14:33) channels and whatever it is that you want to promote so uh yeah Jasmine do what do you wanna do you wna tell people

(2:14:39) I guess where they can find you yeah well uh to in this free degenerate

(2:14:44) Society you guys should uh subscribe to my only fans you guys can go go to Jasmine Jafar me and that has all my

(2:14:51) socials my only fans is Jasmine 0000 JZ Meen 0000 well I will continue to do

(2:14:56) what I like to do um and luckily he's he's right that a lot of people don't like only fans and they have uh they

(2:15:03) have assumptions and they have negative attitudes towards only fans but I think just as many people of not more have negative attitudes to like his ideology

(2:15:09) so I'm pretty happy with the way things are sitting I'm okay I'm not worried about anything like that so yeah come

(2:15:15) follow me cool Andrew where can you to find your only

(2:15:21) fans uh well you'll never be able to find my only fans because I'm not a [ __ ] degenerate but you can find me
