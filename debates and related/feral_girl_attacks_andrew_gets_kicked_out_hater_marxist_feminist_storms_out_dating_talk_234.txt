(10:58) Brian Atlas again he put on uh put together a huge swath of debates for us

(11:03) so let's make sure we support this channel speaking of way changer uh we

(11:09) have I think three four shows I must report unfortunate news to you Andrew

(11:16) for tomorrow the uh individual in question coward because she saw your

(11:22) debate with Kenzie and she knew she didn't say this but I knew that she saw your prowess

(11:30) and she pulled out claiming that she did not want to debate you because despite the debate being incredibly

(11:37) respectful uh and very long too and for it to maintain that level of respect for

(11:43) so long uh I'm surprised that she she just said you were just too

(11:51) much which is why admitting you you rape your wife as oh my God bro did you not

(11:56) grae are you really going to just do this oh sorry you do Tik Tok streams hello I know I'm sorry we went over it

() 

(12:04) yesterday we went over it before the show today so I think and also that's like incredibly like a total buzz kill

(12:11) thing to say at the be beginning of the stream like to say hold on hold on hold

(12:16) on sure go ahead so we have other panelists here I think it's incredibly disingenuous to to just say that he

(12:23) grapes his wife he without without providing the

(12:29) the Fuller context of that conversation mind you mind you you must have missed

(12:34) the part where Rachel was continuously chiming in through the show where she has consent she's consented to like she

(12:42) wakes him up with certain acts he wakes her up with C AE you want to you want to

(12:48) insert you want to insert a buzzword to try to paint this man as a [ __ ]

(12:53) predator and a criminal and I think that's absolutely despicable especially at the start of a [ __ ] dating

(12:59) discussion show I'd like you to apologize to Andrew I apologize for my language no

(13:05) it's not your language I want I want you to apologize for your mischaracterization because

(13:11) categorically that's not what he is did he not say categorically that's what he is but here's the thing saw and I don't

(13:18) think you were graping your wife now well no right so so this is the problem is like you can just definitionally so

(13:25) women named Kinsey who drink water are Grapist by that definition aren't you a Grapist yes right so that's what you do

(13:32) you use you definitionally will say oh oh you and every other normal American

(13:38) married couple on planet Earth will often times wake each other up with sex it's grape it's like it's the most

(13:45) ridiculous thing anybody's ever they were laughing at you because it's so ridiculous I don't think it's ridiculous

(13:50) that one aspect of engaging with someone when you're having sex is that they're conscious oh anybody anybody here I mean

(13:59) ever ever Hadid ever been in a couple relationship where one of you woke the other one up with sex

(14:05) anyone no just me and you that's it I ask I ask it's good to make sure you're

(14:13) like if you're married to the other person or you do that but why why do you want them to be unconscious I mean I

(14:18) don't like I you know my wake I'm not literally I don't have the you know

(14:23) device that puts it in but I like you know wake them up in ways to suggest

(14:30) that I want it and then you suggest that you want it or you actually are like

(14:36) forcing penetration while they unconscious I'm not doing that I'm not doing that that'd be pretty hard I mean

(14:42) you would have to have a lot of intent to seems like she walked it back uh no I mean most people in most people in those

(14:51) situations there's like groping and stuff they don't usually put it straight

(14:56) on in when they I don't know how to explain it thinking so so wait they just

(15:02) they only saay you while you're asleep then they don't they don't if it's in

(15:07) her definition are they just grabbing a boo are they justb you can't like I

(15:14) don't personally my boundaries in a relationship I'm okay with that if someone is not okay with that then it is

(15:21) essay and grape you know so I'll explain it like this I guess really simply if

(15:26) you have given consent to your girlfriend hey babe would I would like you to and I

(15:32) will allow you to wake me up with a BJ her position is that that woman has just

(15:38) now committed a felony would you guys agree that she

(15:43) should be then arrested and placed I mean she doesn't believe in prison should she then be placed in prison my a

(15:50) girlfriend you your boyfriend says hey babe I'd like you to wake me up with a BJ you fully have my consent she thinks

(15:56) that that's sa she think that that's a felony I I don't agree with that the I

(16:05) see where she's coming from like how are you serious no I'm not saying I can see

(16:11) what she's trying to say like she would want like her partner to be awake or her be awake before like having sex well

(16:18) that's fine if that's her standard for her relationship do you think consent should be reversible but it's it's it's

(16:25) not rap if they say no and they keep going that is so you're saying if I tell

(16:30) my girlfriend I'm just asking do you think aspect of consent is that it's reversible are you saying that if I how

(16:37) can you reverse it if you're unconscious if he's doing it and you wake up and you don't want to then just be like I don't feel like it and have them stuck it's

(16:43) that simple imagine like imagine you wake up and your boyfriend is having sex with you I I don't think it starts wake

(16:51) up that for feel I don't have to imagine it I do it all very violating he has been I don't

(16:59) think you would sleep through that unless why why do you

(17:04) conveniently omit and exclude the portion where there has been uh consent

(17:10) given why why are you not answering my question how you answer my question to consense be revocable H I know I don't

(17:17) have the mute button like you do on your [ __ ] Tik toks but I'm the host so you're going to answer my question go

(17:23) ahead so in the same way that you bully people in your Tik toks you're going to answer my question go ahead answering

(17:29) your question usually when you ask a question you stop talking so someone can answer it go ahead great so when we look

() 

(17:34) at aspects of consent I don't think it's just based on being agreeing to an action there are other aspects of

(17:41) consent when it comes to sex and one of it is that consent is reversible if you're unconscious you can't reverse

(17:48) your consent what about a will what about will yeah a will can somebody will

(17:54) you their stuff yes I don't understand they're not conscious what about their we're talking

(18:00) we're talking about consent when it comes to sex obviously there are going to be different standards when it comes to uh different aspects that you're

(18:07) agreeing to like even medical procedures require an aspect of informed consent uh

(18:13) sex different aspect contracts have different aspects how do you give somebody the ability to make medical

(18:18) decisions for you uh I mean if you're a power of attorney yeah so then you're

(18:24) agreeing that this person when you're not conscious can do things with your body

(18:29) sure why can't you do that with your when it comes to sex when it comes to medical procedures yes why can't you do

(18:35) that when it comes to sex uh because I just believe that you have to have that aspect of it being reversible totally

(18:41) inconsistent how is it that a person can be unconscious on a table again there are different standards when it comes to

(18:47) different aspects well I know that there's different standards but in order to be consistent if the one standard is there no yeah yeah if the one standard

(18:54) is there it doesn't have to be consistent standards for every single situ so you just have inconsistent

(19:00) standards that's what you're saying well yes I do think sex has certain conditions that should be uh should be

(19:06) required I don't I don't he just think so being reversible is is unreasonable

(19:11) or being conscious is reversible would be she wakes up after she gave you consent and then says stop that would be

(19:17) reversible consent well she's not conscious she doesn't have the capacity to reverse she already gave you the

(19:22) consent you're going to wake up during sex unless you're on drugs or something noises oh my God imagine if you're

(19:30) having sex while you're drunk and then you pass out in the middle is there is there any kind of continuing to go

(19:37) likeing no yeah being unconscious like after keep going that' be weird well I

(19:42) mean you already got consent that's different that's like a

(19:48) whole different like scenario like if you're being woken up it's not and you already gotten consent I just don't know

(19:55) why it's such a crazy take that when you're having sex with partner that they're conscious because because it's

(20:02) being drunk being like too drunk and you passed out that's just different from like well let me ask you this she's

(20:07) asleep and you reach over when you're spooning her and you just grab a handful of the chest is that essay no why not I

(20:15) think when we're talking about essay within this specific context like she can't content she talking the one act of

(20:22) putting something in while the other person is unconscious again this is totally incist I think there can be

(20:28) different is between like unwanted touches or unwanted affection versus um

(20:33) engaging in sex when when your partner's UNC I understand doesn't a woman need to consent before I grab her

(20:39) chest uh no I I think there can be uh when you're in a committed relationship

(20:45) I do think that there can be aspects of like understanding each other just not that one not not when it comes to like

(20:51) bodily Integrity cuddling and having sex is different I understand that they're

(20:56) different but why is the standard different so that the whole idea here is consent because the degree do you think someone being groped and someone being

(21:03) graped are equal in ter do you think from an intersectional Viewpoint that all traumas and I'm answering it from an

(21:08) intersectional Viewpoint all traumas are not equal since all traumas are not equal a poor woman who's getting her chest grabbed can be just as traumatized

(21:15) as a woman who's been penetrated yeah um I mean obviously it would depend on the person but no I would say if you

(21:21) are um penetrated that that violation of bodily Integrity is always going you can't make a determination from

(21:28) intersectional standpoint on trauma trauma for a woman who's been groped can be just as bad as a woman who has been

(21:35) penetrated yes or no no I would always say the trauma from being penetrated is going to be based on what just some

(21:41) arbitrary standard you made up just because well just because of how different your body is um in terms of

() 

(21:50) being violated internally versus touched oh I see so there's lifelong damage

(21:55) there's not a single woman who's who's been penetrated who's had Lessa trauma than a woman who

(22:01) has been making the claim I'm asking answer how can I I don't

(22:07) understand what claim did I make you made the claim that everyone's trauma is going to I said from an intersectional

(22:12) standpoint someone well that again that's that's your yes from an intersectional standpoint it's literally

(22:18) in intersectional literature that trauma that trauma cannot be deduced as feminist standpoint Theory where you can

(22:25) find it in every university in the United States that teaches feminist classes so in feminist standpoint Theory

(22:31) the claim is made that trauma you cannot say one trauma is worse than another

(22:36) trauma how could you do intersectionality if you if you believe that you could just do that arbitrarily

(22:41) you can't so if that's the case you can't really make the claim this trauma is worse than that trauma because it's

(22:47) going to be dependent on the person going be a higher degree depending on the person

(22:52) yeah I I think there can be obvious classifications okay but depending on the person logically this has to follow

(23:00) it has to be dependent on the person one trauma can be worse for them or it can be less worse for them yes or no no okay

(23:08) well then then that's compl non I've said the same thing over and over okay

(23:13) so then uh you're telling me that a like let's say a white person he grows up in

(23:19) like horribly povertous conditions in the South okay and there's a black person who grows up and they have kind

(23:26) of a nice middle class lifestyle right uh do you think that if that black

(23:32) person is called the nword and that Southerner is called the seword even though clearly objectively that white

(23:38) person has a worse standard of living than the black person that that's more or less hurtful for one or the other

(23:44) what's the word we can't don't say it oh my God yeah I can't say it I don't know

(23:49) what the c word is I'm just wondering cuz everyone knows what the N word more hurt I'm just wondering obviously the N

(23:54) word is going to be worse based on what based on the generation and hisor how could that be worse on the guy who's

(24:01) middle class though hey whoa whoa whoa whoa hold on hold on hey hey

(24:08) hey did you forget the part of the conversation where only one person should be speaking at a time she's

(24:15) speaking granted she's talking way too much than she should be at this point in the conversation we haven't even gone

(24:21) through the intros which she well not really it's her bad uh if people are engaged in the conversation you guys

(24:28) can't be interrupting other people can I ask yeah I just want to

(24:34) say both of you guys it makes sense like if you're in a new relationship you're

(24:39) not going to go and and and and put anything anywhere it doesn't belong and

(24:45) if you're in a married relationship and you guys both have talked to one another about what is appropriate in your

(24:52) relationship and you've already decided what your boundaries are then that seems

(24:57) acceptable right stop using logic in reason stop that it's this is a Marxist

(25:02) we're talking to you don't need logic you don't need reason say one time I did fall asleep while doing that right I

(25:11) like I I was drunk and then yeah I fell asleep but why would he see I want to

(25:17) know what part of it do you like do you like the part right like when she doesn't feel it at

(25:25) all Robert Tanner donated 1 ,000 pop champagne hey here is your champagne pop

() 

(25:34) hoping this help you out Andrew and Brian message me anytime for help all yo

(25:40) Robert Tanner really good to see you uh in the chat man I do appreciate the champagne um can you uh bring just the

(25:45) cups and the champagne ball that was

(25:52) Qui just give me the whole bag and I'll figure it out I'm actually denying you and you champagne

(25:59) wait what why denied champagne uh because you're prone to Interruption and

(26:05) if you get liquored up you're just going to interrupt a whole bunch you were interrupting you're not getting champagne either um well I was reacting

(26:12) to her well you know sometimes Collateral Damage I don't know what to say oh man okay I like this I like the

(26:19) panel it's like a panel thing right like where each of us get to kind of chime in

(26:26) because that's the well that's what I would like before she hijacked the uh the conversation there rather rudely um

(26:32) two girls are trying to talk so may like only one person should be talking at a time regardless of their gender how

(26:38) about that all right yeah why don't you listen to that huh yeah regardless of their

(26:45) gender and regardless of their wait when they were having an exchange how about

(26:51) do you think I'm going to say anything I'm not I'm not getting champagne so I have no incentive so participating in

(26:57) good faith in the conversation when this is your second time on the show I've already went over the rules with you multiple times you were interrupting

(27:04) Kenzie when she was speaking you were interrupting them while they in the midst of conversation you uh you you

(27:10) reeled her into your disruption too I said can I add and no no no oh no no no I'm not

(27:17) going to let you get away with that you you said can I add after I told you to be quiet and stop interrupting people he

(27:24) said sure yeah he did he are you guys actually gaslighting right now so there

(27:29) was they were talking then they started having a sidebar conversation after I

() 

(27:35) justly told her to be quiet and let Kenzie finish talking then she said can

(27:40) I add something and then he said sure right my issue isn't with that my issue

(27:46) is with the initial Interruption are you are you not following did you just repeated yourself would you like me to

(27:52) repeat myself now do you need me to explain it to you again let me get you caught up one more time I don't have

(27:58) objection to her having done a subsequent oh I want to do a follow-up question pertaining to the topic way

(28:04) more der she's interrup derailing the whole thing you know what I'm the host of the show I will talk as much as I'd

(28:10) like pertaining to your Interruption and I'm a guest of your show thank you for having me on do you need to be kicked

(28:16) off already is that what's going on better sooner than later Brian God damn bro

(28:24) mhm it's like [ __ ] dealing with uh think strong

(28:31) women is that what you think being strong is is just being obnoxious is that how do you define strong how do you

(28:36) describe power do you think having power is just paying a bunch of women to hang out with you for several

(28:45) hours yes how into the microphone yes yeah I'm

(28:50) not trust me I Ain paying you I ain't paying y'all first off I ain't paying y'all to hang out with me we're here

(28:57) doing a podcast so I don't know where you're getting that from can I respond

(29:03) to you Lord Brian huh um may I please respond Master Brian making sure she don't interr we

(29:11) passing to I don't know over here do do you want some I don't want

(29:17) any no can I have hers please

(29:22) I'll I don't think I'm do you want some yes please do you

(29:28) want some don't drink if we're also if we're talking about sa and women are

(29:33) most we are the victims mostly of sa so obviously we're all going to have

(29:39) different things to add so that you can hear our voices because that's why we're here right so that we can give you the

(29:45) female perspective I'm not again I'm not going to allow

(29:51) you in time out I'll thank you I'm not going to allow you to m misar

(29:59) what happened she was talking then you two were engaged in what we call a

(30:04) sidebar conversation which we specifically tell you not to do what do both of you not understand

(30:12) about how to engage in a conversation answer me that now riddle me this

(30:19) Batman if you if you were actually talking to us not like on this podcast

() 

(30:27) is that how you would speak to me cuz I don't think so how how would that matter

(30:33) how would that matter what if I talk to you exactly how you talk to me oh do you

(30:39) always talk the same way in a job occupation that you would outside job occupation I understand entertaining

(30:45) well it's not just entertainment but there's a there's something to be said of your mic down please degrading just a meaning well

(30:53) that's that's kind of funny like I had a a shop foreman who was just like the nicest guy you could ever imagine when

(31:00) we were outside of the shop and when he was inside the shop he would throw tools at me all the time literally throw them

(31:05) at my head I'm sorry that happened to you oh was great he was like one of the best ever right sounds traumatic but

(31:11) inside of his occupation right of course he acts in the capacity of his

(31:16) occupation that's how it works don't you act a certain way in

(31:22) your occupation Pleasant yeah well I mean that's that's good that you've only

(31:27) ever had Pleasant occupied jobs right but not all of us have some jobs require a different form

(31:34) of discourse can I ask you a question if somebody murdered your family and you saw the murderer standing right there

(31:39) would you be pleasant like verbally to the murderer that's why you have such contempt for women because you think of

(31:46) them as murderers your analogies sometimes they

(31:52) never do you know what an analogy is that's a complete logical failing on your part answer the actual question

(31:59) I'm trying to understand where this is coming from why don't you just answer the question because I'll explain it to

(32:05) you you asked me you asked me about my tone I will explain my tone to you if you answer my

(32:12) question can I say something no let her

(32:17) answer if I saw a murderer if someone murdered my family and they were right

(32:22) there what how would I react yeah would you be pleasant towards them verbally

(32:27) would you be like oh can I get you like a glass of water or would you yell at them like would you treat them

(32:37) politely I'll explain it to you as just as soon as I am trying to understand but I I'll I'll make you understand but I'd

(32:44) like you to answer the question first I would not have anything to do with him so they don't need to breathe the air

(32:50) that I'm like we don't need to be around one another when you go okay so you you

(32:56) wouldn't be like [ __ ] you I hate you maybe I'm going to murder you

(33:06) back yeah yeah would have you ever been in

(33:11) argument with somebody yeah have you ever raised your voice at somebody or you're just what never once in your life

(33:19) somebody has upset you or done something which you determined or you viewed as wrong or a uh a sort of grievance and

(33:28) you've just always remained 100% tactful and you never got upset and your voice

(33:33) was always perfectly calm no no you've yelled have you yelled at somebody before yeah what did they do

(33:39) were they wrong maybe you were Justified to yell at them is that fair to say did somebody hurt like did somebody ever do

(33:45) something harmful or hurtful to you I felt very very bad about it you felt bad

(33:50) and Have You Ever Raised your voice at anybody yeah that's what I felt bad about you felt bad about your own

(33:56) raising your own voice yes have you ever been involved in

(34:02) like I don't know how better to for me to get angry at someone has anyone ever treaded on you in some way yes it's

(34:10) really weird it's like cuz I can see you you use cutting wit to cut people down

(34:15) right do you feel bad about that I do not cut people down are you sure I'm

(34:21) sure well then what was the quip at Brian but he just paid women to hang out with you that wasn't a cutting quip was

(34:26) it yeah but imagine being having all of the leverage used against you I see so

(34:32) what you're saying then is that you do have a defense mechanism that you're use perhaps you don't perhaps you don't raise your voice but you'll use the

(34:39) defense mechanism you have of a cutting quip right do you feel bad about that well it usually makes people laugh

(34:45) sometimes sure it's like a positive unless but what if it hurt Brian's feelings like that would that make me feel bad yeah well then you should feel

(34:52) bad Brian he looks like he got his feelings you should you should definitely feel bad he didn't get his feelings hurt who are you to dictate

(34:58) yeah now you can dictate you have your feelings are your feelings hurt are my feelings hurt I mean by uh

(35:05) you're your position is a one of misrepresentation that's clearly you represent yourself just fine are are

(35:12) your feelings hurt uh huh are you feelings hurt I think it's unfair to misrepresent

(35:17) somebody I I'm sorry I still don't know if they're hurt or not how does that

(35:23) pertain well that's the question that's what she's asking is whether someone 's feelings are hurt or not can you tread

(35:30) on somebody like if you know maybe their feelings aren't hurt but you have grieved them in some way but their

(35:36) feelings aren't hurt okay but she's asking if your feelings are HT yeah we can maybe let her speak for herself on

(35:42) This I Know The Sisterhood wants to come in and defend her but I'm talking to her now I'm not defending her that's cool I

(35:47) want to know what the murderer thing meant like where did that come he's just showing different behavior in different

(35:54) contexts like thing ex could upset you and you would rebeh differently if thing

(35:59) X if you're dealing with thing X that's it so this is just I guess what I'm trying to get out here hey uh can we can

(36:05) we get people in frame here so I think on the sources tab you can change the split so scroll down and then it's the

(36:11) top one they're so mean here show it's the other one it's the g5r see but this is I you just said I mean this is sort

(36:18) of the lack of self-awareness and lack of accountability that a lot of people have and it seems like there is a trend

() 

(36:25) more so when it comes to women having a lack of account ability you're just saying essentially what you're saying is

(36:30) Brian you are so rude and so mean and you raise your voice for no reason and it's just it completely manifests out of

(36:37) nowhere out of The Ether however I would like to before I actually for the

(36:44) position that you just completely lack accountability do you think the fact that I have uh been a bit Stern with you

(36:52) do you think that you have contributed or done nothing wrong

(36:58) I would say that it's not like it's coming out of the ether but I would say

(37:04) something within yourself and that it's actually you sure people people can have like internally like be short short

(37:11) tempered right or they can like be lose their patience especially if they've uh

(37:16) their patience has been dwindled time and time again I agree with you I'll ask the question again though since you

(37:22) continue to duck it what do you think you did to contribute

(37:28) or did you do nothing wrong that could be your answer you think you did nothing wrong okay what do steal man my position

(37:36) what do you think I think you did wrong whether you think I'm wrong or

(37:42) not you don't you don't know it's just nothing there's just nothing there what do you think I think you did wrong how

(37:49) about that we'll start there I don't know I'm a [ __ ] idiot I don't know Brian I just please tell me what I think

(37:55) actually can you please just tell me what I think I wish I how thought you just

(38:02) engage in good faith and answer the question what if you talk to me with respect how about you conduct with your

(38:08) respect begets respect you need to respect me first

(38:13) exactly did she just say exactly that she needs to respect me first so you were being disrespectful me or you you

(38:20) like how I came in I was polite I'm nice and then I feel like you emotionally

(38:28) explode well why don't you tilt your mic down once again please go ahead Andrew well so this is kind of funny right so

(38:35) do do you do you you have people I'm I'm assuming who are close personal friends of

(38:40) yours you have people who are close personal friends with you do I would

(38:46) yeah sure yeah yeah sure would you be necess or would you be upset if you're

(38:51) sitting at a table and somebody called them a Grapist in front of thousands of people

(38:58) okay hang on I just want hang on I just want to you to answer the direct question I'm asking would you would that

(39:03) upset you yes okay got it so then if you were addressing that and somebody cut in wouldn't it piss you

(39:14) off do you actually want me to answer is just rhetorical no it's a direct

(39:19) question I'm not being loud or this is a panel discussion and I

(39:26) heard as a being discussed I'm a woman and I think okay I have something to say

(39:32) about this totally agree with your recap and also I want to say that I was just going to add so that the conversation

(39:39) could be over I understand because it was way too long I understand that I don't even but hang on but I understand

(39:44) the recap well hang on I understand the recap wrong but the thing but the thing is like even if that recap is true I

(39:51) just would like you to answer me if somebody cut in right when that exchange

(39:56) was going on when somebody called a close personal friend of yours a Grapist wouldn't that piss you off no no okay I

(40:03) think most reasonable people would piss him off but okay you would have to think what are their intentions are they

(40:09) trying to diffuse the situation maybe we're all on a show here I I'll make it I'll I'm going to have to move it on I'm

(40:16) going to ask one I guess final thing on this and the whole panel is going to have to weigh in on this did before the

(40:23) show when Blake there was giving the pre-show instructions did he say the following thing one person speaking at a

(40:29) time don't interrupt no sidebar conversations which is leaning over to the person next to you and speaking to

(40:36) them did he say that yes yeah yes yes did he say that and you've been on the

(40:41) show multiple times I heard him say that but I'm saying I'm trying to understand

(40:48) how I I mean I I do see her point that maybe she thought there was a a time where she couldn't like he also said be

(40:55) aggressive make sure you just don't sit there I I think there can be a little Grace here no here's what happened is

(41:02) there was a moment after the initial uh confrontation that I had with her where

(41:07) she said now can I ask something but you guys are conveniently omitting or

(41:12) ignoring the part when when you were talking Kenzie they were talking they were I said what is the c

(41:20) word that is an important thing to talk about how could you ever say that oh

(41:26) which one's first the N word or a [ __ ] cracker okay I got to kick you off the show I told you I told you not

(48:42) Tanner thank you for the champagne Salo

(48:49) H so is that context for you or do you think she was completely justified in

(48:54) her conduct and behavior I no no I don't think she was justified but I and do you see what but you said context doesn't

(49:00) matter and you had a quarrel with me I have said context matter you you had a quarrel with me yesterday and we're not

(49:06) going to linger on this long that I had had to kick another girl out and you said what and then I called her a dgen

(49:14) and oh the context doesn't matter and that was wrong for Brian to do that that's not her her Contex was completely

(49:19) unacceptable I gave her multiple chances and she she uh was in contravention of

(49:26) multiple multiple of our rules she was interrupting I thought she was going to Grape me she actually technically that

(49:32) was a physical assault I don't think she that was pretty wild multiple women have tried on this show I did see it was

(49:41) technically an assault she didn't I don't think she battered you but her getting in your face like that you would

(49:47) have been well within your right to strike her back pain and damages Brian pineapple people and now pineapple

(49:54) pizza and now this Bri what else I supposed to deal with on this show yeah

(49:59) all right we're going to uh I forgot to take a sip of M

() 

(50:08) champagne uh cheers okay um I want I want The Sisterhood to defend her now go ahead

(50:15) Sisterhood defend her I have nothing to say about it I think it

(50:21) was she I don't know you gave her multiple chances and if she accidentally said the word whether she knew it or not

(50:26) all she had to do is apologize let it be but according to you or like it sounds like she knew what she was saying and

(50:32) that's the problem you gave them multiple chances and the rules were explained before the show and they were broken so well when she dove in with the

(50:39) F slur it was pretty much over and yeah when she intentionally maliciously uh

(50:44) yeah that's kind of uh we're going to do a couple adjustments here I think we're going to just scoot everybody down a

(50:50) chair uh so if you guys want to just scoot down one chair you can bring your drinks with you what if we did the other

(50:56) way she's in the corner hold on I got to go mute for a

(51:02) sec yeah okay then we're good uh speaking of which

() 

(52:14) champag thank you uh very needed thank you uh thank you man appreciate it uh

(52:19) thank you Robert Tanner guys can we get some W's in the chat for Robert Tanner here single-handedly uh supporting the show

(52:25) after that [ __ ] craziness uh you know what's funny though uh although I I want

(52:31) to thank Andrea over here halfway partially Andrea you were I suppose were

(52:36) somewhat helpful in assisting her to leave but uh it's interesting to me The

(52:43) Sisterhood on this it seems like a woman could do pretty much no wrong in situations like this and The Sisterhood

() 

(52:50) women will always have each other's backs as you were es escorting her out

(52:55) uh you said something along the lines of I understand I don't know that doesn't

(53:01) seem like a great thing to say to somebody who said like a homophobic slur and said a anti-white slur although

(53:08) given your position when it comes to white people maybe I'm not surprised that you cided with the person who

(53:14) dropped a slur against white people and a slur against gay people and did she also drop the n-word too she might have

(53:19) dropped I don't know if she did no she was referring to it we're not going to repeat all of them

(53:25) off she said that one I thought she no I did not say I agree with I understand

(53:33) about that I think there we go no I did not

(53:38) say I understand that she said that there I don't agree with what she said but I

(53:45) understand why she got upset cuz he was giving her attitude and it was just negative energy back and forth so I

(53:51) understand why it escalated but I don't understand like why she was saying that so don't say that I think the females

(53:59) were just trying to deescalate the situation and he was trying to escalate the situation [ __ ] no but I I apologize

(54:06) it didn't get caught on camera but I just popped it um go ahead no that wasn't the escalation this thing wasn't

(54:12) an escalation no I do that was I'm sorry what wasn't no she wasn't de escalating

(54:18) no no no who I was it no no the the gal who was here from the red girl was no

(54:24) she was I think you two were do an askc you later I'm saying after it went crazy

(54:29) the women W really sticking up for her they were trying to you heard me say oh I understand why you said all those

(54:35) slurs you you heard me say that no but you were you were being like oh I get it because they're jerks and blah blah blah

(54:40) you're like you're egging her on and you're basically telling her her contact was from a Grapist no I never said it's

(54:48) I never said it's acceptable I just want to say that my the statement I made is that you said you were a Grapist on our

(54:54) debate according to your logic though right but you're a Grapist I said well I

(55:00) could see maybe why she doesn't want to we're here you go we're not Rel Rel litigating that specific topic we're now

(55:07) go ahead finish your point okay let me let me go on um I don't agree that it escalated that way I don't agree that

(55:14) her actions should have got you know to that point but you know I do understand

(55:20) that like why it got to that point so we were just exchanging words do you

(55:25) understand why she walked over here and threatened Andrew with physical violence would you also like to do hold on the

(55:31) question's for her would you like to explain like how you understand that like for example let's say a woman is

(55:37) nagging and her husband's really frustrated by that and he just smacks her across the face would you say to him

(55:44) that you understand why he smacked her across the face go ahead no I wouldn't I

(55:49) wouldn't say that's I I wouldn't agree that a good idea why is no girl here like actually saying wow that's

(55:56) despicable that she went over here and got in his face and literally assaulted him no girl here it's the [ __ ]

(56:04) Sisterhood you guys I said I agree that she did that then she hear me say I don't agree that she did that I just

(56:10) said I don't agree with that I I tried to diffuse so that say there aister I've

(56:16) been laughing whole time my question for you to go if there was a a man who came

(56:22) across the table and got in a woman's face would you expect the men to get up and do something about that well I would

(56:28) Y strong Y strong I would but I want you to think about

(56:34) gender expect but think about think about the other direction right it's a lose lose for me so if a man gets in my

(56:41) face I can just knock him out well obviously I would if any guy got my face like that I would have just hit him but you know that she's smaller than you

(56:47) well not just that she's smaller than me but that there's going to be repercussions right because of the gendered expectation if I did do that

(56:54) right it gets in my face I can't really do anything anything except turn my head away or walk away to deescalate it right

(56:59) that's the only thing I can do I'm literally at your mercy where any of you

(57:05) could have stood up and been like get back right which is hang on which is exactly what hang on hang on hang on

(57:10) which is exactly what would be expected if it was a man because you'd be under physical duress I'm under a different

(57:15) kind of duress you're not under duress when you're going like this just saying trying to escalate the situation it

(57:22) wouldn't matter would it matter what woman did I'm pretty sure we what the woman did if the man was in his face

(57:28) yeah no both cases first of all ass something just pointing it out yeah

(57:35) I just want to add something cuz I just don't I don't want to be included in The Sisterhood of agreement with that

(57:41) behavior because I don't believe I don't agree with that at all I don't think anyone is agreeing with her behavior I

(57:46) don't really think so either I think that that was a good example of someone who lacks um behavioral regulation and

(57:54) emotional regulation by the way a fight with me I didn't pick a fight with her being ableist weren't you no she

(58:00) attacked me first but you could restrain from acting like that I think what they're say so how dare I defend myself

(58:08) I think aniz I think what the defending yourself literally just being like get

(58:14) away from me stop no no wait wait a second wait a second when somebody when somebody attacks you right you have two

(58:20) choices you can take it or you can tack back so someone comes at me and then just for example I'd be like oh shut

(58:26) shut your F that was go ahead she's interrupting you now go ahead so like if

(58:32) someone came to me and I'm they're yelling at me for me to defend myself I'm going to say like shut your fat ass

(58:38) up like I'm not defending myself I'm just you know attacking them back that's that is defense attacking people who

(58:44) attack you is defense I don't need to say that you know like I I don't need to say that I could have said something way completely different you could have sure

(58:50) does that give a right to to physically do something to but you defend you defend yourself with those kind of words is just going to escalate it more which

(58:57) you know it would well you don't here's the thing don't break it off don't tear

(59:02) it off if you can't handle it right so the thing is is like if you're going to get in someone's face should and like

(59:08) you hit them you should expect to get hit back if you're going to insult somebody you should expect to get insulted back but like um you can see

(59:14) how she's reacting already so you think oh let me add this on and it'll it'll make the situation better it's not going

(59:20) to make it better you know it's going to make it worse you know so you can't but then you're you're scared you're hang

(59:26) she's in charge of her behavor and if a man got in your face even if you were being obnoxious to him wouldn't you

(59:33) expect the men to do something about it yeah and and the reason why so it wouldn't even matter if you had escalated it you still I was I was going

(59:41) towards her more to you know deescalate the situation is because you're you're a man you're bigger than her you're

(59:46) stronger than her I don't need to defend you really because nothing's going to happen I'd rather stop her if I if I did

(59:53) if I physically did anything I'm the one who's going to get in trouble for it not her yeah because you're you're just

(1:00:00) you're stronger you don't need to oh she gets she's like yelling in my face a little bit I'm going to knock her out

(1:00:06) you don't need to do that yeah right but it's because of that if a man got in your face and somebody thought that's

(1:00:11) different yeah right it's different it's because you're you're way stronger we know what yes but do you understand that

(1:00:17) the consequences can be identical like police officers come in here beat the [ __ ] out of me drag my ass off to jail

(1:00:23) because a woman hit me and I hit her back right that's the commonality so we depend on women also to to push women

(1:00:31) back away cuz we can't we're not allowed to that's the societal structure I don't I don't know you know like a woman is

(1:00:37) not going to really hurt you unless she has like I mean they can they can a woman can't hurt a guy that she couldn't

(1:00:43) grab this bottle and hit me with it she was literally looking for things to hit me with that's what she was doing over

(1:00:48) there she was looking for [ __ ] to throw she was looking for things to hit people with yep and I will say Andrew I would have taken your side at that point I

(1:00:53) would have been the one to Defender so you didn't have to do nothing so I'm not a part of did in your face stood up to

(1:01:00) try and deescalate and I I I do I do want to say I do appreciate you walking away yeah if we if we weren't like

(1:01:07) protecting you no one would have got up so what wait if we wer weren't

() 

(1:01:13) protecting him against you guys were protecting him they got up yes you just said he was scared they tried to

(1:01:19) deescalate prot they protected standing up and saying don't

(1:01:26) is not protecting he was escalating he wasn't a victim in this he was like so I just want to make sure that if you were

(1:01:32) mouthing off if a guy if a guy called you an insult you called him an insult back what good is it going to do hang

(1:01:38) hang just let me ask a question someone hits you you hit them back man or woman I'm just asking the question that if a

(1:01:44) if a man was being insulting to you and then you insulted him back and then he walked over and got in your face pH and

(1:01:51) look like he's physically going to do something would you expect me and Brian to do something about that wait I you assulted me first I assulted

(1:01:58) you back and then this guy comes and gets in your face do you expect us to do something about that didn't the assault already happen assult not assault

(1:02:06) assault okay yeah so he comes he gets in your face do you expect us to do something about that didn't you say the

(1:02:12) assault already happened both parties sorry I'm not hearing prop yeah so he insults you insults and then you insult

(1:02:20) him back and then he comes and gets in your face do you expect me and Brian to do something about that yeah okay right

(1:02:27) so hang on if if you're doing this and laughing while she's there it doesn't

(1:02:32) seem like you want anybody to oh I see so if you right just kind of laughed at

(1:02:37) it what are Y what else are you going to do yeah yeah but at a guy you're just laughing you don't want us to do anything okay well if you were taking it

(1:02:44) seriously then maybe we would have taken it more seriously yeah you could tell when a woman is scared when a man is

(1:02:50) trying to flirt with her or be aggressive you seem back on scared I was laughing

(1:02:57) because it was like you know like why would first of all I can't get over there but they did get up once she was

(1:03:02) threatening you that was nice of them I mean I didn't want to like start

(1:03:09) physically restraining anybody um like I said I like I said you know I

(1:03:16) I do appreciate you walking away as an attempt to diffuse the situation cuz that was the ultimate

(1:03:21) goal yeah that was uh I don't know if we did a sal sal cheers to Robert Tanner

(1:03:29) for the um thank you uh cheers to Robert Tanner for the you know what we'll uh

(1:03:35) can I have that one yeah that's for you sry cheers to Robert Tanner Salo thank you sorry for the delay I'm going to let

(1:03:56) consent to graping the other person same action difference is her arbitrary consent presupposition

()

(1:04:26) the facade of false intelligence word you can respond I mean

(1:04:32) I don't know thank you I think that was chair two oh I think said one oh oh

(1:04:37) there is a dimensioned chair one yes he liked her uh let's see here we have

(1:04:43) Jason coming in Jason

(1:04:48) $200 well that was entertaining this is what feminism has done to women I hope

(1:04:54) all you feminists out there are happy I say appeal the 19th and women should only speak when spoken

(1:05:01) to yeah look I I'll just finish it on this and then we'll actually get into the show um look before the show we went

(1:05:09) over some roles um she's been on the show well she was on the show last week

(1:05:16) and then she's been on the show before sometimes I I give a bit more leeway to people who are new to the show

(1:05:22) she's been on the show she's heard those instructions that were given to her at least two other times three other times

(1:05:29) something like that you can't it's just general you don't interrupt it's rude to the person who's speaking she was

(1:05:35) interrupting she was doing sidebar conversations I was trying the reason I was trying to like get her to actually

(1:05:41) be like hey tell me what you did wrong is so that we could have a smooth stream and carry on with the stream and so she

(1:05:47) could stop doing that because if I didn't get her to actually make a concession that she was interrupting

(1:05:52) then she would just continue to be acting in the way that she was not prepared to take any accountability for

(1:05:58) I can't have a productive stream if people are interrupting each other talking over each other I like to give

(1:06:03) people opportunity to speak she just wasn't having it instead of just being like you know what yeah I did interrupt

(1:06:09) I was doing a sidebar sorry I would have just moved it on she had to be Lippy she had to give

(1:06:15) me attitude and then I said look if you can't follow the rules you're going to

(1:06:21) have to leave I gave her I trust me if she was on the certain another

(1:06:26) podcast she would have be gone much quicker than here I gave her a lot of opportunities I tried to tell her what

(1:06:31) she was doing wrong so she could correct it she didn't she got the kick and then after

(1:06:39) when the uh predictable kick was coming based off of her conduct after I warned

(1:06:44) her then she was like okay well let me just try to maliciously sabotage your show by saying these things are not

(1:06:50) appropriate for the platforms um then she attempted to assault Andrew that's actually like a criminal act Andrew if

(1:06:56) you were so inclined you could probably like f call the police in my benevolence I'll let this one go the patriarchy is

(1:07:04) benevolent so before where I was getting to we haven't

(1:07:09) even gotten into relationship status uh I was about to say that the debate

(1:07:14) partner that you have for tomorrow Andrew uh she has canceled she's cancelled uh I'm going to try to fill

(1:07:21) with something else okay um doesn't matter maybe Kenzie wants the round two tomorrow I don't know I

(1:07:27) leave at 5: a.m. tomorrow unfortunately not but I'll try to replace with something else but the everything else is solid uh but maybe just come and do a

(1:07:37) Q&A possibly uh Blake I'm going to have you pull up the window tab but make sure

(1:07:42) not to show the Instagram so guys this woman has bailed on Andrew I don't know if you recall this woman she was on a

(1:07:49) dating talk panel Andrew I don't know if you recall this this woman here uh just leave it there that's fine and just

() 

(1:07:55) leave leave it there leave it there and so uh she did this already once to

(1:08:00) Andrew now mind you Andrew th he flies out here at at time

(1:08:06) and expense we help him out with that with the costs so this is the second time she's kind of done this at this

(1:08:12) point I have to assume it's Mal malicious excuse me we relied on her agreement and promise this is the

(1:08:19) lawsuit component we uh we agreed and relied to our detriment there's legal

(1:08:25) principle called detrimental Reliance if you rely on the promise of somebody else

(1:08:31) and it detriments you in some way you have a a claim so I'm actually going to

(1:08:36) file a lawsuit against this girl because it's just I can't have people doing this to Andrew they're just last minute oh

(1:08:44) and the the reason was which mind you she she was already aware she was like oh I don't like his

(1:08:51) like political leanings and like his positions I'm like you were aware of that before we booked

(1:08:59) you what that's what you're coming on to debate in any case um so I am going to

(1:09:05) follow lawsuit against her and just because I can't have people [ __ ] over Andrew like this can't have people

(1:09:10) [ __ ] over the podcast Andrew comes out here he's got a family he's got other stuff going on it's incredibly

(1:09:16) disrespectful and rude uh to the to us to Andrew so I have to do something like

(1:09:22) hey if you're going to [ __ ] with us and Troll and take up uh a booking I'm just going to follow a lawsuit against you so

(1:09:28) anyways um so that was the update before we got into the whole uh waking up with

(1:09:34) that sort of okay hey it's Chris Scott good guy Chris uh I've seen a lot of episodes Brian has the P patience of a saint most people would not tolerate the

(1:09:41) amount of disrespect women give him uh hey Christopher I really appreciate it thank you man yeah I mean dealing with

(1:09:47) somebody like that my patience is going to be pretty limited but I like to think

(1:09:52) I gave her some opportunities to try to correct course because my instead of just kicking

(1:09:58) somebody off I'm like here's what you're doing wrong can you stop doing that and

(1:10:04) if you can't help me out and be like you know what yeah I shouldn't interrupt sorry I won't do it again but if you're

(1:10:09) just going to be antagonistic like she is she's going to get the kick so don't

(1:10:15) like to have to kick people but it is what it is okay um we got a couple things coming through here Chromo Jones

(1:10:21) gifted I I don't know if this already came up kaiaka thank you for the choma Jones thank you for the gifted 10 kaiaka

(1:12:44) lingering doubts about whether modern day women automatically deserve chivalry by default I think that

(1:12:50) wait I think that earlier incident all but wrapped up that debate in a little B

(1:12:55) oh you know it's funny that girl's been on the show before and she was like oh yeah men should pay for First Dates men should be shiverers blah blah blah and

(1:13:01) it's like your conduct is not ladylike you don't deserve chivalry uh okay we

(1:13:06) have but Lucas that's a very good observation wal the day Andrew Grace their podcast was the mo most important

(1:13:13) day of their lives to him it was Tuesday okay I'll pull this back up when Andrew's here um let's see here uh oh

(1:14:00) we're going to pop this bottle and then we're going to get right into the actual uh show so um while I'm doing that does

(1:14:09) anybody um I I have something I just have to say

(1:14:14) I didn't expect to get um buzzed before we even start anything but thank you we

(1:14:19) need it after all of that I have thank you Charlie thank you

(1:14:24) Charli let's see here hitting women podcast defending yourself against women is like

(1:14:30) defending yourself against children I don't know if you're in I don't know if you're in favor of of ma men defending

(1:14:39) themselves or against it I don't know but uh thank you for the uh the message man do you want to pour for uh the

(1:14:45) people here uh we I think we get Kenzie's been fair I think Kenzie you want some not a lot oh no you know

(1:14:53) what I I I didn't allow her to have champagne initially but now she's like

(1:14:59) no I I I don't know why that upsets you no it's it's kind of fun it's actually kind of funny it's clever um it is uh it

(1:15:07) is good I mean I I appreciate I appreciate the offer if you want me to say if you want to thank I'll accept it

(1:15:12) I'll accept it I have something to say I have something to say oh um so you were upset that she called Andrew a Grapist

(1:15:20) and that you know she made his image look bad in front of thousands of people sure but then right now you were saying

(1:15:27) that oh I heard you say that you understand what the slurs that she was calling us you said that earlier like oh

(1:15:33) you understand you said that you understand the slurs that she was saying why she was saying these slurs when I

(1:15:39) didn't say I understand I don't understand if somebody on this side's talking just switch it over okay and I'm

(1:15:44) saying I told you that I did not agree with the slurs that she was calling you or saying on the podcast but then you're

(1:15:50) trying to make it seem that you know in front of this in front of this podcast in front of thousands of people that I

(1:15:56) am okay with that and I do agree that she was saying that why why would you make me look bad like that when you

(1:16:02) didn't want him to look bad like why why did you think that was bad but not you making me look like that was yeah so

(1:16:08) I'll answer that in three parts so the first part is uh I don't have the same level of rapport with you that I have

() 

(1:16:14) with Andrew Andrew is I've known Andrew for two years he's a friend of mine I'm going to come to the defense of a friend

(1:16:20) quicker than a total stranger who's actually an op and opposition secondly um I think her me saying that you agreed

(1:16:28) with the statement that she said is not on the same level of uh egregiousness as

(1:16:35) her calling him a literal that's not what I said okay what in any case

(1:16:40) whatever you did do and whatever my interpretation of it my interpretation would be is that what she did is more

(1:16:47) egregious than whatever I did to you by saying that you were like kind of backing her and like kind of like yeah

(1:16:54) you go girl no I never was like that I would liter like oh my God they're such

(1:16:59) jerks yeah you were like you were like you want me to push her out no it's going to make the situation worse no but

(1:17:05) I don't think you need to be like co-signing her conduct oh that's your phone that's your

(1:17:11) fun that's for fun sometimes you got to be positive to get the problem out the way sorry I'm not that's fine it's not a

(1:17:16) big deal I want to move on from The Meta conversation but I don't think it's like I don't really think it's a fair comparison to be like it's it's

(1:17:23) literally just you know just treating human beings you know like respect I mean I'm calling you out for you being

(1:17:30) like a part of The Sisterhood and this is something this is just a generalized criticism hold on hold on yes this is a

(1:17:36) generalized criticism that I have of women is that there's a tendency to like look at bad conduct that other women are

(1:17:44) doing and just kind of like uh what's the perfect word for it uh condone no

(1:17:50) there's another word for it like um brush it off uh it sort of brush off but it's a specific condone did you already

(1:17:57) say it is condone but I'm looking for a specific turn of phrase um sort of like rug sweep or like you kind of just like

(1:18:03) sweep it under the rug it's not sweep it under the rug it's kind of like wave janies no not no it's like they're

(1:18:09) janies they're janit they're janning it up no no no no it's uh chat help me out because I'm I'm totally brain fogging

(1:18:16) here oh whatever I just thought that was kind of weird how you were acting like that and then just like you could do that towards another person when you're

(1:18:23) upset that someone else did that like you're upset that someone else can act like that but it's okay for you to do it

(1:18:28) I think my assessment of kind of weird and you're a grown adult so like you kind of you should know that's that's

(1:18:34) like it's common sense to not be like that but you know you you obious it's handwave I was looking for hand waving a

(1:18:41) lot of women handwave other women's poor Behavior I wasn't telling her you were hand waving her poor Behavior I was

(1:18:47) literally never telling her like good job or nothing like no I was not giving her an award for I was not aing so jerks

(1:18:55) I SL slay Queen you're so I'm not going to lie you are you you guys are

(1:19:00) disrespectful like you like you were your eyes like a little child how was I disrespectful until I was disrespected I

(1:19:07) mean you can you can disagree with someone but still be respectful like how how was I specifically disrespectful

(1:28:52) situationship um sorry no you're good I wouldn't even call it a situationship um

(1:28:58) it was um someone who I really liked for a long period of time voice that to them and I would say according to them it was

(1:29:05) not reciprocated even though the actions were um shown to be

(1:29:10) different okay so you're single yes sir never had a boyfriend correct um let me

(1:29:16) pull up your notes on this because I have a couple uh have you ever been on a date

(1:29:22) um just recently I went 20 years without dating um but I told myself going into this year I wanted to at least open up

(1:29:29) to it um cuz nothing will come from anything if I don't give it a try Okay um hold on I'm I'm trying to get to your

(1:29:34) notes on this and uh you're Christian also correct yes sir the nomination uh

(1:29:41) non denom I grew up Methodist though gotcha okay and uh you said in your notes you never dated anyone nor gone on

(1:29:48) a date you said you don't trust men correct you don't believe men correct and you don't understand men correct

() 

(1:29:55) when you say you don't trust men what do you mean um so I put it out there pretty

(1:30:01) early that I'm not into hookups I'm not into um just hitting and dipping I am

(1:30:07) not about that I'm not for that um I know a lot of people are and I voice that very early on to talking to someone

(1:30:14) and I've gotten myself into a lot of situations where I tell them no I tell them I'm not going to do it get into it

(1:30:20) and they try to pursue something and I have to get myself out of something thing that I shouldn't have to um I make

(1:30:26) it very apparent at the beginning of talking to someone that I'm not going to have sex with you like I'm not doing it

(1:30:32) and they you know they still persist and it's just very frustrating and you you wrote here so you've never been on any

(1:30:39) dates nor gone on a date uh you are Christian you said that in your notes that you lost your virginity at 20 so

(1:30:45) like about a year ago uh yes sir okay with someone who you said you were very comfortable with and you trusted correct

(1:30:52) uh how long but you I'm a bit confused because you said you've never dated anyone or gone on a date yeah so I kind

(1:30:57) of planned on being in a relationship um I have never met anyone who was a virgin

(1:31:04) um at my age and I never felt uncomfortable with it I never I was honestly very proud of it like it wasn't

(1:31:10) a something that I was ashamed of um I think morally I'm very there I'm very right and I just never met anyone with

(1:31:18) it and so finding someone who I had a relationship with a really good friend and I felt comfortable with him enough

(1:31:24) to have that connection with him um and unfortunately just never went anywhere after that I see okay and uh

(1:31:33) so I want to stay too I made like we waited about two years um of being in a

(1:31:38) friendship and I knew that it wasn't a sexual thing oh hey you can't you got to be careful you

(1:31:45) can't if you kick under the tripod is right there man um I'll have to go fix

(1:31:50) that in a sec um okay go ahead yeah no I just I knew it wasn't a sexual thing I

(1:31:56) had plenty of people tell me around me that um he was just in it to you know get it from me and there were multiple

(1:32:02) different situations where he actually didn't want to pursue it with me um because he didn't want to lose our

(1:32:07) friendship now that I matured a year later I kind of look back at it um and

(1:32:13) kind of see some of the manipulation um that happened but I will never reg it a couple clarifying questions here so you

(1:32:21) were you were friends with him correct for two years yes sir and so was there a

(1:32:28) period of time where prior to you guys having hooked up that you had where it

(1:32:33) was going in like a more romantic direction or was the hookup like you guys were always friends and this was

(1:32:40) like you did have like a comfort with him and it was kind of maybe spontaneous

(1:32:45) hookup um no it was definitely a connection with him I he's the first guy

(1:32:51) I've ever really liked like that I can count on one hand like the amount of people that I've liked in my life and um

(1:32:58) I felt that connection with him I felt that bond with him I'm not someone who flurt with guys I have a hard time

(1:33:03) talking to people actually and I he's the first person I've ever been able to open up to um and truly truly truly grow

(1:33:10) connection with and that's when kind of the gaslighting and manipulation comes in cuz I thought it would maybe

(1:33:16) potentially turn into something more before having a sexual relationship with him uh I had such a good friendship with

(1:33:21) him that I thought something would come from so I guess I understand that you guys were friends for the initial part of your uh

(1:33:28) relationship with him and when I say relationship that could apply to a friendship or just your your

(1:33:33) relationship with him in totality including the friendship and the uh romantic and sexual component um so I

(1:33:40) guess how um had you guys did you guys only hook up once um no it was a few

(1:33:46) times um a couple times um so how I guess how long into

(1:33:53) the friendship did it kind of get more into like a romantic feel I guess um it was always

(1:34:00) there and that's kind of the problem that I have with it is he actually ended

(1:34:05) up dating someone like in the middle of our kind of connection I would say and

(1:34:11) when I voiced that to him like I never talk bad about him I always stood up for him I'm like he's a great guy like I was

(1:34:17) happy for him I hope I wished him the best honestly um I just wanted him to be happy at the end of the day and people

(1:34:22) were talking bad about his name about about the fact that he didn't like me back and how I was such a great person

(1:34:28) and he actually got on to me and was like you're bashing my name and I'm like I would never I would never do that and

(1:34:33) I told him I'm like we we've Kissed before we've had intimate moments together and he told me that there was

(1:34:40) nothing there and that he never felt anything um and that basically I was just making it all up in my head so so

(1:34:46) is this after you guys had hooked up this before Oh before yes sir wait so he told you he feels nothing for you

(1:34:53) correct and why did you pursue it um it was that was about a couple months later whenever

(1:34:59) our relationship actually grew as friends from him being trying to grow a connection with this other person um

(1:35:07) and yeah I honestly I like I said I trusted him enough um it was

(1:35:14) more the moment that I did I guess lose my virginity and stuff like that as to

(1:35:20) come hoping to be in a long-term relationship with someone who I truly love I loved him um and I told him that

(1:35:25) I genu how he respond um I cried for like 3 weeks so he said

(1:35:33) thank you he he um he was in shock like I said he told me that we would kiss

(1:35:40) like non you know not just like we were at a bar and we're making out like we would have those moments together and he

(1:35:46) he later on confessed that he just said it because he didn't want me to like

(1:35:52) think that there was an Ever chance with us um so they were just what did he say he he told me like so beginning he told

(1:35:59) me that I just made it all up in my head then later on he told me that there was

(1:36:05) actually something there but that we could never be together he was Hispanic so his first excuse was that his family

(1:36:10) didn't speak English um and then his next excuse hold

(1:36:16) on he wait so what was he blaming on his English as a second language status yeah

(1:36:23) that his parents didn't speak English so he could never date a white girl because I wouldn't be able to have that

(1:36:29) relationship with his family oh okay I I see what he was saying I thought you were saying there was a there was like a

(1:36:35) miscommunication and he blamed it on second the second language no um one sec

(1:36:41) I'll get to you in a sec um and so you um so how long I mean did you continue

(1:36:49) so you guys hooked up how long did you continue to see him after the hookup a couple it was on and off um for I would

(1:36:56) say a couple months but I began to realize that it was only when it was convenient for him um and when you say

(1:37:03) convenient for him you mean like spending time together when he wanted to so he would text you at 11:00 p.m. on a

(1:37:09) Friday saying what are you doing come over um it was more of like we went to the gym together we would I bought food

(1:37:17) for him like we would go out we would we spent a lot of time together and he was my genuinely like my best friend and it

(1:37:23) was just kind of I guess that side of it that we were helping each other out on cuz I only had one body and I'm keeping

(1:37:30) it to that and um that was just kind of what that was there for right so you wrote here that uh you will you're going

(1:37:36) to be waiting until you find your Forever person to get with anyone further on so are you waiting until

(1:37:42) marriage um I want to be in love with someone knowing that they will be I I

(1:37:48) plan on talking about this because it's so hard to say 100% I would love to wait to till marriage I would give anything

(1:37:54) to do that and for my last person to be my forever person the fact of the matter is if you say that to a guy that you

(1:38:00) just start talking to and just meeting it scares them away I I I can't voice that enough that I can say straight up

(1:38:07) how I feel that I want the next person that I have intimacy with to be my

(1:38:12) forever person I can't say that without scaring someone away okay um and you said you only have one body and you plan

(1:38:19) to keep it that way until you meet your Forever person yes sir um

(1:38:26) I guess my I guess my confusion here a little bit is it did it doesn't sound

(1:38:33) like this was your standard with this guy is that fair to say yes sir yeah it

(1:38:41) 100% wasn't and I will never regret anything um obviously I do wish that I

(1:38:47) lasted 20 years and I planed to keep doing that my Purity and um you know

(1:38:53) where where my morals are was not kind of how I acted in it but I think I still have those in me and I know I still have

(1:38:58) those in me and I sounds like you regret it I will never regret anything um like

(1:39:05) I way you talk about it though you say it sounds like you do regret it I wish that I wasn't I'm not going to use the

(1:39:11) word gaset I wish that something would have came from it at least because I did genuinely I love this man and um now

(1:39:19) back at it but it sounds like he basically always told you it was n reciprocal he later on told me it was

(1:39:26) but then that's when the excuses started to come into play of why we could never be together but you hadn't slept with

(1:39:33) him at that point right um the beginning no I hadn't yeah so the the term from

(1:39:39) that to when he said no it's never going to become anything to then the later

(1:39:44) time where you actually did sleep with this guy what was he saying to you then

(1:39:50) afterwards yeah um no up to the point up to that point after so let's go to point

(1:39:56) a point a is gaslighting says he can't really be with you this and that then he

(1:40:02) says he can yeah right but then he also says Ah but not really yeah so then how did you get from

(1:40:09) I don't really want this long-term relationship to now I'm sleeping with the guy yeah so what's odd enough is

() 

(1:40:14) that the day that we got together I actually met his family for the first time that day um when I had just turned

(1:40:22) 20 he sent me a long paragraph about how he doesn't think that it's right for us to do it and that he doesn't want me to

(1:40:27) catch feelings and that if I did I would fall madly in love with him Bubby I was already in love with you before like we

(1:40:33) hooked up frankly getting with him did nothing like it didn't change where I was with him so he sent you all this

(1:40:39) before you hooked up with him yeah this was like months before this was like three months before we got together so you were the pursuer um no not

(1:40:46) necessarily because he sent me that and that's how I knew that it wasn't for a sexual reason like he truly wanted to be

(1:40:53) we were truly best friends that he liked me for who I was and he would defend me till the end of the day like it wasn't a

(1:40:59) sexual thing for for a man to tell a woman that I don't want to hook up with you because like I want to keep our

(1:41:05) friendship like I don't want you to catch feelings for me all that stuff I mean that says a lot about who he was that's how I saw it I was like you

(1:41:11) you're not going to you know you're giving I'm basically I was here like I had had a little bit to drink that day I

(1:41:17) was texting him I was ready and for him to tell me that like no I don't think we

(1:41:24) should I mean that said a lot to me and so passed forward three months I drove

(1:41:30) all the way a couple hours to go pick him up from his family's house met his family everything um went over to watch I had I

(1:41:38) had slept with him like before like watching movies and stuff like that but nothing more than you know that um

(1:41:43) staying with him I guess you could say um and so just there's been times where

(1:41:48) I've said no I'm not ready and this time you know I was ready and cuz I trusted

(1:41:54) him so much to have that connection like I was embarrassed like I'm very self-conscious in myself who I am as a

(1:41:59) person body all that stuff and so I trusted him so much that I was ready to open myself up to him it still sounds

(1:42:06) kind of like you were the pursuer though like am I wrong there or

(1:42:14) um I don't want to say I thought something would come from it not that I would hook up with him and that oh he

(1:42:20) would fall madly in love with me no I just had that connection with him and like I said like I don't regret doing it

(1:42:26) I don't I don't know I don't know I don't want to stay on the pursuer I think it was completely Mutual like cuz there's been times where I've told him

(1:42:32) no I'm not ready and like we could have very much so multiple different times yeah right but if it so I guess this the

(1:42:39) mindset I'm trying to get um so multiple times this guy told

(1:42:45) you yeah I really don't want to do this cuz if we do it's going to ruin

(1:42:50) everything right and then when he did it did ruin everything right no no you're

(1:42:55) still still good friends with this guy um I've distanced myself because as I said like I've matured and I'm ready to

(1:43:00) open myself up to a future husband and a lifelong relationship so after you slept with him he's da he started dating other

(1:43:07) people right uh yeah he went back with his ex after he yeah okay yeah I kind of

(1:43:12) figured so so the thing is is I mean he he did he did kind of tell you though um

(1:43:18) he did that's why like I don't like frankly I would never get in a relationship with him even after when we

(1:43:25) were hooking up um I knew that nothing would come from it and I didn't want anything come from like it sounds like if he if he walked away from his current

(1:43:32) girl right this second called you and said you know I actually do adore you and I just made a huge mistake that he

(1:43:38) would be right back in there Andrew I refused to because I gave this man everything I could have offered him everything and he turned me down and I

(1:43:44) refused to be the second choice yes I was hooking up with him at the time but that was strictly because I'm not I'm

(1:43:50) definitely not adding another body to me and you know it was pleasuring um but

(1:43:57) the way that he treated me the way that he made me feel I refused to ever feel like that again I I refuse to and I I

(1:44:05) swear on all like if he would have thrown everything down and said I'm ready to be with you I would never I I would not do it cuz I know what I

(1:44:11) deserve and like at the time you know I was immature and all right I'm going to move it on but what we can maybe come

(1:44:17) back to some of that a little bit later on so okay uh going to Jen here I'm going to need you to scoot into the table cuz you're just yes far away um so

(1:44:26) Jen you wrote in your pre-show notes that you would like to come on the podcast as someone who looks like a

() 

(1:44:32) bimbo but has an actual IQ yeah we're going to go split okay um so fix the

(1:44:37) split uh so what is your IQ I guess um I

(1:44:42) am dyslexic in in school I um actually got tested not one of these stupid um

(1:44:49) online things um yeah I was one for 43 damn well that's is that men wait you

(1:44:57) you were over 140 yeah 143 I have a twin sister she was 142 my brother the percentage of the population that's over

(1:45:04) 140 is extremely small I know wait you you said you took it

(1:45:09) on yeah I did it in school eth grade cuz yeah I was hold on hold on that's what I was about to ask you said you took it in

(1:45:16) school how old were you when you took it I was um fifth grade you got had 143 score

(1:45:25) on the IQ test in fifth grade 11 in fifth grade

(1:45:30) yeah what what was the cost what was the cost for the IQ test um there was no

(1:45:36) cost I was having issues I had a slur and I wasn't like performing um like

(1:45:41) that's actually really common they take they do assessments so yeah they were trying to like hold me back grades and

(1:45:46) stuff but yeah during the assessment um have you had a tested as an adult no you

(1:45:52) know it fluctuates yeah I know yeah but I mean when I see people on the show still the same or I

(1:45:58) mean I wouldn't say it's that high but I'd say it's higher than average okay all right um You said that

(1:46:05) you don't sleep around and you would like to debate on things you said you agree with a lot that is said on the show there are just some things you

(1:46:11) would like to give your input on um so I guess the first thing is some of the

(1:46:16) things that you want to get into I think we had initially had you scheduled but then there was a cancellation and you

(1:46:22) wrote to to us saying the following considering what is happening to our nation right now I'm not sure it is in

(1:46:28) my best interest to be associated with your podcast we are in the uh [ __ ] around and find out stage of politics

(1:46:34) yall say that Democrats are the delusional ones but that's not ACC I'm not a Democrat first of all sure but you

(1:46:40) did say you all say that Democrats are the delusional ones but that's not accurate at all I say I think both sides are delusional that's what I meant okay

(1:46:47) yeah so Democrats are delusional but s of the Republicans all of it the whole system

(1:46:53) uh dulu dulu okay um you said that well you also realized like Brian's an

(1:46:59) independent right oh yeah I mean I didn't know that but um I'm just saying in general I'm not blaming Brian for the

(1:47:05) dulu of the world um I'm not blaming Brian for the dulu of the world okay yeah Am I who did I vote

(1:47:12) for well you independently voted for Trump oh sure I had to give Trump many

(1:47:19) independent sure sure that's I'm not blaming Brian I mean show in general and uh sure sure aspects of that um so I'm G

(1:47:28) to wait so hold on I'm going to make a note to come back to this but I'm going to jump to some of your other

(1:47:33) disagreements um so you said that uh

(1:47:38) we're good at debate techniques AKA manipulation techniques oh yeah a lot of

() 

(1:47:44) debate is just a form of manipulation like it's not about winning the debate it's about uh controlling the

(1:47:50) conversation whoever's in control um there's a lot of people that aren't um used to debate and those

(1:47:58) tactics so they're quiet and uh they get confused easily and they are more

(1:48:04) agreeable in those situations and it doesn't really it's not constructive to actually coming to Solutions in society

(1:48:11) it's more like who's the winner who's the loser and it just kind of when you say that there's birth problem birth

(1:48:17) rate problems and hatred uh well he does um it's kind of not

(1:48:23) sorry finish the hatred of oh on both there's more hatred on both sides of the Sexes

(1:48:31) comments and people um if if you want a society to work we should come to

(1:48:37) Solutions instead of uh having uh see like I love this type of ideology

(1:48:46) letl I have more respect for the Marxist feminist over there next to you and here's here's here's actually why yeah

(1:48:52) okay cuz she picks a side she and here's the thing right it's like hang on hang

(1:48:57) on I'll explain right so if you're a knight on a battlefield and you're going out to battle right and in the modernity

(1:49:03) in modernity the battle is the infowar and debate what sorry the information

(1:49:08) war that is the battle in modernity and the tool that we have one of the Primary

(1:49:14) Weapons we have is debate and discourse people are going to be good at it they're going to be bad at it I agree with that portion of it right yeah

(1:49:20) you're a good Master the worst part the worst part is when people refuse to pick a side of it oh I mean hang on hang on

(1:49:26) hang on almost done it's when they refuse to pick a side of it right at least I know her side and at least she

(1:49:32) knows my side so at least when we go to the battlefield right and we're duking it out um we understand what the hell it

(1:49:39) is we're fighting for you like the position that you have of the perceived neutrality right I'm not that neutral

(1:49:46) that's the thing right is that I don't think you're neutral I think though that you're trying to frame this as though

(1:49:52) you're I'm not neutral I I'm I'm not a Democrat I'm not blaming you for this I'm here for a solution I'm libertarian

(1:49:58) I'm here for a solution not just fighting against each other and making with people who

(1:50:04) disagree with libertarianism the Marxist feminist does and I do I'm coming I I don't care I want a solution to the

(1:50:11) problem instead of fighting against each other all the time do does it bother you that he's independent just curious I I'm

(1:50:18) more independent that he's independent since he hasn't picked that was like obviously me joking I don't know if you

(1:50:24) picked that up or not but that's why he was laughing oh gotcha okay so I was like that's why I'm here is I was

(1:50:30) obvious that was like obviously me joking but anyway that that yeah why I'm here is um like we're all repulsed from

(1:50:37) each other and what your show is doing is making us more repuls from each other what is it actually doing to help

(1:50:42) Society sure well I'll I'll answer that in a couple ways so before I do don't

(1:50:48) want to quite let you get away with this so you said uh we're good at debate Tech techniques AKA manipulation techniques

(1:50:55) uh I explain that why I say it's manipulation yeah give me a precise example of like a a scenario in which

(1:51:02) either tonight or like a previous show I have I hold on hold on let me finish stop stop stop stop stop let me finish

(1:51:09) let me get my words sorry sorry can you pre present either tonight

(1:51:14) or previous episode a manipulation technique I've employed go ahead oh it's not you it's him uh really yeah yeah I

(1:51:22) don't have that many problems with you you're nice oh I never said problem okay well I'll come back to that and you guys

(1:51:28) can have that conversation then let me I'll get through it's not you but you have an issue with the show so I'll address that one you said that uh let's

(1:51:34) see here you wrote well I'll come through a couple things you said that uh you that we bring on young women with no

() 

(1:51:40) education to to bait on things they know nothing about yeah like only fans girls and stuff yeah well so very small

(1:51:47) percentage so let me um let me hold on hold on hold on so

(1:51:52) like to address the multiple false claims here when you say young woman give me an age like early 20s that's a

(1:52:00) okay I'm 37 so I would call that like young so what do you think is like the appropriate age where you're allowed to

(1:52:06) have like a conversation with somebody oh you can have a conversation any age I'm just saying if you mostly get people

(1:52:11) who are not educated and like get their views off of Tik Tok then you're not

(1:52:16) going to get a realistic hang I just want to point something out yeah how old are you 23 and what your education level

(1:52:24) bachelor's anything else no I'm talking about social media influence I don't know I don't get it no wait I really

(1:52:29) don't get it 23 years old you're bachelor's degree I have no bachelor's degree hang on I don't have any

(1:52:37) bachelor's degree I'm not talking about like going to college I'm talking about

(1:52:42) just real world experience yeah so these people vote yeah maybe I don't agree I I

(1:52:50) think we should raise that I think we should raise the age of alcohol 25 25 so

(1:52:56) look I'll just address the multiple false claims you said that we bring on their opinions okay you said that we bring on

(1:53:03) young women with no education I'll just explore the young woman part that so we keep statistics on our guests the

(1:53:09) average age of the guests on our show are 26 cool that's good I I just mean

(1:53:14) education on we're not just bringing in what's the oldest oh older than me we've had on women in their 40s 50s and 60s

(1:53:21) are you talking about me are like consistently average usually there's panels with most panels are pretty mixed

(1:53:27) where you have an older and younger demographic so I'm just curious even right now even right now we do so I'm closer in age to you want y to take what

(1:53:35) I say and use it like I mean what I do mean is that people in a

(1:53:42) younger generation are influenced by social media and they don't really have that much real life experience and that

(1:53:48) makes it an issue that with fake media it goes on both Sid I mean fake F news it goes on both sides and people don't

(1:53:54) really know what's actually going on so wait what you're saying is that young people tie in to social media in order

(1:54:02) to inform their worldview and we're on social media assisting in informing their worldview why would this be a

(1:54:09) problem I mean all of it's delusional like I said both sides

(1:54:14) um uh Democrat and Republican it's become a huge issue but young people are

(1:54:19) more susceptible to Democrats are not delusional and Republicans are not delusional areion and a lot of people

(1:54:26) who hold delusions and there's creators who hold delusions and things like this right you have opposition ideologies

(1:54:34) which people do come to through reasoned discourse in their own ingroup and they're not always unreasonable

(1:54:40) ideologies it is true it is true that I'm not saying that I'm just saying people are heavily influenced they do

(1:54:46) need to be combed from my view right and from her view like let's take Kinsey for instance she's that's what she's trying

(1:54:53) to do she's trying to combat ideologies which she considers to be counterproductive to the society she wants to see same thing with me trying

(1:55:00) to combat ideologies which are counterproductive to the society that I want to see if the venue that we do this

(1:55:05) in is social media you're saying that that's where young people go right why in the world is that not exactly where

(1:55:12) we would be in order to produce the ideology you want to see for the world because it's always uh left or right if

(1:55:19) you when you view one when you view one side it you only view that side and you

(1:55:25) don't view the other side and then if only there was a show that had conservative Christians and Marxist feminist debating listen I'm not I'm not

(1:55:33) where could we find not finished I'm not finished I'm not finished see like I I

(1:55:39) completely lost what I was saying because you interrupted me so what was the last thing that we said you were saying that uh

(1:55:45) essentially um you don't present the other side and so I was I was just saying I don't think there should be two

(1:55:51) sides okay there shouldn't be two sides first of all I don't believe in a two-party system and that's where my

(1:55:57) opinion comes from is I don't think there should be one one's right one's

(1:56:03) wrong so I'd like to bring it back to the actual criticism yeah which is that you bring on young women with no

(1:56:09) education so I've already provided statistics that we keep pretty

(1:56:14) thoroughly the average age of Our Guest say only you just criticized him for interrupting you I've asked you I've

(1:56:20) asked you to let me finish it's okay let me finish all right I tend to be fairly quick soor um you said that we bring on

(1:56:28) women young women with no education whether they're older young we do bring a women on with education uh there are

(1:56:34) women here who are educated we've had on phds we have on a PhD uh or I guess doctorate I don't know if it's still

(1:56:40) called a PhD in nursing or is it just I don't know whatever in any case we bring

(1:56:45) on we've brought on women who have bachelor's degrees master's degrees phds

(1:56:51) we've also bring on women who have dropped out of college here's the thing though just like me because I don't have

(1:56:57) some Advanced degree in uh sociology or politics or philosophy or any of this

(1:57:02) stuff I'm a College Dropout so I don't think it would actually can you actually State what what would be wrong with me

(1:57:08) as a College Dropout talking to somebody else who's a College Dropout what would actually be wrong with that oh I'm not

() 

(1:57:14) talking about that when I say uneducated I mean people with no life experience

(1:57:19) everybody has a life experience um if you're talking to only fan girlss who show their boobs online have never had a

(1:57:25) job and don't know anything about politics then I would call them uneducated here's that only fans girls

(1:57:31) are 21 18 to I'm not saying it's a just an a our old the Maj the majority of the

(1:57:41) girls on here that are on this side of the table are not conservative side of

(1:57:46) the table not a single girl does anybody no girl here does only even the the the the the Great the no that that's great

(1:57:54) doesn't have only fans I just mean the majority when you have these it's not the majority it's 15% here tell tell me

(1:58:00) oh 15% gu guess how many of my guests do only fans well you said 15% that's it

(1:58:07) that's more than the average population uh well hang on of only fans we're looking we're looking at the potential

(1:58:14) that in the next 10 years of one in 10 Zoomer women do only fans 15 15% in that

(1:58:21) demographic it is a slight over representation but not much what's the it's still I mean it still applies to

(1:58:27) what I'm saying is it one in 10 now I don't think it is one I don't know anyone who does only

(1:58:35) fans hang on it's slated to be uh but the point is is that even if it's a slight over representation one it's not

(1:58:41) Zoomers it's across the board I'm just pointing out in Zoomers there's a

(1:58:47) potential uh well no it's not 1 and 10 I'm sorry maybe it's 1 and3 I don't remember but the point is it's still

(1:58:54) it's very very high okay whatever the percent percentile would be for Zoomers with only fans but the percentage of

(1:59:01) only fans models is increasing models the only fans girls are increasing prostitution is increasing sex work is

(1:59:08) increasing it's a very easy way for a lot of women to try to make a buck I disagree with that well great that's

(1:59:14) great you disagree with it but that means it's a representation of people have an ideology which needs to be

(1:59:20) combed if you agree with it okay I agree with that but when you're bringing on

(1:59:26) more only fans people and the normal population I don't only people who do

(1:59:31) only fans uh the normal world most of us don't really come I don't think that brings on the representation population

(1:59:38) of doctors of nurses of if you take the show stats you probably they're too busy to do it no what I'm saying is that

(1:59:45) regardless of the population at large versus the percentage that comes on the

(1:59:50) podcast itself I don't think he probably has a representation population for any of them why would he that makes no sense

(1:59:58) because yeah they they have real issues to deal with I mean I mean we have a woman who has a doctorate in nursing

(2:00:04) here but in any case that's awesome yeah but um I told you my view on education

(2:00:09) I'm not saying literally doctorates I say people that like came from yeah they came from bad childhood they went into

(2:00:16) bad situations and you bring them on to generalize women or generalize men in

(2:00:22) situations so let me just address something you said previously it's actually specific right no you

(2:00:28) generalize all the time like you said this whole table didn't respond to it's a generalization I actually think that's

(2:00:34) totally fair to say that saying we're majority when it's not you make generalized statements right but when

(2:00:39) we're talking to each individual here we're honing down on specifics that you gave us no yeah I'm yeah that's fine I I

(2:00:46) mean you my issue is generalizing that people who go on here

(2:00:52) with um I guess like more [ __ ] jobs and stuff for like the general population and if you see the comments

(2:00:59) and stuff general population prevented from being a [ __ ] because they don't have a [ __ ] job wa wait hold on wait wait really quick hold on hold on one

(2:01:05) sec hold hold on there's did you see this funny meme on Twitter the other day it was like what people think [ __ ]

() 

(2:01:11) dress like and what they actually dress like and it's like some Street walkers on the left and what they actually dress

(2:01:16) like is they're wearing scrubs we have a nurse here um our nurse I mean I don't know if you want to throw

(2:01:23) I if you want toow your fellow nurses under the bus but isn't it the case that a lot of the Nur not you not you but

(2:01:30) like the other nurses they get down right am I okay so that's a yes but okay go ahead go ahead okay I I personally

(2:01:38) don't know any but I will say that you don't know any I I don't the reputation

(2:01:43) yeah yeah but I would say that there is a certain reputation that people who work in a hospital have I mean what gr's

(2:01:51) Anatomy is probably not a good example but you know you see little hookups and things like that and there have been I

(2:01:57) mean I have I have seen things but these are not my immediate circle well and it

(2:02:03) makes sense right so you have a demographic of people who are mostly female working that job and you have

(2:02:10) tons and tons of males who come through for a variety of reasons it makes total sense that there would be a lot of

(2:02:16) promiscuity in that industry same thing with flight attendants it's the same type of thing right very male flight

(2:02:22) attendants mostly female they go all over the place they interact with a lot of males it makes sense travel nurses is

(2:02:29) the intersection of that's just that's a rough one okay um I was a travel nurse

(2:02:35) so oh no oh no but I I not no I we need to get a giant red flag and like drape

(2:02:41) it on people something like that uh so I guess going back to it though uh if you

(2:02:48) have such an objection to the I guess the uh pool of guests that I bring on the show uh thank you for having me um I

(2:02:56) I just say I didn't finish my sentence I'm sorry I'm sorry I didn't mean to interrupt I'm I'm buzzed um I got buzzed

(2:03:03) really early due to the three champagne it wasn't that much champagne but okay um I don't drink a lot light did you see

(2:03:09) what JJ matches you got to pull that up dude so funny it's the funniest comment I've seen I'll find

(2:03:16) it hold on it's a YouTube side I got it I got it that really attractive after a couple

(2:03:23) of beers of a little pump oh my God all right so um all right sorry um sorry I got uh

(2:03:33) okay so I oh you have an objection to the guest that I bring on you don't like the composition of the guests whatever

(2:03:39) uh how about this if it's such an issue to you um and I'll pay you a referral fee for each person you send me cool

(2:03:45) send me women who don't do sex work don't do only fans that you think are appropriate to come on the show and I'll happily book them well you pay for their

() 

(2:03:52) travel expenses cuz mine my expenses were pretty expensive so yeah I mean

(2:03:57) they're yeah I'm lot of sure no one cares about exposure in my friend group

(2:04:04) I that's the normal population like in my group taking selfies and putting it

(2:04:09) on Instagram wait so how else can we roll out the red carpet for people that you would prefer to see on the show on

(2:04:15) our dime no cuz they don't care they have real lives like I mean they're they

(2:04:20) don't want to pay how do I get them on the show if they don't care he further flight so again so that you're so here

(2:04:27) was your brilliant plan hang want make get is Right brilliant plan yeah we I would like to get all of my friends on

(2:04:33) your show on your dime that you pay for all of them and then you then you go ahead and host them no he said he'd give

(2:04:38) you a referral fee I don't want your money I don't care about your money I get it but but do you realize how absurd

(2:04:44) it is to say well uh the problem is is that you don't have the correct I'll give them my feed stop stop let them

(2:04:51) finish you don't have the correct representation of people that I feel like should be on your show and all you would really have to do to get them is

(2:04:58) pay them a bunch of money not of money no not money where they make profit but

(2:05:03) I live in Texas it's not cheap to like just my motel was like 3 people from

(2:05:09) California I don't have friends in California I'm from Texas right so be a talent recruiter I'll pay you a referral

(2:05:15) fee try to recruit women from Los Angeles or the surrounding area who represent the world VI you want to see on the show I what I know why would I do

(2:05:22) that look I'm I'm literally extending an offer let them do that I don't live in California I have no friends here okay

(2:05:28) so I've extended an offer to you there's an open invitation girls girls can DM

(2:05:33) girls can DM the sh stop stop stop stop sorry sorry sorry girls can DM the show

(2:05:39) if they want to be on the show if they meet your criteria we can have them on the show we're super open-minded people

(2:05:45) can disagree that's kind of the show it's good if they disagree we like to have them on anyways I'm going to move

(2:05:51) on to your other criticisms so you said that you're a disabled woman yet you do construction and Woodworking and grow

(2:05:56) your own food and you know why because the government is so effed that you're preparing to Homestead and check out of

() 

(2:06:03) capitalism yeah um I'm not really going to bite on that but uh you said uh

(2:06:08) you're a Libertarian you're last say fair capitalist right that's am I I yeah

(2:06:14) I mean it's okay I'm not going to bite on it not going to B I'm a range of things but I'm scared for just as

(2:06:21) General Libertarians are lass a fair capitalist I am a very introverted

(2:06:27) person I don't like many people I would rather have a community [ __ ] does that have to do with being I'm going to tell

(2:06:33) you my plan with homestead if you would listen I don't really want another the plan I'm it's expensive no it's

(2:06:40) expensive so I'm going to have a community of people can you just scoot your mic scoot your mic towards you no

(2:06:45) scoot scoot it towards you cuz you pushed scoot it to the edge of the table edge of the table okay okay go ahead um

(2:06:50) my worldview is I want to check out of normal society in general um and buy a

(2:06:57) bunch of land bring people I age with my friends and we are going to I mean not

(2:07:03) check out of capitalism completely that would I mean not that sounds like another type of ism what is that though

(2:07:09) that would be like so like let's pretend hang on let's pretend that I had that I

(2:07:14) had a bunch we just pretend I had a bunch of friends and we went out to the middle of nowhere and we all shared

(2:07:20) resources and there was no capitalism it's not no and we were just like anybody who had a need of something the

(2:07:27) other people would provide for the need what type of ism would we be thinking about we still have jobs just not all of

(2:07:34) us have jobs and we just share yeah you just share according to their need

(2:07:40) right no no I I don't agree with any of that this is the opposite of libertarianism really is I I don't

(2:07:47) libertarian is I don't care about social stuff I I care about a small government Communists don't care about the

(2:07:54) Communist don't care about social [ __ ] either I care about a small government but what maybe it's the wrong view what

(2:08:00) is my view if I care about small government well it's not listen but I don't care about stupid crap

(2:08:06) that so so here's the thing what is my view I'm I'm going to explain it I'm going to explain it communism and

(2:08:12) libertarianism are opposite sides of the same coin the tailes in of the heads end here's how it works Communists affirm a

(2:08:19) stateless society through the fact that there needs to be no communal property whatsoever yeah I don't none no communal

(2:08:25) property Libertarians affirm that they want a stateless society where the only affirmation is property so so

(2:08:34) Libertarians they affirm their view in property and and that's how they want their stateless society right the only

(2:08:40) rights you have is property rights and the Communist is the opposite end of that they're saying we want a stateless

(2:08:45) society where there are no Pro nobody has property it's classless completely

(2:08:50) classless and that so it's it's a Tales end heads coin this is what Anne Rand proposes as well uh if you read Atlas

(2:08:57) Shrugged or if you read the The Fountain Head if you read any of these this is what you'll find with uh libertarian

(2:09:03) thought leaders even if you go to what's that guy's name um I can't linger too long yeah yeah just real quick I can't I

(2:09:11) can't think of his name for the life of me even though I've CED him multiple times but he talks a lot about

(2:09:16) monarchies you probably know who he is I can't he's a Libertarian thought leader but anyway the point is is like you're

(2:09:22) not talking about libertarianism here I'm not yeah I'm not I don't know the right what's yeah what's the correct

(2:09:27) term for that I don't know all I know is that I got to move it on I got to move it sure you can respond you can respond

(2:09:33) but I'm move it on what I'm saying is that it's a two there's a lot of stress in relationships due to where our

(2:09:38) economy is and power factors if we all wait did you just scoot your mic please

(2:09:44) no I didn't I didn't move it didn't move it really uh I didn't move it no I didn't I moved to the edge of the table

(2:09:50) and then you pushed it back no I no I didn't move it since you said not to move it we'll pull it back towards you

(2:09:55) rewind okay sorry so my view on this is because can you didn't let me

(2:10:02) finish I look I do want to have the back and forth I'm just going to no just let me say my whole view because I have a

(2:10:08) reason to be here let me finish um there's power dynamics that don't

(2:10:14) work right so my plan is is because our

(2:10:20) economy where it is now is we need both people working to sustain a household

(2:10:25) for most people so if we work together and buy acres of land we don't need to do

(2:10:31) that it sounds like we still have jobs what do you what does that mean like tell me why you're

(2:10:40) laughing well I mean you want so you want to buy these acres of land so that people have like housing and stuff like

(2:10:46) my close friends like three people like three families together do you want to tell her what is

(2:10:52) smok can you tell me what that means no like I don't know like he's

(2:10:59) going way to smoke I don't know what that means so you're a Comm not libertarian how am I a commun we have

(2:11:05) jobs still we just share money as family yeah I don't think you're I don't think you're commun I don't think what you're

(2:11:11) describing as a political ideology is no it's not a political ideolog ideology to because we're in

(2:11:19) such a weird state in society and the economy that we share resources of people that we love and care about like

(2:11:25) our family and brothers and sisters like how is that communism we still have jobs

(2:11:31) and well you still have jobs in communism we just share our assets with

(2:11:38) our family is that communism I know he wants to move on so okay let's move on all right you said uh basically you

(2:11:44) don't want to be anywhere near PE near people who are willing to keep doing things that divide us as a nation

() 

(2:11:50) instead of solving the real issues kind of like feminism um it's not it's just in

(2:11:55) general um can you just tilt your mic down a little bit like perfect okay um

(2:12:00) you said that you wanted some time to think about coming on the show you have bigger things going on in your life than this stupid podcast you don't know if

(2:12:06) it's worth it for you to go out of your way and spend your money to come be on the show and tell your views to brainwash people so is it who's

(2:12:13) brainwashed like the other girls me Andrew who's the viewers who's brainwash I just think the debate style can be

(2:12:20) kind of brainwashed ing sometimes um and I just think um if 70%

(2:12:27) of women are divorcing men why is a whole show based on hold on that's a

(2:12:34) different thing stick to the brainwashing no that is brainwashing what's brainwashing you're

(2:12:39) getting women who are prone to um uh

(2:12:45) with no education in the real world uh prone what do you mean by no education in the real world what does that mean

(2:12:51) people who are damaged mentally and emotionally coming on the show who are strippers and stuff are and men who are

(2:12:59) also mentally emotionally okay so we can just talk about like the if you want to

(2:13:04) do like an appeal to the the this exception what exception okay so we already established that 85% of our

(2:13:11) guests are not involved in sex work it's not just the guests it's the viewers they're not involved in sex work either

(2:13:16) no they're prone if they have on one thing at a time said bringing on on the show who have no education and they're

(2:13:23) being brainwashed and who they they have like trauma in their past first off I don't know a lot of people who haven't

(2:13:29) gone through some degree of like a traumatic experience in their past but like what evidence do you actually have

(2:13:34) that it's the case that the majority of our guests have like severe trauma I didn't say that so am I not allowed to

(2:13:41) speak to people who have gone through difficult things in their past that's great that you do um but what but what evidence do you have that that's that I

(2:13:48) the people hold on hold on what evidence do you have cuz I'm going to just reject

(2:13:53) your assertion immediately that the people who come on are disproportionately like have like a ton

(2:14:00) of trauma Dy issues and y'all yourself in the show listen listen you and

(2:14:07) yourself and and not you uh every time there's a woman that is in sex work or

(2:14:13) strippers they're like yeah there was no dad like you can y are the ones that make that assumptions yourselves

(2:14:21) they didn't come in normal households so cool let's go ahead I'm going to just grant that yes well I don't even yes sex

(2:14:28) workers do come on the show why don't we put that aside because I've already established that it's 15% of the guests

(2:14:33) that we've ever had on are involved in sex work there's no sex work workers on this panel yeah explain to me the

(2:14:39) component of brainwashing okay I I'm saying that um the more you view a video

(2:14:44) the the more you're going to get that type of content right so um if someone's

(2:14:50) damaged and they just got a guy let's just say a guy got cheated on and got like someone stole from them they're

(2:14:56) going to view more of those videos and if you have women that are no no no hey

(2:15:01) those aren't can you those aren't for you guys okay can you can you just get like normal water the alkaline water is

(2:15:08) too [Music]

(2:15:14) expensive can just there's there's bottle wat waterers there's the the water over there okay yeah I thought

(2:15:20) that was bot water there's the Kirklands all right go ahead

(2:15:25) oh yeah I don't know what I was saying yeah I don't I have ad can you speak into the M I have ADHD I don't remember

(2:15:30) what we were talking about talking about you're alleging that I am talking to uh

(2:15:35) people who are brainwashed oh I'm not saying just you I think you're contributing to a large factor of social

(2:15:43) media brainwashing it's not just your show in general I think in um I think

(2:15:48) okay what am I doing that's brainwashing generalizing women what have I done that's generalizing women you say women

() 

(2:15:55) all the time women do this women do that maybe it's true what there's no statistics on that maybe it's true what

(2:16:01) have I generalized um hold on yeah let her let

(2:16:06) me think while she speaks no it's your position justify your position what are

(2:16:13) you generalizing um just that women um care about money or status and stuff and

(2:16:19) not about What specifically have I said pertaining to that oh um I've never

(2:16:25) think I've called a woman a gold digger on the show never called did I ever I didn't say that you're saying did I say

(2:16:32) you're saying that men are protectors and providers no we and you don't say anything about connection and qualities

(2:16:39) that we want I don't care about a man's money and if you look at the

(2:16:44) comments yeah you're totally strawmanning my position what's my position I know strawman is you're misre

(2:16:50) okay how about this you're representing my position I I didn't say your position I just mean said you said I generalize

(2:16:55) about women and that they all they care about is money never have women do this women do that women like this but it's

(2:17:03) really not women generally like tall men is that like misog that's true no that's

(2:17:08) true oh that's true but it's a generalization so is it wrong no that one's not wrong okay so there's a lot of things

(2:17:15) you do like do I have wrong you make things very transactional that we expect

(2:17:21) for you to pay for everything um like you bring on girls that do expect that because they're very transactional

(2:17:28) people the majority of women don't feel that way we is that your position no I we understand as a normal person Society

(2:17:35) I understand that ah so normal women if they want a guy to pay for a first date

(2:17:40) that's like not normal behavior for not in today's society wow you're completely wrong completely wrong I I don't think

(2:17:47) it's it's a lot it's it's the majority of conservative women's position conservative one third of the population

(2:17:54) relationship hold on hold on it's the majority of conservative women's positions that they want men to pay for

(2:18:00) first AIDS this is just indisputable and then even liberal women who have perhaps

(2:18:05) a greater tendency towards being okay with a 50/50 relationship even liberal Progressive women want men they want

(2:18:12) chivalry they want tradition on the men's part and they want men to pay for first AIDS I don't think it's as much as

(2:18:17) conservative women but to just say all liberal women are all aggressive women don't want to go 50/50 is just

(2:18:23) completely dubious yeah no I'm not saying all of anything I'm saying you generalize people like it's a majority

(2:18:30) um any I think the I I don't know if it's a majority stics it's not majority

(2:18:36) I think if I don't know if there's polls on this but I would I think hold on hold on I do think it's a fair to say that I

(2:18:43) look I'd have to see the poll but I think it's fair idea going into a date like a lot of women do have an

(2:18:48) expectation that men that's the majority for sure like I haven't seen the peer reviewed study that like oh do women

(2:18:55) want men to pay for first AIDS I look at the sky it's plue there are well like

(2:19:01) there are they do definitely let's bring those up they definitely I'm just saying um yeah it's just don't generalize all

(2:19:08) the population if it's not it's 80% it's not not all I've never made say the word

(2:19:15) women so many times on the show like let me how about this how about this you said women do this when and do that

(2:19:21) that's what I have a problem with hold on well hold on I typically don't actually make that claim but hold on do you ever say the word they wait wait

(2:19:27) wait hold on hold on so like they like they did X yeah sometimes yeah so then

(2:19:33) all you're doing is you're making a reference to a specific group in the context you're talking about I'll

(2:19:39) explain so if you if you bring up women right if you say well what I've noticed is that and so let's say Brian qualifies

(2:19:47) what most women will do is they want X let's just say they want X for the rest of the conversation he

(2:19:53) can say the word women because we now have the reference to what he's talking about yeah I mean that's still the same

(2:19:59) thing if you put they then if you say women want can I ask your question the same thing yeah but if you qualify it

(2:20:04) first so we could do this with anything let's say if I say firefighters firefighters put out fires for the rest

(2:20:11) of this entire conversation if I say they I'm referencing what firefighters

(2:20:18) right so if he qualifies I'll explain so if he qualifies conversation at first and says well most

(2:20:24) women will do X the whole rest of the time he's referencing women in the source of that conversation he's

(2:20:30) referencing that most women X yeah but I what I disagree is when you

(2:20:36) say most women I don't agree with that like that it's most women in my world

(2:20:41) the things that you say I don't think I've said most women want men to pay for first AIDS in a previous

(2:20:47) podcast I'm not saying that in general I never said that that I said it I never

(2:20:53) said no I never said that you said that did I isn't that what we're arguing about I'm say no I'm saying in general

(2:20:58) you say women do this women want this when I don't believe that's the case

(2:21:04) what's not the case I don't remember the exact like I have AG if you bring up the

(2:21:10) topics I can tell you uh women wanting men to pay for First Dates yeah I I

(2:21:16) agree that a lot of them do I would say it's 50/50 but if I say like women if I say women

(2:21:23) likes men who are taller than them that's true do you think I'm referencing every woman on plan no I agree the

(2:21:29) majority what is this critique I think what is this critique listen I think in a lot of the times when you say you're

(2:21:37) generalizing things that aren't true I'd say that men yeah that General generalization about men I mean women

(2:21:44) liking tall men that's true but a lot of generalization do you take issue with I

(2:21:50) I don't remember if you bring it up I will but okay um here so I have ADHD I mean well I was asking you you were

(2:21:57) alleging that uh I brainwash people I think I didn't say you in general or brainwashing your mic down please let's

(2:22:03) just try to leave it where it is I didn't move it um no I yeah most of my issues on the show is you yeah my entire

(2:22:11) job is to convince people of my worldview yeah and it's and I really want to do that for the world no I think

(2:22:16) it is good for the world and your point of view and women shouldn't have rights but in my point of view yeah okay well

(2:22:23) my point of view is that women shouldn't have rights or that most people shouldn't have the right to vote I think

(2:22:29) first of all no no I want you to tell me my what my actual view is I think your view is because uh men are drafted that

(2:22:39) women shouldn't have the right to vote I think women should be drafted what's the just what's the justification of what of why it is that

(2:22:46) if men are drafted women shouldn't be able to vote what's the justification because uh to vote they have to sign

(2:22:53) sign off to be in the draft right that's not the justification you're incorrect about my position my position is that

(2:23:00) people shouldn't be able to vote to send people off to Wars they themselves will never be qualified to fight you say

(2:23:07) qualified can I bring up something like if you can't be drafted I think you vote

() 

(2:23:13) to send people off to war then you are participating in being able to send people off to war to fight a war that

(2:23:19) you yourself could never be eligible to fight let me say is that true or false that's true but let

(2:23:24) me totally F I'm not saying true in everything you're saying I'm saying um

(2:23:30) first of all combat has changed so much oh there's technology there's drones

(2:23:36) there's not oneon-one compact uh combat like it used to be yes

(2:23:41) there is not as much yeah all you got to do is look at Ukraine and Russia yes there is you're wrong you got to be you

(2:23:47) got to be switching you got to be switching um yeah that's that that's the US US has higher technology than that

(2:23:53) first of all we gave them our bad technology but no we them good technology okay yeah we gave them drone

(2:23:59) technology they have both sides have drone technology do you know how the Russians defeated Ukrainian drone technology they they brought back the

(2:24:06) draon what they did was they got on a motorcycle that goes really really fast with shotguns and take down drones that

(2:24:11) way Frontline combat Frontline combat is still men with guns killing each other

(2:24:16) it hasn't changed since World War II yeah but um when you say front line women who are controlling all other

(2:24:22) aspects there's not like a um back in the day where someone starts here and someone starts there and then we charged

(2:24:28) it's just like that it's like a big giant uh the map is huge women are

(2:24:34) getting uh it's always been that way and I think a big giant 600 like women died

(2:24:41) it was like one3 listen out it was onethird people were women where I don't remember I

(2:24:49) statistic nowhere there's nowhere ever that one of the combat troops were women

(2:24:55) who died that's insane and 1200 were men where I I don't remember are you talking

(2:25:02) about a battle or are you talking about the actual casualties you okay casual no casualties in an entire War I think it

(2:25:08) was Afghanistan like 600 women died in in

(2:25:13) what war are you talking about I think it was yeah with Afghanistan uh Iraq

(2:25:20) Afghanistan Iraq what the whole oil and Ben Laden do you think that we had 600

(2:25:26) women who were front line troops who front line no I'm not saying front line I mean they were in the map of the front

(2:25:34) line I know where we're even arguing this it's like these are volunteer female soldiers females can't be

(2:25:41) drafted okay so what they're volunteers can be drafted that's his position they should be drafted women should be

(2:25:47) drafted they can control the drones and everything else that doesn't mean we shouldn't have rights but they're not

(2:25:53) currently well we should change that that's what I'm here for is to change for the better not to just make everyone

(2:26:00) poiz on you're right hang on I was hang on yeah during the Afghanistan war 13 US service members died were females no I

(2:26:08) don't I'm not the right on the war whatever I looked up with 600 I'm not a history buff 13 no I'm not a history

(2:26:16) buff there probably the wrong 13 different than it's the wrong War dude I'm not a history puff like you I don't

(2:26:23) all I know is a something where 600 women out of yeah it was it's the wrong

(2:26:28) I have to look it up yeah but I mean so think of it from my are dying how many men died compared to women in that look

(2:26:35) up that uh I don't think that's that would be all that would be all other deaths how many deaths though total

(2:26:42) thousands of of of you want to get into Cas when you to get into casualties I think it's over 100,000 casualties

(2:26:50) meaning I got a leg blown off got an arm blown off so what happens in war is this yes what happens in war is this so if

(2:26:57) you go from World War I to World War II and you're taking a look at deaths versus casualties there was a lot of deaths to casualty ratio you go to World

(2:27:03) War II medical technology advanced there's still tons of casualties but not quite as many deaths to casualty ratio

(2:27:10) you go forward to Vietnam same thing go forward to Iraq Afghanistan you still have tens of thousands of casualties

(2:27:17) right I think there's over 100,000 casualties can I can look it up but the thing is is uh ultimately medical

(2:27:24) technology has come so far that if you get your arm and leg blown off and shrapnel all over you and you get burned you still live but you're still a

(2:27:30) casualty of War maybe the that was the statistic was casualties how how am I

(2:27:36) brainwashing people I didn't say you were brainwashing I think the whole red pelt

(2:27:41) like thing is it's it's making hate women hate you and Men hate us what if

(2:27:47) it's made the right kind of women hate me like I want feminists to hate me because um they should why because U I

(2:27:55) represent an ideology which literally wants to destroy feminism should you try to help them change whatever Viewpoint

(2:28:02) or or you mean by like I don't know debating with them repulse them debating with

(2:28:08) them how how how should I how could two people enter into an oppositional

(2:28:13) discourse with each other in a way that would convince other people of their ideology what would be a thing you can

(2:28:18) think of off the top of your head that could do that sorry I I blinked out you said opposition is yeah yeah so I'll try

(2:28:24) I'll try this again what what could two people do through the through the course of if you wanted to have discourse with

(2:28:30) him with opposition views in order to convince a ton of other people of your position what is the single word that

(2:28:37) comes to your mind that two people could do to do that it's debate but your views are taking away women's rights and you

(2:28:44) no you think that Comm okay I do want to have the back and forths here ah

(2:28:50) your view is that things were better in the 50s when

(2:28:55) women look I I'll give you time women could vote in the50s the 19th amendment pass 1920 I'm talking about you you said

(2:29:03) on the show that women were happier in the 50s I I don't believe that you guys I will give you guys time later on in

(2:29:10) the show to discuss this I need to get through the notes though okay so you I you still haven't really explained to me

(2:29:17) the whole brainwashing component but we'll save that for the end you said you think that the show is just as

() 

(2:29:22) harmful as only fans on society yeah social media is uh is um like I said

(2:29:30) many times that we're making women more repulsive men and men more repulsive women okay so I'm going to just repeat

(2:29:37) what you said you said that you think the show is just as harmful as only fans

(2:29:43) on society so I have a couple couple clarifying questions same sure um can you articulate precise nicely how my

(2:29:50) show is harmful to start because if you look at the comments and the feeds there's a lot of hate there's a lot of

(2:29:57) hate and um I think that all of the comments and all the people that come

(2:30:02) through it yeah it's lot of very hateful I'll get to the comment section so and

(2:30:10) and I'll address the comparison of it to the harm women are doing the same thing yeah hold on so I do think you seem to

(2:30:17) greatly overestimate the reach and influence that I have that the show has so yeah whatever podcast more harmful

(2:30:24) than only fans in totality in its entirety I didn't say it was more harmful I said it just as harmful oh

(2:30:31) just okay excuse me just as harmful um I I'm not saying a you populations like it

(2:30:37) has to be exact equal or one has a higher population um cuz I don't know the statistics I just mean that only

(2:30:44) fans is also being harmful towards men and women sure okay

(2:30:50) so um are you like in favor of adult content creation consumption no sex work

(2:30:56) okay no um so I'd like to quantify this so my show which gets I mean now we're actually have about 10,000 live viewers

(2:31:03) but typically we're like 500,000 or sorry 5,000 to 7,000 live viewers um

(2:31:09) 10,000 Awesome by the way yeah thank you guys for uh tuning in five but the average is between 5,000

(2:31:16) to 7,000 live viewers um more harmful or sorry excuse me I not it's not more

(2:31:22) harmful just as harmful to society as only fans which is a multi-billion doll

(2:31:27) international company which has introduced millions of women to sex work who wouldn't have otherwise done it not

(2:31:34) to mention the harm that this is doing not just to women but also to men for a variety of reasons but one of these

(2:31:40) reasons that I tend to harp on quite a bit is the whole like you know the Casual defrauding that's occurring on

(2:31:45) only fans when it comes to uh and these sort of girlfriend exper fake experiences there's a lot of fraud going

(2:31:52) on um whatever podcast Ju Just as

(2:31:57) harmful as not just I think the whole rep like the whole um it's not it's just

(2:32:02) the whole red pill not saying you're exactly red pill I just mean the whole movement in general is I'm not

(2:32:08) interested in it's just say like one only fan girl vers whatever podcast you

(2:32:13) can't just say the whole of one thing the whole of the other thing I'll repeat what you wrote cuz that's what I'm

(2:32:19) contending with you said I think your show is just as harmful as only fans on

(2:32:25) society so I'm not going to do a defense of other podcasts I'm my own person I

(2:32:31) don't know what other people are doing I have my platform that's what I meant I have my platform I have my PO oh that's

(2:32:37) what you meant here are your words once again I'll repeat them back to you I think your show is just as harmful as

(2:32:44) only fans on society in general with all the other so how am I supposed to interpret when somebody says so so for

(2:32:50) example if I said you commit a crime and then I say oh no it's actually like just

(2:32:55) it's just like white people I was talking about white people what oh my God okay I'm not responsible for anybody

(2:33:03) besid you are responsible for you yeah that's right your show you said your show I think your show is just as

(2:33:10) harmful as only fans which is a multibillion international yeah just as

(2:33:15) harmful okay not just you and your 200,000 views or whatever I just mean

(2:33:21) every other podcast I'm not affiliated with other what like you are putting that out there and they're watching your

(2:33:26) videos I'm put yes I'm putting my worldview out there and yeah that's that's the point that

(2:33:32) yeah it's bad for society is it or is it not bad for society that's good for well you could and your

(2:33:38) Viewpoint not not his view I'll go ahead and Grant not your Viewpoint not yeah

(2:33:45) I'm going to go ahead and Grant that my podcast is bad for society how the [ __ ]

(2:33:50) do you come to the conclusion that it's just as harmful okay sayans I'll say I

(2:33:56) was wrong in that but it's very harmful it's I'd say it's pretty not just you but the whole narrative I don't care

(2:34:02) about the other people stick to the stick to just show I will succeed in that no but I'd say this whole my point

(2:34:08) is not just you in general I'd say these types of podcasts is what I meant by that no I'm going to take your words at

(2:34:15) face value I think show I said I'm wrong if you're taking by face value but that's what I I'm not prepared to do a

(2:34:20) defense of other podcasts I'll defend my show I told you I was wrong if you're taking it by face value but what I meant

(2:34:27) by that it's different than what I said okay sure and so your position is because looking at the comments on my

(2:34:33) videos and other similar ones it's really frightening there's a lot of hate that's being spread yeah in the comments

(2:34:38) or my my own rhetoric and positions or is it just the comments no you're not that bad I just mean okay but but okay

(2:34:46) but okay but the comments are really no no it's I think that yeah people who have been hurt like if you tell them if

(2:34:54) you spread stuff that makes them want to hate women more they're more prone to

(2:34:59) you you you know what say well well I'm not going to grant that but so just curious so okay the comments are really

(2:35:05) bad you know what I agree I do want to ask though so is this like your first day on the internet like

(2:35:12) this isn't something that's exclusive to the hold on no just let me finish this is not something that's exclusive to the

(2:35:18) whatever podcast you can go watch a Minecraft video and on the Minecraft

(2:35:23) video there's going to be like ridiculous comments on a Minecraft video this is just you know YouTube comment

(2:35:30) section kind of just notorious for being bad but honestly have you seen the Tik

(2:35:35) Tok comment section which I I go on Tik Tok that's fine I think TP Tik Tok which is absolutely dominated by women I look

(2:35:42) at the uh comment sections on a lot of uh Fe like female Centric uh Tik toks

(2:35:49) that are often dating related and off the the mandry and man-hating and sexist

(2:35:54) comments I see on there is uh pretty objectionable but I guess what I'm trying to say is this is not something

(2:36:00) that's purely exclusive just the whatever you're adding to it just well I

(2:36:05) mean I think no matter what you do like there are going to be nasty comments and

(2:36:11) if you're in a field like dating if you're talking about dating if you're talking about relationships especially

(2:36:16) if you talk about politics that's it comes with the territory people are going to say nasty things things in the

(2:36:23) comment what I can tell you is I'm responsible for what I say that's my view as a man I'm only responsible for

(2:36:29) the words that I say I AG some guy in the comment section who says some crazy [ __ ] I agree I'm you are responsible for

(2:36:38) that but you also own like this is your show and you put these comments on but

(2:36:44) yeah um oh like the super chats oh yeah sometimes they're nasty they're nasty than me they call me fat

(2:36:51) makeit they say all kind of [ __ ] about me my big thing is that women should stop women hating and advertising that

(2:36:57) and men should stop okay yeah uh women should stop man hating and women should stop should we just take YouTube down

(2:37:04) because like the comment because because YouTube is no I get that so I think

(2:37:09) social media is bad for society should just because bad thing happen in society should maybe we should just end societ

(2:37:15) like should should I not have the podcast is that your gratification no I mean if if you agree it's bad for

(2:37:20) society then that was my point is that is bad for society and I yeah so it's

(2:37:25) good for society though good for society you and your Viewpoint yeah wait so let me ask you a question let me ask you a

(2:37:31) question so let's say uh you said you're like libertarian I mean I don't know the words I I I think she's walked that back

(2:37:37) or okay well you you um I don't care about social crap I I care about a small

(2:37:43) government I I don't believe in I'm just that's okay but so what is that a small

(2:37:48) government and okay so whatever your worldview is let's say there's like a representative of your worldview who has

(2:37:54) a YouTube channel right yeah and maybe it's a political figure and maybe he's forwarding all your political values

(2:38:01) your worldview Etc in the comment section on his YouTube channel there's like nasty comments and they're talk

(2:38:07) they're like saying nasty things about like the political opposition like maybe let's say it's a republican let's say you're a Republican and you like a

(2:38:14) republican candidate and in the comment section of his YouTube videos they're saying oh these Liberals are stupid and

(2:38:19) idiots and their big big mean faces whatever the mean things whatever the mean things they're saying in the comment section even though he's

(2:38:26) forwarding your world view should he stop doing it because like the mean comments on YouTube no but when you

(2:38:31) allow people on your show that don't like care about human rights and men are

(2:38:39) you know that makes difference I've never actually seen Brian put anybody on the show that doesn't care about human rights women's rights yeah I'm sorry I'm

(2:38:45) sorry you said human rights human rights is women's rights if I say that I think that men and women probably shouldn't

(2:38:51) both vote yeah I mean can you explain to me how it is that I'm singling out

(2:38:56) women because you don't want them to vote I think that they should also have to um but I'm how am I singling them out

(2:39:04) if I'm saying both shouldn't both shouldn't vote men and women shouldn't vote if I say that I want to go back to

(2:39:10) our constitutional founding where no one votes what constitutional founding or

(2:39:15) I'll let you guys have it but I I hold on sorry I that was confusing because these chats are about to fall off I

(2:39:21) don't want to repeat of what happened yesterday where where we weren't able to pull them off uh Lucas chair 2 also out

(2:39:26) of sure curiosity did you have these Looney Tunes views while you were married and if so did your ex have a man

() 

(2:39:32) bun and did he head up the local white dudes for Cala get out the the vote this is for you um did I have these Lon views

(2:39:40) when we were married um no My Views were more uh more liberal rather than uh

(2:39:46) leftist what was what was the other part just I think if you had the views while you're married and did your ex have a

(2:39:51) man bun no and did he was he like white dudes for Cala uh no he's he's not a

(2:39:57) liberal so okay it's a very very common post- divorce for women to go the feminist Marxist rout by the way we have

(2:40:04) Lucas here chair one you have nothing of substance to say you portray yourself as a squishy fence sitter which in and of

(2:40:10) itself is abhorent you're his historically illiterate and fail to understand that continued yeah there's

(2:40:16) three I mean I'm not just wait I'll read it I'll read just one sec one sec yeah I'm not a

(2:40:22) history societies were built on a Clash of ideas as far back as deanes for that

(2:40:27) matter this Clash of ideas was the very underpinning of the for the Socratic method and the paretic school sorry I I

(2:40:34) haven't heard that one before uh continued he has one more coming in from Lucas thank you man uh furthermore he

(2:40:40) furthermore our entire legal system especially at the appet level is grounded on adversarial argumentation

(2:40:46) and that's just some examples so quit your whining develop your ground principles I'm not whining first of all I think there should be more than a

(2:40:52) two-party system and that's okay yeah that's that sure all right based astronaut says two questions for all the

(2:40:59) women on the panel one do you believe in astrology two can you define what a civil war is so first off uh going

(2:41:05) around the table do you believe in astrology no no yeah yeah guys into the mic please no

(2:41:14) is it uh astrology is that like your science horc oh no okay all right and

(2:41:20) then uh can you define what a civil war is a war in a nation that's like half

(2:41:27) and half they're fighting for some sort of issue

(2:41:33) okay uh yeah two uh groups in the same country fighting War yeah correct okay

(2:41:40) um textbook definition no but um I guess we're like yeah we're too too parties

(2:41:49) are fighting I guess I don't think the rest of girls need that to answer um all right uh unless you guys want to weigh

(2:41:56) in on I just want to say thank gosh he said it first you know what I'm saying I think that's fine for a proprietary

(2:42:01) definition I think most people would probably say that that's okay what would come to most people's brains as two

(2:42:07) groups fighting in a nation Lucas and do so comprehensively and with granular detail and finally pick aide otherwise

(2:42:14) you're effectless lemming spewing nonsensical circular prattle Andrew was he F bat or M

(2:42:22) rothbard I think he's talking about the libertarian that couldn't think of oh no it wasn't what am I what is it called

(2:42:29) it's a guy it's the libertarian who always is talking about um how

(2:42:34) monarchies are actually better I can't think of his name off the top of my head he's like a short pudgy guy with glasses

(2:42:40) I just can't think of his name so me picking aide means that I'm worse than who what do he say that I'm worse than

(2:42:46) what oh that some chubby guy no he was asking me who I was thinking about earlier when I was

(2:42:53) referencing um the the guy was ref I just for some reason sometimes you have that like brain fog when you're trying

(2:43:00) to reference a specific person you can't think of it same I have that all the time yeah okay uh let's see we have Jason

(2:43:08) sorry for the delay on this Jason Jason Castle donated

(2:43:13) $200 chair one you are a effing idiot shut up dummy thank you Jason um let's

(2:43:21) see let's see what you look like Jason uh didn't we show him a pre we

(2:43:59) uh message man it's in it's in the works we're going to lose some weight boys we're we're all going to make it bro

(2:44:04) okay um finishing off here with I guess some of your notes uh you said uh okay

(2:44:09) we talked about like the comment section yeah comment's bad um you also wrote considering how much considering how

(2:44:17) much uh domestic violence there is in the world I don't think it is very healthy spread

(2:44:22) rhetoric about women to mentally damaged men there's aaims here uh what evidence

(2:44:28) do you have that the men who are watching the show are mentally damaged I think that I think that a lot of society

(2:44:33) is mentally damaged if they've been hurt by women same as women with men if if they're more in tune to like being

(2:44:40) hateful towards women I just are you a feminist just curious not really I don't

(2:44:46) I don't know you might be um maybe in your definition I don't really know okay um so can you explain what is the

(2:44:53) rhetoric precisely about women that were spreading the generalizations just generalizations about women caring about

(2:45:01) status and and money and and stuff like that like I don't care about a man

(2:45:07) protecting me I think that's rhetoric you don't care about the man protecting you I mean I'm an introverted woman that

(2:45:12) Gardens all day I don't need a man to protect me well I mean you do by proxy but why from other men sure why not that

(2:45:20) could I I don't need let me ask you a question that means I shouldn't be with a man right say you need men to protect you from men 90% of murders are

(2:45:26) committed by men so and like 90% of like in infant murders are committed by women

(2:45:31) cool yeah are committed by mothers okay cool true postpartum depression is okay

(2:45:37) let's just let's just allow women to murder their children because I'm not saying they should I'm not saying they should murder no I don't I don't agree

() 

(2:45:44) with abortion in most stances do you have any evidence that the men who watch my show are mentally Dam I think that uh

(2:45:51) not all of them I think a large portion of them if you look at the comments are mentally damaged with the hate the

(2:45:57) hatred like the hate comments they're saying just as if I see women saying crazy things about men I think that they

(2:46:03) should probably get some me comment section the comment section wouldn't even necessarily like people are

(2:46:09) inclined to leave comments that's like probably yeah they're the mentally ill ones thank you 10% of the audience maybe

(2:46:16) who even leaves comments most you got 100 bucks here that says this that Brian can pull up any random video

(2:46:21) he wants okay and the first 10 comments what they're probably okay how

(2:46:27) many comments do you I don't read all the comments I see the top ones where people are liking and then you can

(2:46:33) assume if they're liking all that that the other people agree with it so okay so so uh let's say this my00

(2:46:42) versus you leaving the show for what okay hang on my we got to get through

(2:46:48) I'm kidding you want me to leave the show all right all right1 we're not going to do we're not

(2:46:54) going to do any gambling on YouTube so I'll just put the 100 up against my I guess myself you get it if you're right

(2:47:00) and I get it back if I'm right so you don't you have to put up a steak so it's not even gambling right so Brian can

(2:47:06) pull up any random video go through the first 10 comments and I don't even think they'll be that

(2:47:12) bad I don't even think they'll be that bad which video any pick you pick okay

(2:47:17) let's see uh okay so here's I guess here's how we can do it do you want for the live randomized randomized live

() 

(2:47:23) stream yeah live stream randomized okay so here's what you're going to do Blake private chat I sent you the link to our

(2:47:28) YouTube page let's see the comments of today to hold on hold on see it just

(2:47:35) okay one second um hide streamyard I'll go fix it all right yeah yeah we'll just

(2:47:41) pick a random one I bet you the first 10 aren't even bad like the top ones are the most like recommended um there's the

(2:47:49) first 10 comments the ones that are the most liked I bet they're not even that bad

(2:47:57) okay but I'm just betting against me so I mean I I don't always read the

(2:48:02) comments All I know is just yeah you can pick the video every video I've done this do you know I've done this

(2:48:07) experiment dozens of times with callers who've called in and said that you can tell by the comments and I'm like okay

(2:48:13) pick any random video we go to the first 10 comments they're never that bad never

(2:48:19) just like their opinion of the show I think chair 6 was wrong about X well that's fine but when you scroll down

(2:48:25) there's a lot of hatred oh so out of thousands of comments some people say negative things I would say at least a third of them are pretty bad a third

(2:48:33) yeah that's a lot all right you want to do the gorlock episode here you want what gorlock oh I mean I've seen that

(2:48:40) one of course they going to call gorlock okay which one which one do you want

(2:48:45) which one um I don't know I I'm not just pick a random one don't picklock pick pick uh what's her

(2:48:52) name uh rage quit the one first the one after that pick that one all right

(2:48:59) sure go to the first 10

(2:49:09) comments oh you very tiny um p word is

(2:49:14) okay andw do you want to read the comments yeah it's it's um I'll make it

(2:49:19) yeah okay there we go so it starts with p p word's okay as

(2:49:25) long as I'm getting paid for it someone call the cops please that doesn't sound bad Hensley I don't like Asians girls

(2:49:30) woohoo you go girl Chase I don't date trans how dare you transphobic bigot doesn't sound bad to me I'm pretty sure

(2:49:36) I could talk to Nicolet for two hours straight and not learn a single useful thing again doesn't sound bad Kiko is the biggest hypocrite on planet Earth

(2:49:42) again doesn't sound bad Chase these girls would rather see women at 18 sell their bodies and guys online than get

(2:49:48) into caring and loving a monogamous relationship with an older guy this such a clear sign of how Society has fallen

(2:49:53) that's a bad how what's bad about that it's literally just his General opinion on what he's saying like this is bad

(2:50:00) it's crazy to me that these 18-year-olds would say this thing the next one is Chase is the guy who walks into the valley of death and fears no evil

(2:50:06) doesn't sound bad Nicollet is the perfect example of what every woman should avoid and why every man should

(2:50:12) avoid dating hard to know if you haven't seen the episode I agree with you yeah

(2:50:17) so none of these look bad none of these look bad I know I those people are not mentally ill oh not those people just

(2:50:23) everyone else 10 comments okay I hang on hang on do you know why this experiment

(2:50:30) works so well why are they the top comments cuz they're the most liked so if they're the most like that means the

(2:50:36) most amount of people are saying I agree with this person on this and if the top 10 are not mentally ill and the most

(2:50:43) amount of people are agreeing with them on the likes what can we figure out from that thank you I agree with you but no I

(2:50:50) I do agree with you on that point but also the mentally ill people on the show

(2:50:56) um I just think it's a generalization um that's unhealthy which girls here are mentally ill no one here that I know of

(2:51:03) that one girl that left I would say she's mentally ill yes yeah the most and maybe so the most

(2:51:10) lik comments are the ones that are least mentally ill no I would say she's not

(2:51:15) maybe mentally ill maybe there's a bit of dulu there delusion on who her and she's not there to defend herself so

(2:51:23) she's talking about the feminist I mean she's no the girl that's not here probably a bit more well spoken than

(2:51:31) she's well spoken yeah but the whole r word thing I would yeah I but the thing

(2:51:38) is is like I don't but yeah the girl leg ill she has a legate wellth thought out

(2:51:44) ideology whether you agree with it or don't agree with it which I don't right it's at least a legitimate ideology that

() 

(2:51:51) is well thought out and so therefore if it is legitimate and well thought out it runs like a social plague in people's

(2:51:58) minds so my job is to refute and destroy that ideology so that this plague cannot

(2:52:04) spread see my issue is when you have people like that person on the show it makes it seem like this is a normal

(2:52:11) generalized Viewpoint with women when you say a normal generalized Viewpoint for Marxist feminism in colleges I don't

(2:52:18) know what Marxist means so I don't know that yeah well you not having the requisite knowledge to know these

(2:52:24) ideologies are real and are prevalent has nothing to do with the fact that they actually are yeah they really

(2:52:30) actually are and they really actually need to be refuted I've never met anybody in in my existence of 37 years

(2:52:38) that have viewpoints like that so I just don't think it's that normal because

(2:52:43) well here's the thing you anecdotally saying to me well you know I haven't met anybody in 37 years who has views like

(2:52:50) this I've met people all over the world that have views like this cuz you debate people and y'all bring on people that

(2:52:55) are going to have good view when I would just to make bring views I've been paying attention to politics since I was

(2:53:01) like 16 in fact less than that I was riding around the car with my dad listening to Rush limbo on his car when

(2:53:07) I was a little kid okay I've been listening to these lunatics for years and years and years very few people

(2:53:13) combat their ideology and do it effectively just cuz you don't know it exists but at the same time you're like

(2:53:18) is decadent hang on hang on society is decadent is breaking down and I just want to leave and go in in a field and

(2:53:24) grow some [ __ ] food with my friends and Escape it's because nobody's combating the very ideologies that want

(2:53:30) you that you want to escape from and so somebody says okay well I'll battle that

(2:53:35) ideology the first thing you do is go how dare you no how dare you just because I don't know what the word m

(2:53:41) whatever word you said I don't think the general population knows what that means Jason Castle donated $200 there two

(2:53:46) other chats after this you are so dumb make a clever insult I insulted you by

(2:53:52) attacking your intellect essentially calling BS on your claim of having a 140

(2:53:58) plus IQ it's true show me your picture LOL WTF show me your picture of L thank

(2:54:04) you Jason Cassell for the uh message I do appreciate we have show me your picture we have two more coming in thank

(2:54:22) married to women way out of your league in every way continued to which he says

(2:54:28) oh hold on there's another one that kind of got interrupted by this Lucas so there's also a lot of husbands and wives

(2:54:33) who watch show TP Bri hold on Brian stop stop Brian and Andrew are like Rome and

(2:54:39) chair one got the Carthage treatment chair five here's a little diddy Sarah

(2:54:44) Sarah Storms are brewing in your eyes Sarah Sarah no time is a good time for

(2:54:49) goodbyes that's a poem for you I guess okay and then Lucas continued saying

(2:54:55) including looks wise we don't hate women we hate your kind of woman finally if you want to talk [ __ ] find me on X and

(2:55:00) how me wife look same username tell me if I would even look at you if I was

(2:55:06) single okay Lucas um my response is first of all you said I was insulting I

(2:55:12) haven't really insulted anyone I don't think um um and what is my type of

(2:55:17) person person hold on hold on hold on you said Bri's podcast is more evil than only fans pretty big insult I say it was

(2:55:23) more evil just as social media social media I'd say

(2:55:30) no mod daily is this a mod daily like oh let me forward this like completely

(2:55:36) contentious position now let me walk it back because it's back you literally are

(2:55:41) saying no you're okay you're this podcast is viewed all I'm not even on

(2:55:48) the same Viewpoint and I see this podcast all the time that's cool so you're popular I don't watch only fans

(2:55:56) what I'm just saying it's pretty popular and like it's spreading like Andre I'm

(2:56:01) not saying you're bad at Andrew Tate I'm saying there's this there is rhetoric and it is being spread and we're making

(2:56:08) us more and more repulsed by each other and I'm trying to help that out so I want there to be a fix cool you want

(2:56:15) there to be a fix so my show is a response to the overreaches of feminism

(2:56:21) look the reality is I'm not going to go on some long monologue as I've gone on before on this but you have to

(2:56:27) understand feminism has its clause in pretty much every single realm of society the people who are speaking like

(2:56:32) me who are talking out like in when it comes to anti-feminist rhetoric we are the minority we are the counterculture

(2:56:38) the mainstream is feminism and it's not just like culturally culturally or socially mainstream it's backed up and

(2:56:46) propped up by every single system system and institution in this country you have the university system these these

(2:56:52) universities with billion doll million doll endowments you think I have influence with my little podcast here

(2:56:59) trust me the feminist studies and gender studies and all the These Arms of NOS

(2:57:05) NOS the university system billions of and there's you it's interesting you

(2:57:11) talk about brain only stop stop let me make my point so you have women who go

(2:57:17) into these universities mind you every single University or college in this country has a woman studies a gender

(2:57:22) studies or a feminist studies yes it does no I'm saying stupid I'm saying that's stupid they should but it does

(2:57:28) and there needs to be a counternarrative because if you want to you these these uh students these young adults are

(2:57:35) paying thousands tens of thousands even six figures at a very young impressionable age and you think I'm

(2:57:43) brainwashing my predominantly like 20 to 30y old male audience some you know it's

(2:57:48) actually I think 25 the demographic is 25 to 34 35 to 50 uh excuse me 4 44 you

(2:57:55) have 18-year-old women who are like often times required to take like a feminist studies course like as some

(2:58:01) sort of like General class or something I don't think they're required doesn't matter there's like tutorials like they

(2:58:07) get brainwashed in other ways that's brainwashing that's brainwashing at the institutional systemic level nobody's

(2:58:14) forced to watch my show nobody's forced to come on my show so you have the university level billion dollar endowments at all these universities

(2:58:20) that feminist studies program then you have corporations feminism is absolutely sunk into corporations then you have

(2:58:27) journalism seeped into journalism you have the news seeped there it's in the entertainment industry Hollywood is

(2:58:33) absolutely in the grasp of feminism and then you have the government yes even in the government feminism has seeped its

(2:58:40) claws into that too so this idea this idea that my podcast is doing is doing

(2:58:48) any sort of harm when I have 5,000 viewers on average when that no I mean

(2:58:54) it live live you have 5,000 viewers yeah I I understand that my reach is greater

(2:58:59) than my live audience but this idea that like oo this one really bad podcast is

(2:59:05) like talking about like men's rights issues and disagreeing with women whereas here let me ask you look men you

(2:59:12) have I'll make it super simple listen men's issues is important but the way yall go about it is not

(2:59:18) ites females no no sometimes it's repulsive like you're generalizing women

(2:59:24) I do care about men's rights okay which ones yeah that's

() 

(2:59:30) right I dude I'm not I was about to answer you're laughing at me I do I

(2:59:37) think that women should be drafted if there's going to be a draft that's not aent right that's how women's that's how women's is Equalization that has nothing

(2:59:43) to do with men's rights what about what about men What men's rights do you care about what no I agree about men being

(2:59:50) okay and what I'm doing what men's rights do you care about nothing you have nothing men and

(2:59:56) women's rights I care about nothing have nothing men don't have any rights other than being drafted that aren't

(3:00:02) interesting okay interesting okay you had something oh and no I I do agree

(3:00:08) hold on I want to let her in for a little bit I know that Obama made it so that y'all could get um the baby

(3:00:13) changers in mail bathrooms as well for husbands so that could put a positive

(3:00:20) energy to being a father and enact that law so that they could be positive and

(3:00:26) that's a right for a man to be able to take care of his kid in the bathroom like a woman in my opinion okay I do

(3:00:32) agree there are some things I do think that there should be a fraternity test

() 

(3:04:32) name I don't do friends with benefits I heart tips and Subs Graham honey t103 y'all get that if we not going on a date

(3:04:39) don't swipe right cuz y' already know um I like to roller skate if you broke I'm not the woman for you cuz I do not go

(3:04:46) 50/50 my biggest um Flex is I got poetry published and

(3:04:52) being an award-winning promo model um for 20 friendly and um I don't smoke

(3:04:58) nicotine and I like to be in charge shopping and double dates and cliff jumping and my favorite type of dates

(3:05:06) are my favorite types of dates and outings um yep I already said that I don't go wait so just a couple questions

(3:05:11) here so you don't go 50/50 love yes but you like to be in charge so like when you say you like to be in charge what

(3:05:18) like what does that mean like you got to do what I tell you to do um wait can you just I'm going to

(3:05:24) adjust your mic can you like straighten it like this okay so when you say you're going to tell the guy to do you going to

(3:05:32) do what I tell you to do like give me an example um if I'm hungry and you tell me you're

(3:05:39) not doing anything you should probably go give me food and I'mma wait and see if he'll he

(3:05:46) you know offer cuz you know pretty princess hungry but okay yeah if not

(3:05:51) I'mma tell her but sometimes you know what else should a guy do should he pay your should pay I should have to should

(3:05:57) he pay your rents should he pay your bills um bills bills no that's probably going to come when I'm like engaged or married or something cuz I I can handle

(3:06:04) it myself I feel like maybe if my career

(3:06:11) wasn't so much fun and I didn't love doing it as much I would depend on a man more for that cuz sure getting money to

(3:06:18) do what I I actually you know what I don't know if this is even a contradiction because you said you like simps but you want to be in charge so

(3:06:24) you want a guy to be provide but not from a position of like he's like really masculine he's a provider he's going to

(3:06:31) take the lead you want it to be from like a more subservient like he's a s and you're

(3:06:38) going to boss him around yeah but also there's a negative connotation with

(3:06:44) like the word simp the reason I like to use it is because it scares a man a away that isn't going to put in any type of

(3:06:50) effort or be there to listen or who is only there to want to have sex you know

(3:06:55) so um what wait when you tell man I like simps I like men who are going to do

(3:07:02) what I want who worship the ground I walk on do this this is and that worship worship the ground you walk on okay

(3:07:08) would you say like Gomez Adams is a s I can't remember who that is was that

(3:07:14) from Adam from Adam's Family oh wow did I just myself no I know who that is

(3:07:20) which Adams Family variation uh the r Julia op par which one is it which one

(3:07:25) is that I don't know what else what like decade um probably '90s okay mhm yeah

(3:07:32) would you say Gomez Adams is a s yeah okay like I just want my man obsessed with me like maybe she hasn't seen that

(3:07:39) version Perhaps Perhaps um so wait so okay guy you want a guy to go not go

(3:07:46) 50/50 you want want to pay for stuff you want to S but you also want to be in

(3:07:52) charge and he has to worship the ground you walk on yeah so when you say in charge like you're going to make the

(3:07:58) first move and stuff um probably not I would say maybe you

(3:08:04) know I'm not going to say nothing but I'll like a look so he has to do a VI

(3:08:09) like they'll be a Vibe you know what I'm saying change the split so wasn't Patricia Adams a virgin

(3:08:16) though so mortisha Adams mortisha sorry put pretty confident since the show ran

(3:08:22) back in the 50s that that's how it was portrayed right don't think in the movies that I bet you would know the 50s

(3:08:28) rendition better than I would so I don't know so you're saying men should only for virgins no no I'm just saying like

(3:08:35) it makes more sense that he was way into her that's all I mean some sometimes like you I think men can tell when a

(3:08:42) woman has more going for herself than like other women like

(3:08:49) you want to be in charge but the guy has to take all the initiative he has to make the first move he has to go for the first kiss he has to move things forward

(3:08:55) he has to pay for dates do you want do you want chivalry too yeah like most huh like you want a

(3:09:02) guy to like open you want the guy to like open the car door be a gentleman maybe you want

(3:09:08) flowers not really okay no flowers that's fine you want a guy to open the car door maybe pull out your seat for

(3:09:13) you to sit in would you guy would you want a guy like if a guy another guy disrespected you on a date would you

(3:09:19) want him to like fight you on or sorry not fight you fight the other guy maybe

(3:09:24) not fight cuz like I I don't want like any repercussions for them personally like legally or anything but I would

(3:09:31) definitely want them to stand their ground talk to the person who's running the establishment like do all that extra

(3:09:37) stuff to defend your honor right but I'm not I would say that could definitely lead that could definitely lead to

(3:09:43) violence if somebody defends right but not the gentle giant that I love and well I mean how's he going to defend

(3:09:48) your honor if it doesn't risk offing making sure he lead a premises and there's a freaking repercussion right so

(3:09:54) then that could lead to violence for him no we can't if you go to somebody like what are you talking about if somebody's

(3:10:00) disrespecting me publicly they're causing a public disturbance so they're going to [ __ ] freaking leave am I

(3:10:06) allowed to say f yeah it's okay okay so yeah they're they're going to they're going to leave yeah but what I'm saying is that whatever guy you're with he goes

(3:10:12) over to a guy and he's like hey you don't talk to my girl like hang on hang hang on hang on you don't talk to my

(3:10:18) girl like that that does put him at risk of bodily harm the second he does that yeah well I feel like that's also does

(3:10:27) but want to put do that but it puts him at risk to do it right it does yeah

(3:10:32) that's Brian's Point okay yeah that's pretty good valid point I guess but most

(3:10:37) men want to stick up for their woman and be um you said that the word simp being abused and ruining love mhm so men

() 

(3:10:45) should be simps mhm guess how how are we defining s like sucker idolizing mediocre [ __ ]

(3:10:50) oh I didn't know that was a AC oh I didn't know that's what that's what it means that's crazy mean sucker idolizing

(3:10:57) mediocre [ __ ] I've never had anybody tell me that but I don't think it's I don't

(3:11:03) really that's the I think he made that up I feel like some urban

(3:11:09) Dictionary what it means that's where it came from I think so that's crazy I I promise you that's what it means but

(3:11:15) what was the question well so I guess mov on to the next thing you said that you you like modern dating and you hate it at the same time because when you

(3:11:22) were on Bumble you've had like 4,000 potential matches and out of those 4,000 only 200 reached your standards so I

(3:11:29) think that's 5% if my math is right so like only 4,000 matches only uh 200 of

(3:11:36) them reached your standards so what are your standards um they're kind

(3:11:43) of I want to say no come on tall it's tall and rich

(3:11:49) no tall is one intelligence is another one I'd say like hustle and drive

(3:11:55) is it doesn't even have to be rich it's like the the first man I ever how much let me talk I just want to know how much

(3:12:02) cuz I asked you questions you answer not my question how much how much does he need make it don't matter right now it

(3:12:08) don't matter cuz I'm making my own bread it's if he can take care of me like it's not even it's not even like what you're

(3:12:14) making cuz I'm not moving in with you or being engaged yet right now it's like how much are you willing to invest in me

(3:12:20) as a person not as like what you making in a year cuz I really don't care cuz the first that me just like give me a

(3:12:26) sandwich and [ __ ] like that I mean give me a sandwich like I put on there take me shopping cliff jumping trips there's

(3:12:32) other things you could do to show a woman that you care about her if he takes you shopping you pay h no well

(3:12:37) then well then he has to make something what do you mean how is he going to take you shopping without money I'm trying to

(3:12:43) tell you there's no limit on it for me because the amount don't matter for minimum the

(3:12:50) minimum yeah yeah like if if I feel like to take probably take it take over at

(3:12:56) least 120k a year to do what the things I like to do and you expect him to pay

(3:13:03) to spend 120 a year no I don't how much do you expect him to pay I think he should be investing in himself doing

(3:13:09) what he needs to do to progress in I'm just asking for you for the beneficiary how much do you estimate this man's

(3:13:16) gonna have to spend in order to take care of you yearly to I can't give you that cuz I just roughly I can give you

(3:13:23) what I spent on myself a month when it comes to my nails and my hair and all that um nails

(3:13:30) hair um sometimes flights I'd say it's

(3:13:38) like 1,000 like it's a whole another bill okay so you want him to spend at

(3:13:44) least $11,000 a month on you no it could veryy like it's but like there's no

(3:13:49) number I put on it like that's like that's kind of like the fun part for me and the part that's important is seeing

(3:13:56) what they will do like on their own like it's like I'll tell you but it's like after a while it's like you should know

(3:14:02) this is what I want this is this is how it's going to go okay well maybe I can frame it differently let's say man makes zero money okay okay what ways would he

(3:14:10) invest in you that you would see him as a potential partner even if he's making

(3:14:15) no money like making no money probably like cuz my my promo modeling I'm an independent contractor so um I push

(3:14:23) myself and um do reviews for other businesses so if he was helping push my business I am a brand ambassador for a

(3:14:29) nail girly so if he's giving out cards for me and stuff that's an important one um the the um probably the trips and

(3:14:38) excursions is a big one but it can't take you on trips with no money oh right

(3:14:44) so you're telling saying with no money what can hang on into the mic end the mic yeah you're saying with no money

(3:14:50) moneyone yeah no money um not [ __ ] right support no he could support me do you

(3:14:56) value companionship like just support me in my

(3:15:02) business continue to thrive in whatever he's doing even if he's making zero money if you are still driving for

(3:15:09) something like if you're doing real estate or in school or doing something so he can benefit you by like doing

(3:15:14) business leg work yeah okay and he could also benefit me in like picking like

(3:15:20) cars you could pick me up are you ever going to take this guy out on dates with your own money I feel like I may pitch for

(3:15:28) excursions what does that mean like there's a Bas sum and I pitch in maybe

(3:15:34) like 30% so you're not going to pay for the date no no cuz I I am I'm I'm the

() 

(3:15:41) prize I I'm not I'm not bringing anything to the table because I'm the guest of all so the guy with not a lot

(3:15:46) of resource or almost no resources he can assist your business by doing a bunch of leg work for you but he

(3:15:52) essentially gets zero out of it right he gets to be with me in my pres but is he with you yes he's just in your presence

(3:15:59) I think are you don't get to exp you are you hooking up with that bum are you going to hook up with that

(3:16:05) bum yeah yeah you're going to hook up with them if I'm if I love you and you continuing to support me even in when

(3:16:11) you have zero money cuz when I get with you you going to have some money I'm going tell you that right now you mean when you hook up with them no when when

(3:16:18) they asked me for my information I'm not going to get with a bum period but if they ask me for my information and I got

(3:16:24) them and they're very driven and they got a job at the very least but then they have no job I'm I'mma stick it out

(3:16:30) because I see that they were there when they had okay now I think we've established a floor base so to get with you yes what's the minimum amount for

(3:16:38) that there isn't one you just got to how like I said well there is a minimum

(3:16:44) there has to be a minimum one probably a thousand you have to to a thousand what you said on

(3:16:50) excursions like food nail hairs like I I feel like I said a th

(3:16:58) already like that like you like you asked me like what was everything overall like in a month mhm and I said

(3:17:05) it like $1,000 or a little more um cuz yeah and like fat like I like to I'm On

(3:17:11) My Feet a lot as a model so I like to get foot massages and other things so it's like if I'm going and I already

(3:17:18) scheduled he could just pay for his and he could come with me and I'm not going to expect him to pay for it you know what I'm saying so I feel like it's like

(3:17:25) a it's like a mutual respect but at the end of the day I want you to be a man I want you to have money yeah I want you

(3:17:32) to want good for yourself if I got money you w have money but how much money should he have at least as much money as

(3:17:38) you eventually if you are on a path to have more money than me that's valid cuz

(3:17:44) you don't have less money than you we might have a discussion about so you

(3:17:52) do want your guy to end up have making more money you okay but right now it's not super important still hella young

(3:17:59) you know what I'm saying so we still got time to learn and these men get the luxury of being in your presence and

(3:18:04) helping your business yes and coming to things with me like I've done um like a

(3:18:10) lot of events and they just get come with me you know whoever can I ask you something like let's say that you do you

(3:18:18) do you like uh are your parents both married um no my my well my mother is

(3:18:24) married now but they're divorced do you know your father pretty well he's a kind of kind of yeah I'm his firstborn

(3:18:30) daughter so he kind of kind of a little bit but he's not really around too much okay when did when did that happen um

(3:18:38) young like probably like six basically your mom raised you yeah okay got you military mama okay what what branch uh

(3:18:46) she's in the army Sergeant did she move around a lot yes she did yeah yeah that's how that works

(3:18:51) right different stations milary brat yeah military brat okay uh did you go overseas um not with her no she just did

(3:18:59) okay okay so so but just backing up um does your mom have male friends who've

(3:19:04) been like a part of your life for a long time um yeah they're not hella around

(3:19:10) but uh she has a she has a husband so it's like do you have a good relationship with him yeah okay okay so

(3:19:16) if if he was sitting down right with his son mhm would you advise his son to date

(3:19:24) you I think if you're dating well I mean do you think he should advise his son

(3:19:29) that he should date you if he the son's like Dad I'm looking for the right girl

(3:19:35) I think that's weird sister I'm kind of in I'm kind of in the middle of of different thing let's say you weren't

(3:19:40) related you just know him okay yeah yeah okay so you just know him right but would you if he was telling son right to

(3:19:48) date a woman like you is what I'm asking I think if if you have the means to date

(3:19:54) a woman like you cuz a lot of the time the men who are bums and don't have no money don't have a car they're just

(3:20:00) trying to have sex they're not trying to look for a relationship they're not like that sure yeah so and they're seems but

(3:20:08) doesn't that seem like it's way easier than getting your [ __ ] coffee and promoting your business and as a man

(3:20:14) that could be your opin spending thousands of dollars on you in the hopes that maybe something will happen rather

(3:20:20) than just going ah I would just Smash If I can and then find a woman who's way less work than that I don't think so cuz

(3:20:27) I'm a I'm I have a lot of goals and I'm very driven yeah men don't care about goals They Don't Care About You

(3:20:32) Financial they do they don't care they don't give a [ __ ] see this is what she talked about generalizing care which

(3:20:39) majority of people need uh two incomes to make house a lot of men want to be

(3:20:45) stay-at home dads these days they don't yes they do most people most people marry in the same socioeconomic status

() 

(3:20:51) that they're in that's true because that's what women will marry is at least a man who is within who is within the

(3:20:58) same socials econ or higher they usually marry up actually I'm just talking about

(3:21:03) people in general not women not men but this makes my

(3:21:08) point thises my and nobody's disputing that either both of these make my point

(3:21:14) so they do care if they can care listen man the man themselves don't care that

(3:21:19) much about women's economic goals they don't care about them if they can't afford rent and they want a family then

(3:21:24) yes they do why are they not marrying poor women they do well we just agree that the majority marry the same rich

(3:21:31) men marry poor wom but but you contradict yourself here because you say they marry people based on proximity I

(3:21:37) agree they marry people based on proximity usually the people that you're going to meet are going to be at like

(3:21:42) work sure they're going to be in areas like this so they're probably going to be making around the same amount of money you do but men do marry poor women

(3:21:49) especially rich men marry poor hang on marry poor women all the time women do not marry poor or uh rich women don't

(3:21:56) marry poor men and women of good uh high social economic status they usually

(3:22:02) still marry up not down that is the case and I think that's good I mean I I'm I'm

(3:22:09) just asking if men don't really care why I mean obviously agree because of

(3:22:15) proximity because of proximity that's who they have access to yeah that's who they have access to if they had access to only poor women they would marry them

(3:22:21) okay yeah don't you agree um I mean no I I think uh within today's society that

(3:22:28) uh most people generally want someone who uh at least is able to to take care of themselves yeah but or take care of

(3:22:36) them but I think it's mostly women women seem to want to to uh have men who make

(3:22:41) more than them and Men seem to care less about if women make more than them same as them or less than them they don't

(3:22:48) seem to care as much I I don't know I I think a lot of women really do uh invest in what they perceive as potential um

(3:22:55) you know either he's starting a career he's doing something new he's not making a lot of money um and then they kind of

(3:23:01) grow that together but it depends on the age bracket that you're in yeah sure but I'm just telling you that if most men if

(3:23:08) you had to pick the choice smoking hot 10 uh Starbucks Barista right who treats

(3:23:15) you well you you can marry her right and she makes almost nothing you're going to be taken care of for the rest of your

(3:23:21) life or you can marry kind of like the uh three who makes as much as you right

(3:23:26) or a little bit more than you maybe they'll take the 10 Starbucks Barista if they have money if they do yeah well if

(3:23:32) they if what I'm saying is if they have access to it they will yes if they have that access if they

(3:23:39) don't have the access they won't because they don't have the access and I feel like that ties into what I was saying because this man had

(3:23:46) has access to me when I'm very selective with even who my friends are so it's like it's very yeah but the man who's in

(3:23:54) the situation where he can have access to you based on the huge list and criteria that you have has access to

(3:24:01) other women like you and all they need to do is just be less obnoxious or whatever from their perspective I'm not

(3:24:07) saying you're obnoxious I'm just saying you really don't think I'm obnoxious at all I'm not saying you are I'm just saying from their perspective all that

(3:24:13) they would have to do is say okay this woman over here is has less negative trait than this woman does for the same

(3:24:20) amount of investment they're going to go for that okay then he don't love me for real he's looking for something else so

(3:24:26) uh you said women are the prize yeah and then Andrea you agree with that I think on the previous s you said women are the

(3:24:32) prize yes why is that because so first of all the men

(3:24:38) reach out to us right most of the time so obviously we're the price period that's

(3:24:44) literally the answer yes us it's starting to change and hopefully it'll change more and more and more

(3:24:51) there are women that's actually the best argument I've heard for women being the P it's a it's a good it's a decent

(3:24:56) argument you you ask us to go out to dinner you pick us up if I thought you were the prize I would be doing that for

(3:25:02) you for a guy you know it's like but I'm not doing that for a guy this is this is but it's really funny that you bring

(3:25:08) this up right because I don't think it's a great argument I think that this is rooted in cultural tradition right that

(3:25:15) is based around around an kind of a Remnant idea of not quite chivalry but something close to that uh came from um

(3:25:24) kind of 16 1700 uh you know Europe European Commonwealth Traditions when it came to

(3:25:30) courtship of course men always approached women and they had to go through the father they had to go

(3:25:36) through the family things like this and there's a remnant of that that went over into American dating and European dating

(3:25:42) but that's become eroded eroded more and more and more and more and more and it's funny when women [ __ ] kind of

(3:25:49) about Andrew Tate but Andrew Tate's popularity is because he's like nah you don't have to do that it's not important

(3:25:56) if you work on yourself and you end up with a bunch of cash and you end up um in really good shape and you kind of up

(3:26:01) your level right women will come to you and he's right they will so the and his

(3:26:08) proof for this which is pretty decent proof is that the men who are in a really high socioeconomic status right

(3:26:15) and good fly women out from all over the world whenever they want to and they're contacted by them just based purely

(3:26:22) either on fame or money or things like this so he seems to have a great Point here that women will be the pursuers if

(3:26:29) you are in a higher socioeconomic status that you put yourself in so he's like why waste your time pursuing them when

(3:26:37) you can do a b and c and then the women you actually want pursue you there's a lot of resistance to that

(3:26:44) but he seems to have a very valid point for from my perspective once uh we have her back

(3:26:50) we'll get into some of the rest of the show here um so uh I guess are you

(3:26:56) coming back or okay so uh ask everyone to rate their own looks on a scale of 1

(3:27:02) to 10 you can't pick seven starting with you go ahead six okay a five

() 

(3:27:12) 10 nine The Sisterhood was bet betay I saw

(3:27:17) that I saw that I saw that you betrayed The Sisterhood elbow right there you

(3:27:23) can't hide that [ __ ] from me I see everything what what she was doing like

(3:27:28) this she was doing like well she's like 10 and then she says nine she was like what the [ __ ] she like what the [ __ ]

(3:27:35) before we explore that let's have you answer go ahead eight okay six six

(3:27:41) Andrew what do you give yourself four I give myself a five um damn so I mean you

(3:27:46) wanted evidence of The Sisterhood you like you did girl no I just expected her to say

(3:27:53) 10 because she's a models I mean have you seen it looked like you were disappointed like plus

(3:27:58) siiz models are yeah so it's I I mean this idea that like if you're a model

(3:28:04) air go like you must be a 10 I don't understand that I think so like what if I'm a model am I a 10 I mean you could

(3:28:11) be a model if you want to yeah there is a lot of Instagram models out there I just have to to say it doesn't mean

(3:28:16) you're an actual model and for the for the for the 10 for the 10 and the nine

(3:28:22) it sounded like you almost wanted to say 10 though um there's like a smidge of humility in there came up and she was

(3:28:29) just like cuz I could see it she was like a n like like if Andrew's talking

(3:28:35) you got to Yes um so 10 do you think all women are

(3:28:44) tens do I think all women or tens M or should they view themselves as tens I guess yeah I think they should view

(3:28:50) themselves as tens okay are all men tens are all men tens honestly I I don't

(3:28:57) really like I don't know I don't want to like answer these questions that's kind of the point of

(3:29:03) theast I know well it's just um do I think all men or tens um they could

(3:29:08) think that they can think of themselves as tens I don't know but like I don't like are you saying like if I find them

(3:29:14) attractive like to them T like every guy internal metric is yeah for what a 10 is

(3:29:21) I don't do I think every guy's 10 I I can't say yeah is Brian a 10 no okay

(3:29:27) well then not every guy's a 10 but all women are tens um think you you could be a 10 like

(3:29:34) yeah no but are all women tens like you acknowledge I guess they could rate themselves as 10 but do you think all

(3:29:39) women are tens like if she thought she wasn't a 10 and she still like if people think that she's not a 10 I mean and she

(3:29:45) waits herself a 10 I would be like okay you're a 10 you know you go girl okay and uh and then do you think all women

(3:29:53) are well you said you were nine so I don't know if you're going to say that uh do you think women should like rate themselves higher or I do think women

(3:30:00) should rate themselves higher especially when like the reason I rated myself a nine instead of a 10 is because I'm not

(3:30:06) exactly who I want to be yet and I know I can have there is a better version of myself in the future so that's why I

(3:30:13) didn't rate myself as a 10 and I also have like things I'm working on myself like mentally and physically and stuff

(3:30:20) so okay yeah that's the main reason uh I do have a question on this um can you

(3:30:26) guys tell me for I want to do for the the 10 the nine and the eight can you

(3:30:31) tell me a someone that we could Google like a guy it could be a celebrity could

(3:30:36) be just some dude on Instagram um who you think is your looks equivalent my

(3:30:43) like yeah that you think it' be like okay we're like on the in the same league in terms of looks like a

(3:30:49) celebrity yeah yeah like tell me a guy who you think is a 10 well I'm you no

(3:30:54) Tom Holland I don't know I can't think of one right now I'm like well tell me a guy that you think look is a ten in

(3:31:01) looks but not look like um Henry Cav like you don't need to look like let

(3:31:06) them huh come back to me you are part of it but I'm starting with with okay who's a guy who you think is like uh a nine a

(3:31:15) nine name yeah Trevor Jackson Google that please

(3:31:21) Google Images I don't even know who that is he was um the man on gronish and he

(3:31:26) was also on Austin and Alley which one on gronish he uh he was he that's him oh

(3:31:33) he was Austin he would be a 10 if he cut that thing oh that rat the rat ta yeah brought him down a

(3:31:40) bit scroll down yeah okay he's so fine

(3:31:45) oh but yeah yeah the rap tail it may it I it may go as he grows but if it stays

(3:31:52) that's cool for him you know what I'm saying but that's who I feel like my equivalent is is that chat do you think

(3:31:58) that's a fair assessment like looks equivalent it look I it could be I don't

(3:32:04) know um and then do you have a guy who you think is a 10 yeah there's like an artist like that

(3:32:10) I listen to yeah yeah his name is Chris Palace okay we can pull him up yeah I

(3:32:16) think he's a 10 it's usually bad if they bring up musical artist but we'll see how this

(3:32:23) goes this guy yeah he's that okay yeah that's like his more

(3:32:30) recent look right there with the black hoodie he doesn't have colored hair right

(3:32:36) now uh no very fashionable you know no no

(3:32:41) you know how he was saying Thug you know how he was saying you sitting there like a thug I don't know weird it's pretty like the eyebrow thing

(3:32:49) I don't know it makes it difficult because he's got like a kind of um like atypical sort of style to him that makes

(3:32:56) it difficult to do an assessment here um also is there a component here where you're like you really like his music so

(3:33:02) that's going to like amplify your attraction for him yeah he has good music yeah is this scale just based on

(3:33:08) appearance yeah mhm just looks yeah that's it oh I was doing other stuff okay okay um and then going around the

(3:33:15) table and oh I forgot how to show you I I'll come back to this to the back there to figure out how to pull up all the

(3:33:22) stuff from Discord but uh do you think you'll be better looking in 10 years

(3:33:28) time so going around the table you're 37 do you think you'll be better looking in 10 years at 47 no okay and you're 37 do

(3:33:36) you think you were better looking 10 years ago at 27 no uh and so better

() 

(3:33:41) looking now at 37 um I'm on the decline I'd say 33 34 was the peak okay so uh

(3:33:51) let's say 33 your Peak going back to uh 23 better looking at 23 or

(3:33:57) 33 I don't know if you remember like the '90s and 2000s it was very bad stylish

(3:34:03) and makeup wise so I would say 37 you I was born in the ' 80s um I grew up in

(3:34:10) the '90s late when I'm saying she was

(3:34:15) no I'm saying in my early I'm saying the 20 early 2000s the you would have been

(3:34:21) 23 in like 2010

(3:34:26) 2010 yeah it's 2025 right okay what was the question again uh what age sorry

(3:34:32) okay so comparing your Peak at 33 yeah going back 10 years better looking at 23

(3:34:37) or Peak 33 Peak 33 I had horrible style and the emo haircut and all that all

(3:34:44) right uh Kenzie you're 30 better looking do you think you'll be better looking in 10 years time at 48 okay uh 20 years

(3:34:50) time 58 no okay and then going backwards you're uh 38 better looking 10 years ago

(3:34:55) at 28 or better looking now I I think it would be a VAR of metrics but

(3:35:01) yeah uh yes better looking okay uh but better looking at 48 okay you're 23 uh

(3:35:07) Andrea better looking in 10 years time at 33 um I think so okay 20 years time

(3:35:14) 43 um I think I still look good honestly at 43 but better looking oh no I don't

(3:35:20) think better looking than 33 oh not better looking at 33 no no she means 43

(3:35:25) won't be better looking yeah 43 won't be better looking yeah I won't look I will look better at 33 than 43 but 33 better

(3:35:32) looking than now uh you're oh wait she's gone okay uh you're 21 better looking in

(3:35:38) 10 years time at 31 yeah better looking in 20 years time at

(3:35:43) 41 yeah 30 years time 51 M uh 40 years time

(3:35:49) 61 into into the mic please 40 years time 61 what did you say no in 40 years

(3:35:56) at I ain't doing like [ __ ] math equations here sorry what did you say 40 years at 61 oh

(3:36:04) no okay yeah no all right uh you are 33 better looking in 10 years time at

(3:36:11) 43 I think I think so okay uh 20 year time 53 no okay and then you're 33 were

(3:36:19) you better looking at 23 10 years ago my body was better but I think I've grown into my facial face face better okay um

(3:36:26) so in totality better at 33 or 23 better at 33 by the way uh just I

(3:36:33) know the lean for the mic is a bit awkward there you want to scoot your mic back this way just so you're not like awkwardly yeah uh and then you're 21

(3:36:40) better looking in 10 years time at 31 no I think so um all right so I need to

(3:36:47) get up so I can pull up some things we need to react to um Andrew do you want

(3:36:53) to ask the panel question for a little bit while I do that sure sure so when when we ask about the rating 1

(3:37:01) through 10 what do you guys think we asking uh I thought it was more of an assessment in terms of uh your like how

() 

(3:37:10) you would be as a partner oh okay well that I mean that makes sense like you're emotional mhm uh

(3:37:16) capacity you know yeah what do you think we're asking like about reading ourselves 1 through 10 yeah I thought

(3:37:21) literally just physical features I didn't think anything like same mentally or anything no I definitely thought like

(3:37:28) sorry I definitely thought like as a whole person like who you are so I

(3:37:34) yeah well it says looks and caps so I think you were talking about just the

(3:37:40) Aesthetics yeah yeah okay got it why do you think it is that so many women even

(3:37:46) though the question is asked based on looks how would you rate yourself they

(3:37:52) rate themselves on a metric other than looks why do you think that is um I I think as a woman um we are

(3:38:02) attracted to different aspects than just looks and so that's kind of like an

(3:38:08) internal um you know if if someone in looks is an eight

(3:38:14) or a nine but has a [ __ ] personality then I would reduce them down to a five but if someone maybe in looks is a five

(3:38:20) or a six but we're just so compatible meets all checks all the boxes then I would definitely increase it to an eight

(3:38:26) or a n you agree with that um I mean like for datability yeah

(3:38:33) on that scale of datability but looks is a different scale than than that okay uh

(3:38:40) so here's my follow-up question just uh just real quick going around the table more good looking women or good-looking

(3:38:46) men there's more good-looking women women women women women women got it

(3:38:54) okay so then the question is out of that percentage pool of good-look men that

(3:39:00) there are what do you think the percentage pool is like if you had to give the percentage goodlooking men of

(3:39:06) good-looking men out of the whole pool available to your demographic for dating what would you put the percentage at

(3:39:13) just looks wise or just just looks wise just looks like 30

(3:39:20) 30% um yeah I'd say 20

(3:39:26) 20 I don't know maybe like 40 you find 40% of men attractive no

(3:39:32) way um so like I mean four four out of 10 men you see she did show us that one

(3:39:38) guy yeah yeah into the mic it could be valid got to go into that [ __ ] could be valid four four out of 10

(3:39:45) um maybe 30 then 30 so three out of 10 men that you see you're attracted to

(3:39:51) yeah like so if I go out I L like literally will see like five or less

(3:39:56) this is all ages of men um yeah even like cuz I do go out and it's literally like so three out of 10 men find TR that

(3:40:03) changes are we bringing up 8year olds in our ratings cuz I don't think are 8y old

(3:40:08) oh 80-year-old I'm sorry no I don't think the majority of the population are bringing up all ages okay so let's try

(3:40:14) it this way we'll frame it an easier way right so between the ages of 20 and let's say 50 how's that how many does

(3:40:23) your answer change 2250 no um no I think it's 30% 30% you find

(3:40:31) three out of 10 hang on I just want to make sure at 50y olds me do you find three out of 10 50y olds attractive

(3:40:38) there are some good-looking 50y olds but like right three out of 10 I me I'm two out of 10 what's that I was two out of

(3:40:45) 10 that makes sense to me but three out of 10 50y old so the one difference is I mean but it's from 20 year 20-y old to

(3:40:51) 50y old yeah yeah yeah and there's lots of silver foxes you know yeah only 50 only 50 year olds I would

(3:40:59) say like not many yeah prob 20 20 and not many 40 year olds right um 40 year

(3:41:05) olds um probably not probably still like 20% so maybe like 30 to 20 something in

(3:41:11) there you find most most of the guys in that age bracket what would be the percentage around that age bracket like 40 to 50 10

(3:41:17) to 20 okay go over here um I feel like cuz of my my job and like where I

(3:41:25) go I feel like it's higher so I feel like it's like 50 for me yeah yeah just

(3:41:31) men that you literally see everywhere CU you see men everywhere I feel like I'm around men who take care of themselves

(3:41:39) you walk on the street don't you yeah but not very often yeah when you look around and you see men do you find five

(3:41:46) do you find half of them attractive they have to be like atrociously ugly and out

(3:41:52) of shape for me to find find not find them attractive really if I'm being honest like they you they're like like

(3:41:59) in my opinion coming from a like a beauty industry so you think 50% yeah okay and then you did say that you think

(3:42:06) there's way more attractive women than men right yeah okay so then what's the percentage of attractive women then I

(3:42:13) don't know 60% 70 no I feel like because women are more likely to take care of

(3:42:18) themselves in the long run there's more attractive women so what's the percentage from from the 20 to 50 you

(3:42:27) said okay I'll do 6040 6040 okay so 60 women 40 men M

(3:42:38) yeah so 60% of women in that age bracket are uh good they're attractive and 40%

(3:42:44) of men are are okay so how many men do you find attractive within the age bracket of like 20 to 50 I would say

(3:42:52) there's a little bit more in LA because of I guess the culture and what La attracts but I would probably say 20%

(3:43:00) 20% okay I would say appearance wise 10%

(3:43:05) 10% yeah so 10 to 20% that's a pretty common answer right for what women find

(3:43:10) attractive so this doesn't surprise me at all so so here's here's what we found

(3:43:17) and at least the the studies that we've we've looked at I think Brian can actually pull them up on what women find

(3:43:23) attractive or don't find attractive but you can see for mate selection that if women only find 10 or 20% of the entire

(3:43:31) dating pool that's available to them attractive most men are they're not going to find most men attractive right

(3:43:38) yeah they're just not going to and if you think that there's way more women who are attractive than there are men

(3:43:43) then that lower lessens the amount that are available to him even more right mhm

(3:43:50) yeah mhm okay so if this the case right then this percentage of men the

(3:43:58) small percentage of men who women do find attractive more women are going to want to get with those men right so

(3:44:04) those men have options that other men don't have yeah sure yeah so then the

(3:44:10) this is called hypergamy the idea of hypergamy which is that uh women generally will go to this top percentile

(3:44:17) of men not because they're rich and this and that but just because that's the only percentage of pool they generally

(3:44:23) find to be attractive that's it right for me I mean I definitely give

(3:44:30) people chances even if I don't find them attractive just because people could be very attractive I personally I just

(3:44:36) don't find them attractive I wouldn't even dispute that but if a man was available who you did find attractive versus a man who wasn't you would s for

(3:44:42) the man who you found attractive right I think for me it would depend on different

(3:44:47) criteria but if a man had the criteria that he wanted and was attractive and another man had the criteria you wanted

(3:44:54) and was not attractive wouldn't you still select for the one you had attraction for I would say most likely but I think it would also depend on um

(3:45:00) like the uniqueness of the relationship yeah sure sure but you're not going to you want to have physical relationships

(3:45:06) with men you don't find attractive generally people don't want to have physical relationships with people they

(3:45:12) don't I'm not disagreeing with you I'm just saying that I think people can become more attractive depending on certain criteria of their personality

(3:45:18) and people can become less don't disagree but you have to have a shot right and the best way to get a shots to

(3:45:23) be attractive to the other sex yeah I think for women like personality I've

(3:45:30) dated more people you could consider like less than average and attractiveness because of personality I

(3:45:38) was just bro how you got back here go ahead pull it pull it up

(3:50:36) and it stemmed from you saying that either I or Andrew or both of us have low IQ and we're stupid and making jokes

(3:50:43) about like other stuff um and then Andrew made a joke about deportation

(3:50:48) which you were like deeply offended by that was you yeah that was her that was really funny she didn't think so I

(3:50:54) thought so though yeah um so do you guys want to have like a quick like you know just political debate on like

() 

(3:51:00) legal illegal immigration I feel like this is a good it's just I just find it kind of weird how like oh my God people

(3:51:06) shouldn't be here illegally like it's so wrong that they're criminals like what coming over here is literally a that's

(3:51:12) literally crazy like it's a it's a but it's like this is stolen land and it's like known to stolen Mexico stolen

(3:51:20) land yeah do you know the history of like Mexico City Mexico stolen so Mexico stolen land I can't immigrate

(3:51:27) there that's kind of [ __ ] up huh I can't believe that they do that I can't believe that they went and butchered all

(3:51:34) of the indigenous people in Mexico Mexicans did right this would uh be

(3:51:39) mysos went through and butchered all the indigenous people and stole that land I thought mysos

(3:51:46) the like the colonized no so what happened is Spaniards came over and then

(3:51:52) they mixed with the indigenous people created mosos mosos took over most of what is now Mexico they took over

(3:51:59) California they had Texas they had all of that the indigenous people were not mosos they butchered them so they stole

(3:52:05) their land I will look into that look into it

(3:52:12) mhm all land all modern land is is stolen from some group or another group

(3:52:17) so yeah that is the history there right that is the history of South America is it changed hands multiple times between

(3:52:23) many many groups there are white South American nations do you know about the Spanish conquistadors yeah yeah they but

(3:52:31) they were mostly so that was like a a a mixture of uh geographical locations

(3:52:38) that they came into like Cortez went through Aztec lands in South America I don't remember the exact geographical

(3:52:44) location me either but but but yeah they did yes this was mostly Spaniards then Spaniards

(3:52:50) made misos misos butchered the indigenous population for sure so it's all stolen land I don't know why it is

(3:52:57) that I can't immigrate there I can't just walk across the border there because well they arrest you and throw

(3:53:02) your ass back to your own country it's pretty easy to walk across the border to Mexico and then if they if

(3:53:09) you're there illegally they ship you back here because you're not supposed to be in their country cuz they have a

(3:53:15) constitutionally elected government and um yeah but they're not border laws

(3:53:20) deporting that's cuz nobody wants to go there if people if people did and by the way they do when people come from south

(3:53:27) of Mexico into Mexico they will keep them out and they have the Mexican military on their southern borders

(3:53:34) keeping out people who try to migrate through Mexico that's what happened with the whole Caravan thing they were

(3:53:40) literally trying to keep them out of their Nation so I don't know why it is that Mexico can have a border policy but

(3:53:45) we can't that's really strange I mean I think we should I I have one argument for that if we have a declining

(3:53:52) population and with births why should we get rid of the act

(3:53:58) like the um illegals when we need them for our

(3:54:03) economy well okay so first of all I don't think that you need to have a

(3:54:08) continuously growing GDP it's not necessary for the Health and Welfare of the nation that's one and then the

(3:54:15) second thing is is that I think if you're going to spend your resources on

(3:54:20) uh basically legals who come in on healthc care things like this rather than supplementing your indigenous

(3:54:27) population so that they can have more live bursts that seems really stupid to me why wouldn't you allocate your

(3:54:33) resources to your domestic population it just seems like you want to kind of

(3:54:38) force women into having babies instead of bringing inever advoc women should be

(3:54:44) forced to do anything oh the abortion laws and all that that's not force that's that's saying you can't do a

(3:54:50) thing it's not forcing you to do a thing do you want to actually contend with the actual topic at end though no yeah

(3:54:57) continue on I just I just have that one I mean abortion is a separate topic oh no no I that it started because when you

(3:55:03) were gone I was talking about since besides that you said you're against most abortions no no I am so then you

(3:55:09) would use Force because no no no listen it's because the birth rates go down and that's on the show a lot of times that's

(3:55:16) a topic on anti-abortion and um I'm just like if why kick them out if we need

(3:55:23) their population for to keep birth yeah but this is a really strange argument

(3:55:28) because if we didn't have a reproduction crisis we wouldn't need to be importing

(3:55:34) anybody from anywhere we can focus on our domestic population they're already here which is a domestic population and

(3:55:40) we're kicking them out when we need them so no we don't need them we don't need illegal here most of so for one thing

(3:55:46) you're talking about a million people a year who immigrate legally yeah our population boomed from 150 million to

(3:55:52) 330 million right on par with the immigration policy of a million people coming in per year so thing is is

(3:56:00) like how much more do we need to import what happens by the way is that when the

(3:56:06) these people come in when they come in within a generation they're right down to the low reproduction rates just like

(3:56:12) everybody else is I thought yeah I don't I don't I'd have to look up that up but I think it's kind of the opposite it's

(3:56:19) kind of not so um we're going to do the gender swap portion here uh but I mean

(3:56:24) just to your point it is a crime it's uh I I looked it up it's 8 USC subsection 1325 it's a crime tenter unlawful

(3:56:33) entry yeah but I don't know just like Maring them as like oh you're a criminal

(3:56:39) it's just like I don't know people look at criminals as like really bad people like the thiefs and like

(3:56:47) murders and you know just like abuser like I mean want a napkin and like the

(3:56:52) people who come into this country I making a mess but you want a napkin did I make a mess is it on me no just he ask

(3:57:00) if you wanted napkin and the people come here to live a better life to work hard provide for

(3:57:06) their family because um you know they just want to do better for nobody's

(3:57:12) disputing the motivation of wanting to go to a country that isn't yours for a better life the question becomes does

(3:57:18) the indigenous population of that country the people who are in that country who are citizens of that country have a say and who gets to come in and

(3:57:25) who doesn't I think they do just like you have a say as to who comes into your house and doesn't come in your house so

(3:57:32) the Japanese for instance they don't allow they don't allow Mass migration of any kind it's it I don't know it's also

(3:57:38) kind of weird it's like oh you can't come into our country but we we'll go into yours and vacation there and like

(3:57:43) we'll you can come here on vacation it's you can so here's what you do you go get a passport and you can come here and have

(3:57:50) a vacation then go back home and we can go to your country with a passport and go on vacation and then come back home

(3:57:57) that's how that works that doesn't mean that you have citizenship and that you can then drain the coffers for social

(3:58:03) welfare and drain the coffers for medical care like that's that's a nogo like why why is why do you think

(3:58:11) that the citizenry of the United States is going to want to supplement people who aren't from their people group they

(3:58:18) don't want to like um like white white Americans like they go live in Mexico because it's cheaper and stuff and yeah

(3:58:25) they have to go through the same process though they have to apply for limited citizenship and then they have to apply

(3:58:31) for uh Mexican citizens citizenship they want to stay there longterm but like a lot of them don't yeah they go there on

(3:58:38) vacation true they just have to come back every certain amount of time and they abide by that instead of actually

(3:58:43) getting by the way for the Mexican Government this is a good thing right because they get all sorts of money from

(3:58:49) the Greeno who brings in that Greeno Greenback and that's worth a lot more

(3:58:54) than the Mexican peso is so they love having tourists come in and things like that it's not the same fiscal drain on

(3:59:00) them as it is on us it's a literal fiscal drain on this country not to have

(3:59:06) vacationers come in but to have people come in who are at the like lowest economic or economic status you could

(3:59:14) possibly be at and then immediately they come in and get welfare they get uh

(3:59:19) Medical Care they get all of this literally on our tax dollar now it's really easy for you to say well we

(3:59:24) should do that I just think it's but you don't pay for that it's wrong like the like the immigrants here like we work

(3:59:31) hard and everything we contribute to this country too it's not like we're here and just living life no they work

(3:59:38) hard 24/7 there's no dispute I've I've literally I lived in California I grew

(3:59:43) up in California I saw what immigrant labor did in the lettuce fields and when they were uh

(3:59:49) working in The Vineyards especially I see it in Michigan when they're picking fruit yeah that's hard ass work nobody's

(3:59:55) disputing that we have migrant work programs so that migrants can come in and work and then go back to their home

(4:00:01) country a majority of immigrants are those people too and it's just like oh Deport them Deport them it's just

(4:00:08) like you're deporting hardworking immigrants that is contributing to your country like the food you have is

(4:00:15) here's the it's easily accessible they also come in and do remittances so they what they do is they come in and they

(4:00:20) get American dollars here and then they send it back to their origin Nation untaxed it doesn't help us at all so

(4:00:26) okay but you it literally like you guys go into our country whatever just well

(4:00:33) which is your country is the United States your country or is Mexico your country here but yeah I can still say like Mexico it's like you know my is

(4:00:39) that your country or isn't it no it's not it's not like my actual country so your country from while I was born here in the United

(4:00:46) States so who are your countrymen well I'm Mexican Aman but I do have family in Mexico sure you have family there but

(4:00:52) who are your countrymen I think she's highlighting her ethnic background is

(4:00:57) that what you think I didn't know that she was doing that but I'm really glad you clarify it's super nice of you so

(4:01:03) anyway I was just curious though if we get back to this I can't say I can't say I can't say like oh that's my country I

(4:01:09) wasn't born there but um yeah I was just curious who yeah so like if Mexico and

() 

(4:01:14) America went to war who do you have your loyalty

(4:01:22) to don't know do you think that might maybe that's a problem with having immigrants in wait let's get an answer

(4:01:28) go ahead that is who's your loyalty question um I would do a lot to protect

(4:01:34) like Mexicans and everything honestly so maybe for the people who are here right

(4:01:40) who when we hear this from uh even people who are born here with American citizenship if my country goes to war

(4:01:47) with your country I'm going to side with that other country and not my own country I'm born here like I can't

(4:01:52) really do anything about that's true except Advocate on behalf of the enemy who we could be at war with since I live

(4:01:58) here I can't really do anything like about it well you can you can vote and you can Advocate on behalf of potential

(4:02:04) enemies of the United States so if we go to war with Mexico now you have loyalties to Mexico and not to the

(4:02:10) United States that's a massive problem with immigrants coming in especially in Mass from a single country

(4:02:16) is now we have dual loyalties we have to deal with that's not a good idea no Nation would put up with

(4:02:22) that like what nation would ever put up with that like imagine this let me give you

(4:02:28) this scenario so let's say that there's millions of people who are like-minded like you who said well I would prefer

(4:02:34) actually to advocate for Mexico if there was a war between Mexico and America right and then we had a draft and we

(4:02:41) drafted tens of thousands of people who who thought like that now you have soldiers in the field who are willing to

(4:02:47) shoot other soldiers in the back right I I honestly respect both I

(4:02:52) just I can't I don't know I wouldn't like what was your original question where does her loyalties lie to the

(4:02:57) United States or Mexico in the event of a war yeah and she said she do I don't know I I respect if you had to pick

(4:03:04) one well since I live here I don't know I would have to pick

(4:03:09) the us but like you know but you have a lot of loyal there right I would still

(4:03:15) feel for Mexico you know this came up this this problem historically has come up in World War II we intered to the

(4:03:21) Japanese the Japanese who lived here in America we intered them in internment camps under lock and key and armed

(4:03:28) guards because we're at war with their origination and we couldn't take the risk that they were going to sabotage or

(4:03:34) kill our soldiers on behalf of our enemies like this has historically happened that we've had to do that

(4:03:42) someone someone said like um myow the threshold Mexico what about it I don't

(4:03:49) know um but I don't know I I wouldn't like live there because I was born and raised here so I'm very Americanized so

(4:03:57) I I wouldn't like fit in all completely with Mexico

(4:04:03) yeah uh okay here let's do the gender oh wait but she's G damn bro okay um we'll do the gender swaps

(4:04:10) here we'll Skip and then when she comes back we'll we'll do it so let's do the gender swap move but skip one

(4:04:17) person all right so the question here is um can you hide the thing in the the streamyard thing the black

() 

(4:04:24) bar all right can you zoom it out make it a little smaller uh that's sufficient okay so the

(4:04:32) question here is would you date your S I guess but as a male um no how no

(4:07:58) arrived into Mexico and began to drain public services or make political

(4:08:08) demands you want to answer that or can keep wondering I guess yeah one

(4:08:15) sec keep wondering but like let's say I wanted to and like let's say just a bunch of Americans around us whatever

(4:08:21) country it is wanted to move to uh Japan for example uh and they just they went

(4:08:27) there legally and they were like okay I would the Japanese not have a right to

(4:08:33) remove them from the

(4:08:40) country I mean I would would say like I don't

(4:08:47) know I wouldn't I'm not going to be the person to be like yes like take them out Japan like you know what you're there

(4:08:59) know do better better for yourself and stuff and I mean but you're there illegally and hiding and stuff and and

(4:09:07) all that um okay I don't know like all right um I don't know I'm not the type

(4:09:12) of person get out like unless unless you are like a murderer you want to just you take those off the table the you can

(4:09:17) just throw them on the ground it's fun um okay uh go I guess going back to Jen

(4:09:23) then some of your or you had something you wanted to weigh in on this topic or I don't remember don't remember okay uh

(4:09:30) so Jen you had said hold on I'm getting back to your notes here because we kind of cut off where we were at

(4:09:37) uh W there's a lot here I'm not going to get to you sent a lot

(4:09:44) the night before so I was like okay so your POS yeah so we were we were kind of talking about how the show

(4:09:50) is just as harmful as only fans we talked about that uh and this was this is where we kind of stopped so you said

(4:09:57) considering how much domestic violence there is in the world yeah you don't think it is very healthy to spread

(4:10:04) rhetoric about women to mentally damaged men and we were exploring that a little bit so first I'm just when it comes to

(4:10:11) the mentally damaged man hold on sir sorry sorry um when it comes to

(4:10:19) mentally damaged men I I'll just defer to Hitchens razor that which is asserted without evidence can be dismissed

(4:10:25) without evidence you have no evidence that my viewership is mentally damaged I me I reject it completely I mean that's

(4:10:31) fine I'd say like the comments where it's really hateful I'd say those people are pretty mentally damaged so same with

(4:10:38) some of the people on the show is this just you and her just uh what rhetoric am I spreading

() 

(4:10:44) it's not really you it's some of the guests you have which means it is kind of sort of related to you and it's just

(4:10:51) like a generalized term I'm a I'm uh responsible for what my guests say I'm

(4:10:57) not saying you I don't have a problem with you Brian I think you you problem hold on your claim is uh I sole

(4:11:05) proprietor whatever podcast my business my show uh you said that uh that the

(4:11:13) show is just as harmful as only fans in society okay so you might not have like

(4:11:20) maybe you find me more agreeable but what rhetoric is being

(4:11:27) spread just generalizing people and I don't I don't freaking know

(4:11:33) Artic articulate something bring up past episodes to remember all of us you have a lot of episodes and I have a

(4:11:39) short-term you know memory what generalizations just about what women

(4:11:45) want and that we use people for money like never said that but okay I didn't say you said that who said that then I

(4:11:52) don't Andrew doesn't say that either when you say into the mic please people you've had on the show who

(4:11:59) which ones I don't know most of the people you've had on the show's names other than

(4:12:06) him okay what the people in the comments when you say that women want status and

(4:12:12) money it is that wrong no it I mean yeah I I don't believe that and certain

(4:12:19) transactional people want that but not the average woman doesn't want a

(4:12:25) transactional um situation we we want love and like a partnership not status

(4:12:31) I'd rather not date somebody with status I think that they're more likely to be like abusive or more likely to not who

(4:12:39) wait who's more likely to be abusive oh statistically it's you're more likely and if have a a position of uh Power to

(4:12:46) be like narcissistic or uh sociopathic Psychopathic because you have the Charisma and the the um look it up it's

(4:12:54) actually true I would prefer somebody to be normal and I'm normal and I just

(4:13:00) don't think that's represented a lot on the show is just normal people dating okay so you think it's going to

(4:13:08) lead to domestic violence if it can't when when you like you got let me finish like s can you just let me finish a

(4:13:15) sentence without interrupting I'm sorry I don't mean to I'm so sorry I get you don't mean to how about you just make the correction so you're saying that the

(4:13:25) rhetoric on the show is going to lead to domestic violence against women how like

(4:13:32) saying that women should submit and how would that be how would that lead to domestic violence he's saying that there's I I say women should be

(4:13:38) submissive so I'll have submissive is fine I'm fine with submissive but Andrew you just said women should submit that

(4:13:43) will lead to domestic violence no I'm I'm trying to explain my answer when Andrew goes to the extremes

(4:13:50) of saying oh is it really submitting if you have limits to that which are like boundaries like you have boundaries that

(4:13:57) is when it becomes dangerous nobody advocates for no boundaries well it kind of sounds like

(4:14:03) that when you say it sounds to me like you just always hear what you want to hear regardless of what's said you just

(4:14:08) hear what you want to hear no you say well if there's you say like multiple times you say well if there's there's a

(4:14:15) limit to it then you're not actually submitting that's incorrect so here's what I'll here's what I'll do here's what I'll do instead I'll let you steal

(4:14:22) man the position that you think I have and then I'll tell you if it's correct or not you've said it multiple times

(4:14:27) said what that if you're like oh if women uh have limits to their submission

(4:14:33) are they really submitting oh yeah really never heard them say that I'm going to send you the clips send it I'll

(4:14:38) have to send it you won't because it's not there episodes I've watched it position at all my position is not so

(4:14:46) I've watched it okay do I give prescriptions for when women should get divorced in a Christian marriage do I

(4:14:51) tell you what the prescriptions are I don't I don't remember you don't know suddenly you don't know what my

(4:14:57) positions are you know all of them except the the ones that I I'm assuming it's Christian beliefs no like if

(4:15:04) there's abuse there's abuse right physical abuse

(4:15:10) if there's abandonment right if there's if there's addiction these are all grounds well

(4:15:16) that's good aren't those all limits what about like hang on aren't those all limits yeah well I thought you just said

(4:15:21) a second ago that I said there's no limit I'm just responding to what you say on the show you've are that was part of your argument you're not really

(4:15:28) submissive if if you have boundaries wait wait wait wait wait wait hold on hold on hold on hold on hold on I do

(4:15:33) need to have this exchange so

(4:15:39) what the suggestion here is based on the rhetoric that is espoused on the podcast domestic

() 

(4:15:46) violence is being increased I'm not saying it is I'm saying it like when when I hear stuff about a woman should

(4:15:54) submit and there's um why would that increase domestic violence if there's no boundaries to that um I think No

(4:16:01) Boundaries what well actually wouldn't that actually lead to a decrease if there was no boundaries to the

(4:16:06) submission would that lead to a decrease because some things that men could ask women to do can be abusive like

(4:16:15) like what what do you mean give me an example of what you're talking about like making someone

(4:16:24) basically yeah they have no Financial say in anything they have no say on their body they have no say on any part

(4:16:30) of their life and they're used as labor or sex or whatever and they can't say no to things I don't know it just sounds

(4:16:36) like a personal preference to me did you take all the pineapple off your pizza Andrew that's

(4:16:43) that that just sounds like do you think that there's women who have a preference where they don't want to make any

(4:16:48) financial decisions and they just want to do what their husband says yeah but it's not abuse no there should be limits

(4:16:55) everything if if uh women's working at home and they don't have money for their own shoes but they that's not your

(4:17:00) [ __ ] business that like that is not your [ __ ] bussiness there's something called Financial there's something called mind your own [ __ ] business

(4:17:08) there's a lot of things that you talk on that's not your business you still do it business is and how you should mind it

(4:17:14) like it's not for you it's not for you to make a determination that a woman needs to have her own money for X how do

(4:17:22) you determine that you just make it up because I was in Annie for 10 plus years I made way above the national average

(4:17:28) and be like like I it was a hard job why would we get married to you and then I

(4:17:34) wouldn't want you to get married to me you I mean men in general I wouldn't want I wouldn't want men in general to

(4:17:39) marry you when we have jobs why would we get rid of job why you're right I agree

(4:17:45) so I don't even understand what the argument is I completely agree with you if you are advocating that a woman needs

(4:17:52) to be able to be a sassy pants I have my own money I'm a girl boss should you marry that I'm dis I don't have you

(4:17:59) marry should you marry her if she's not in alignment with your goals the answer is [ __ ] no you shouldn't it's very

(4:18:04) simple yeah alignment with goals is different than getting married and my goal is to have a woman let's say who

(4:18:10) submits to me yeah submission is fine when it's not abusive what well abusive is perspective what is abusive is me is

(4:18:18) me making the financial decision that you can't go spend money is that abusive it can be possible can be

(4:18:27) abusive if it's to an extrem perspective right that's perspective anything can be

(4:18:32) abusive to an ex so let's say you go out you spend $4,000 you really shouldn't have spent that's an ex stop let's say

(4:18:39) you go spend $4,000 you shouldn't have spent so I cut off your credit cards and you can't spend anything is that

(4:18:45) abusive no if you we can't afford it no it's not abusive right so I guess cutting women off from money isn't

(4:18:52) always abusive is it I didn't say it was did I so so the thing is is like having alignment and perspective of if a man

(4:18:59) wants to make the financial decisions that's kind that's not only not abusive but you what you do is you give this

(4:19:05) like nebulous idea if the man so it's baked into the hypothetical the man

(4:19:10) shouldn't be abusive if he's abusive it's like like yeah sure but give me examples of what you're talking about well if if a woman's being abused and

(4:19:17) she has see what I mean if a woman's being abused what is that though let's say being hit or yeah I

(4:19:25) don't Advocate women get hit I'm saying if they're put in a financial situation where they cannot

(4:19:32) leave and they are not getting their fundamental basic things Tak care of

(4:19:37) like what they're not they can't have food clothes so you so you think I you

(4:19:43) think that I advocate that women who are dependent on men say did that the men don't feed them or get them clothes

(4:19:50) there are abuses there are not no nobody's ever advocated for that that's just [ __ ] ridicul then what what is

(4:19:57) the abuse you're talking about then so you your statement uhhuh about

(4:20:04) submission you're not really submitting yeah if if you have objections at all um

(4:20:11) then you're not really submitting I heard you say that like multiple shows that's what I'm have a problem with yeah

(4:20:17) even though that's never been said I'll send it to you after the show there was recent

(4:20:22) episodes yeah the idea here is things like this you can't decide what School

(4:20:27) Junior goes to you should defer to the man if you don't defer to the man you're

(4:20:33) not actually submitting to him that is true yes I I agree that's true but in

(4:20:39) argument you said you're not really submitting if you have OB at all no that's never happened I'm going to in

(4:20:46) fact I've said multiple times that the proportion of submission has to comport with reason so a man can't ask you to do

(4:20:52) things like jump off a building and you go no and you you're not really [ __ ] submitting then I'll send you the clips

(4:21:00) but it sounded pretty bad when I heard it that's because you hear what you want to hear you legit said that though no I

(4:21:06) doubt it since we don't have the clip then I don't I'll s to you afterwards but I promise that's fine so I need to

(4:21:12) have a some back and forth here so uh you again the harmful rhetoric from the

(4:21:18) show is leading to increases in domestic violence against women I didn't say it was I said it

(4:21:23) could okay you being on the show could lead to an increase in like male murders I don't I don't know how to contend with

(4:21:30) like it could something I think if someone doesn't have good morals then they shouldn't be

(4:21:37) thinking that women should submit to them and the majority of these men it's just incoherent okay how is it

(4:21:43) incoherent it's just all over if you don't have morals you shouldn't no if you don't have morals you shouldn't be

(4:21:49) thinking that a women should commit moral whose morals yours just normal morals in society based on who like

(4:21:56) don't don't scream and cuss out a woman don't isolate them don't isolate them

(4:22:02) from why not what if she cusses and yells at you then you shouldn't do that then y'all should both leave cuz it's

(4:22:08) toxic what if you tell a woman to shut up the [ __ ] can you tell can you tell your wife to shut up yeah oh okay well

(4:22:15) then seems fine to me um you said men with no virtue are getting

(4:22:21) unhealthy dude I'm sorry men with no virtue are getting

(4:22:27) unhealthy ideas about relationships and putting women in danger yes that's the

() 

(4:22:32) same thing we were talking about before you're talking about my audience yeah a lot of them don't have virt if you're going around what do you

(4:22:39) have that my audience doesn't have virtue I'm prepared to take the position my audience has greater virtue than the

(4:22:44) general average population even more who's right um so

(4:22:51) okay what evidence do you have for that sorry go

(4:22:58) ahead because first of all the things they're saying but um because the things

(4:23:03) are said ER go audience has no virtue I say bad thing audience has no virtue

(4:23:09) does follow because if when y'all say stuff like women don't care about body count and um I'm the majority of women

(4:23:17) don't but okay we do and the way that men are

(4:23:22) going around lying to women to get them to sleep with them like let's say her case where she was a safety in her case

(4:23:30) it's very toxic when um you're comparing

(4:23:35) women's body count when like a large portion of the time we're not going around being horny we actually want

(4:23:42) relationships with these people and men think it's okay to lie to get do you

(4:23:49) wear makeup yeah that it's a lie I'm covering a rash right now you're lying yeah but my body is different than my

(4:23:55) face hello can you stop interrupting um yeah women lie through wearing makeup

(4:24:02) and that's inducing men who wouldn't otherwise be attracted to these women to have sex with them you lie about all manner of your appearance there's

(4:24:08) plastic surgery there's like uh the what the [ __ ] wearing certain like the the padded bras and [ __ ] women lie about

(4:24:14) their physical appearance men care a whole lot about how you look women lie about it you induce men to have sex with you that otherwise wouldn't true so um

(4:24:22) the transgender topic when you say it's no this this correlates and let me finish when you say that you would um

(4:24:30) argue that it's sa if a transgender person doesn't um say disclose disclose

(4:24:37) um did you know that it's actually consed coercion which is illegal if they

(4:24:42) if if you want to have sex with someone based on the knowledge that you have of them um and you have sex with them um

(4:24:51) based on a lie that's actually if you look it up it's actually called Co coercion so I would uh argue that it's

(4:24:58) coercion if like a married man um lies to have sex with someone or um someone

(4:25:04) lies about their entire hon then every single human being who's ever lived is a

(4:25:11) Grapist people lie all the time I'll stay with you forever this is and and

(4:25:16) this will be an inducement for this person to have a sexual relationship with them I'll never leave you these are things that people say to each other in

(4:25:22) a relationship I'll love you forever um I'll never leave you invariably they

(4:25:28) don't love that person anymore I don't think somebody because they've now they've made an utterance of I will love

(4:25:34) you forever they are now compelled to remain in love with that person forever people say these sorts of puffies in

(4:25:40) relationships I don't think that that's like coercive I gave my body to you based on knowledge that you lied about

(4:25:46) it's the same thing as you saying that I gave my body to you thinking that you

(4:25:51) were uh a woman when you're not it's coercion um I don't see how one is worse

(4:25:57) than the other I think it's both just as wrong just clarifying so when it comes to the trans thing uh if they're trans

(4:26:04) and they don't disclose that's like coercive or yeah you you said in the past that you you said that yeah you

(4:26:11) said that it um you would argue that it's sa which is the most minor amount of it

(4:26:18) is illegal to coers people into into sex it's illegal so um even though it's um

(4:26:25) socially acceptable if you look up the laws it's actually illegal to do that no one gets arrested for that most people

(4:26:31) don't get arrested for any essay um but if you look up coercion it is considered aay so do you think that if a man says

(4:26:38) to a woman I love you right and he's lying and then she sleeps with him

(4:26:45) should he go to jail no I don't I don't think they should I'm just saying it is illegal his essay for to lie about that

(4:26:52) to get since you brought the trans thing you said it is scientifically proven that gender isn't only male and female

(4:26:57) that's how would it be scientifically proven cuz there's um like biolog when you say science are you talking about

(4:27:03) biology yeah for gender um yeah gender doesn't pertain to biology it's a social

(4:27:10) concept I know I mean not g whatever sex sex that's what I mean by SE sex okay

(4:27:15) you said there are more intersex people than trans people out there I don't know if that's actually true but you said there are males no that's probably true

(4:27:21) it is true but no one cares about that but it's because it's because of the broad scope of of so it depends on what

(4:27:27) you classify as interx so there's two competing studies but anyway okay um you said there are males that can have

() 

(4:27:33) babies um technically um they would have to inseminate themselves but it is it is

(4:27:39) technically possible for for um in her sex person to get pregnant with their own oh no to impregnant themselves but

(4:27:47) yeah men do have babies look actually an interx phenomenon I'm not no the

(4:27:52) majority of the population don't know look it up it's not taught in biology I'm not disputing it I'm just going to

(4:27:59) clarify it yeah it's true when you say interex that doesn't actually mean you have two Sexes so things can fall under

(4:28:05) interex like a man has cancer they remove his testicles it UPS estrogen and he gets man boobs and that's considered

(4:28:13) intersect by some criteria so when it's gone through and it's re-evaluated for I don't remember if this was I think the

(4:28:19) stud's called steal but they went through and re-evaluated it and they took it from the Absurd percentage they

(4:28:25) had down to like .1% which was actually hang on which was

(4:28:30) actually intersex conditions it was point four you're not going to that there's a

(4:28:35) ton to get through so okay yeah um so I'm you you made a criticism about I

(4:28:42) make generalizations do you make like you avoid generalizations

(4:28:47) completely yeah I mean I try to let me read some of your notes here you said um

(4:28:53) I think this would even be a generalization I just read it men with no virtue are getting unhealthy ideas about relationships putting women in

(4:28:59) danger you mentioned the thing about domestic violence um and that men watching the show would be more inclined

(4:29:05) to like domestic violence that seems like a generalization you said that men thinking men thinking that these are

(4:29:10) your words that they only need to work a full-time job then they can just chill and play World of Warcraft in all their

(4:29:16) free time is the issue that seems like a general generalization towards men how's

(4:29:21) not you said men men thinking that they only need to work a full-time job then they can just chill and play World of

(4:29:27) Warcraft and all their free time is the issue so here's the Gen hold on so here's the generalization you made you were saying essentially that men in

(4:29:34) order to get women men think wrongly that all they need to do is have a

() 

(4:29:40) full-time job and they have to like not do anything besides just chill and play video games this seems like a total

(4:29:46) that's not what I meant bro [ __ ] words lady listen I've

(4:29:51) done if you want to just walk back every single position of yours this is your stated written position I'm going to

(4:29:58) tell you the reason I can't have a debate with somebody who wants to walk back all their [ __ ] position no 70% of divorces are from women right if you

(4:30:06) talk to the women who are having the divorces hold on hold on this is what's happening oh that's seems like a

(4:30:12) generalization yeah you so you wrote 70% of marriages are initiated by women but there's a reason for that you said

(4:30:18) domestic violence emotional abuse Financial abuse cheating substance abuse lack of intimacy and unequal division of

(4:30:24) house household responsibilities I've seen the stat that says it's 80% of marriages are uh the divorces initiated

(4:30:31) by women but I'm a little bit or you said 70% of marriages 70% of divorces are initiated by women um what

(4:30:38) percentage of divorces that are initiated by women fall into domestic vience emotional abuse Financial abuse cheating substance abuse lack of

(4:30:45) intimacy and unequal division of household responsibilities um I think all of them

(4:30:51) 4 40% was like um qualified as uh what What's the um the term is just like um

(4:30:59) differences what's the term they use that's like differences can you just scoot your mic to the edge of the table

(4:31:05) please um what's what's the term they use where it's like differences that you can't the the divorce term that that's

(4:31:12) um Iron differ so I think 40% was in reconcilable differences but that's like

(4:31:18) a broad statement so 60% of men who are getting divorced are like abusers no no

(4:31:23) no no I'd says like a generalization i' say this is some har rhetoric that putting out

(4:31:30) there that's going to result in domestic violence towards men from their female spouses 14% is abuse um from what I

(4:31:37) looked up it's 14% is um domestic violence I'm saying um if you look at

(4:31:42) the terms um uh yeah the majority of so I'm I'm addressing the whole

(4:31:48) generalization thing that you I've looked up stats you said then you said that then y'all men play victims on

(4:31:55) divorce the show who me yeah you always bring up

(4:32:01) that that we're stealing your money and I what that women are um

(4:32:07) like when the financial ramifications of divorce dis proportionately negative

(4:32:13) negatively impact men when it comes to alimony and child support that's true I I agree with that but women in marriage

(4:32:20) women in marriage we lose all of our Financial Freedom we we don't get disability um if we don't have

(4:32:28) disability not if you don't have work credits uh after divorce I'm disabled I

(4:32:33) know this so if you get married and you get divorced are you being paid

(4:32:39) alimony no and I live in Texas we don't have Alam money I'm not I'm not privy to

(4:32:44) the precise disability laws as it pertains to Texas talking as it relates to divorce and the impact divorce might

(4:32:51) have on your security disability oh yeah you can't get Social Security um

(4:32:56) disability you can get SSI which is like $500 a month but you can get Social Security Disability you get SSI but you

(4:33:03) can't get SSDI SSI is up to 534 bucks a month SSDI is it doesn't it does matter

(4:33:12) I I literally know divorced men who get SSDI yeah because they have work credits

(4:33:18) you have to have a certain amount of work credit so you're saying you didn't pay enough into the system yeah because if if you're at home with with the

(4:33:25) children and stuff and you get divorced no I

(4:33:30) don't I'm I'm you said that yeah we're on the argument of of I think I

(4:33:37) understand so the argument let me just make sure I got it right so the argument is women stay at home so they're not

(4:33:44) contributing to the workforce yeah so since they're not contributing to the workforce they don't put enough money into Social Security to draw the type of

(4:33:51) disability they would need if they became disabled yes okay and then men are four times more likely uh to leave a

(4:33:57) woman this would be the same thing with a state home Dad right yeah it would be yeah what was the fake study you were

(4:34:03) about to say men are more likely to leave their wives if they cancer or something no even like nurses and stuff

(4:34:08) they they talk about it it's it's not like a anotal stuff that's study was absolutely debunked this idea that men

(4:34:14) are like seven times more likely to leave their wies four times okay well the one I heard say seven I'm Prett the

(4:34:20) the study I'm familiar with four times all I'm saying is that there are

(4:34:26) issues because we leave the workforce and um it's harder to get a job if you haven't had a job in 20 years

(4:34:33) and you get divorced a hairdresser when in the early 2000s she gets divorced 20

(4:34:39) years later she can continue being a hair there's not she like then she can charge

(4:34:44) market rate for a haircut like idea off as like a bottom bottom level you lose

(4:34:50) your your status but that just seems like a great deal to me I don't even understand what the complaint is so like

(4:34:56) if the deal was presented to me you don't have to work but can stay home and

() 

(4:35:01) you stay home for a limited amount of time before your kids require less and less care the the more years that go by

(4:35:07) the less time that you actually have to spend caring for the kids right you'll be provisioned for for the rest of your

(4:35:13) life that's a great [ __ ] deal that's like a great deal I don't I don't know what the complaint there is it can be

(4:35:20) and if the marriage doesn't break up because the woman doesn't grow boss and say don't tell me what shoes I can [ __ ] buy which is what you're trying

(4:35:26) to say earlier right don't tell me what shoes I can buy know so so your whole criticism was that essentially boiled

(4:35:33) down to when I pushed you repeatedly about like what is the harmful rhetoric what is the harm I'm causing is you make

(4:35:39) generalizing statements about men I'll read another generalizing statement you made you said that y'all men play

(4:35:45) victims on divorce men want us to stay home and raise kids but don't see any Financial value in that true that seems

(4:35:52) like a generalization I'm saying from what y'all say on the show I'm making the my statements based off on the I

(4:35:59) mean first off I well actually no there would be a financial value to woman staying home and raising the kids that

(4:36:05) way it frees you up as the man to go out and kill it and provide for the entire

(4:36:10) family but in addition to that we're not looking at stay-at-home uh wives or

(4:36:15) whatever it is through through the lens of the financial value of that we're

(4:36:20) looking at it through the familial value that you're providing yeah but let's

(4:36:26) from things I've seen on him he'll on the show I can't quote you but you were

(4:36:32) like laughing like that it was a minuscule Mount oh like they clean and do this like oh like I've actually been

(4:36:38) married and raised tons of kids you no but I was a nanny for 12 years and

(4:36:45) worked 60 hours a week that's great I've worked 60 hours a week most of my life raising other people's families I know

(4:36:50) no raising my own family I have my own children are you going to get are I'm sorry you going to take a shot at me because I'm willing because I'm willing

(4:36:56) to take care of other people and my own what does that have to do with what I said so here's the thing just so that

(4:37:02) you understand right I've raised many children from the age that they were

(4:37:07) little tiny kids to the age of adulthood I've raised children and I'm telling you

(4:37:14) that it's not that [ __ ] hard this job that women complain about is not that hard to do the every year that goes by

(4:37:21) it gets less hard than the year before the same is not true of a man's work I mean every year that goes by it doesn't

(4:37:27) get less difficult than the year before I would disagree on a lot of that um once you put yourself up in higher

(4:37:34) positions you should be working it's way more no do you think that adding responsibility I'm sorry so add

(4:37:41) responsibility to a man so he's in a higher position that's less hard work I

(4:37:47) just want to make sure I got that clear if you're doing things correctly then you should be working less same as women

(4:37:53) as a kids get older no as you get into positions of authority your responsibility gets higher you do more

(4:38:00) work not L work does Brian work harder with this podcast and works once a week or whatever no right I'm just saying I'm

(4:38:07) saying you own businesses that's [ __ ] crazy wait you own businesses we stay at home and own businesses yeah

() 

(4:38:14) they can write they can do all sorts of things what are you talking about I'm talking about different jobs my job tell

(4:38:20) me what you're about to say about I do a show about business owners the mic keep

(4:38:25) the mic at the edge of the table it's not comfortable for me I'm talking about business owners ver what what was you saying about

(4:38:31) how you're a business owner me what were you saying about me I'm saying that if you're doing it right you shouldn't have

(4:38:37) to work as much I've been working 80 hours if you do it right as a mother you

(4:38:43) shouldn't have to work as much true what right wait so you think I'm like my job's easy no I didn't say it was you

(4:38:50) sound I know social media is hard oh he does a show once a week I'm talking owners the farther you get up you can

(4:38:56) hire people to allocate those so more responsibility so more responsibility more people look after but you can

(4:39:01) afford to pay other people to do this so and so you're paying people who are now

(4:39:07) in an underling management position to you and then you are overseeing all of

(4:39:12) them yeah you hire other people Who oversee them and then you have to oversee them yeah it's like this great

(4:39:19) people I I know oh the people I know that are 40

(4:39:25) plus who own businesses they worked really really hard and worked like 80 hour weeks until where they got to the

(4:39:32) point where they finally finally didn't have to do that anymore and they start

(4:39:37) traveling they start doing all of yes that's true you can have some of the fruits of the reward but I guarantee you

(4:39:42) none of those business people working less hard than they did 20 years ago in fact they're usually working way harder

(4:39:47) they're usually way more stressed out they have way more people who depend on them for paycheck when you have people

(4:39:52) actually depend on you so imagine this from the man's perspective now only do you have your family who depends on you children who depend on you wife who

(4:39:58) depends on you now you have other people's family who also depend on you like me I have multiple employees all of

(4:40:05) their families get fed through me right my family gets fed through me my job has

(4:40:10) not become less difficult at all and in fact as I become more successful it's

(4:40:16) going to get more difficult not less difficult well I mean the people I've

(4:40:22) dated well yeah I I own a small uh um

(4:40:28) bartending company and I bartending company yeah and and I'm I'm also getting into Airbnb rentals and it this

(4:40:35) pertains to that when you first start out do you think I only work one day a week no I didn't say that it kind of

(4:40:41) cut me off you cut me off when before I even got a chance no you were trying to move on you were zipping on to the next

(4:40:48) thing you do I was trying to make a point about why did you bring up me

(4:40:53) having a show once a week because I was talking about business owners and you went from two shows a week to one show a

(4:40:59) week didn't you recently and yeah you're working less as a business own I'm actually working just

(4:41:06) about the same amount I mean I don't know your free time but I've dated

(4:41:12) my work time has not been cut in half even though I've gone down from two shows a week to one show a week do you

(4:41:19) hope in your bartending business that you're going to have more employees yeah yeah do you think that's going to be less work oh it's definitely

(4:41:26) less work cuz I still get paid whether I work or not and do you think you you think it's going to be less work to

(4:41:32) manage those employees and manage your customers and manage your customers you think so yeah um when it pertains to

(4:41:38) Airbnb when you first start off you have to Al all of you have to hire all bro

(4:41:44) it's so insulting for a woman to that I work like 12 like 10 hour days every sing I don't take a day off I haven't

(4:41:50) vacationed in the past 3 years and some like entitled woman comes on the show saying that oh you just do one show a

(4:41:56) week you have no [ __ ] idea how hard finish I'm talking about business owners it's just really ins own it's just

(4:42:02) really [ __ ] insulting cut you just do one show we just stroll

(4:42:08) into the podcast studio and that's me that's just so first all how am I entitled but you cut me off before I

(4:42:14) even finish what I was saying you cut me you've cut me off a bunch yeah but like that you're assuming what I was saying before you even let me finish and how am

(4:42:21) I entitled hey I got a vacation how am I entitled to De bcon because they they'

(4:42:27) flying me and Rachel out anyway so I just went ahead and made that you know work trip a vacation be the one that I

(4:42:34) was working at from my experience in business is you can pay other people to

(4:42:41) do certain things the higher you go up and eventually you become what does your business bring in a

(4:42:48) year not not that much yeah it's probably not a lot of experience in your in your business I'm talking I from

(4:42:55) other people I know I'm saying that in general you can say the higher you go up

(4:43:00) the more employees you have and eventually you don't have to work if you don't want to and you can if you choose

(4:43:06) to yeah usually when you get to if you get to the point where you are I don't know um a extremely rich extremely

(4:43:15) wealthy business owner you have multiple employees you can Outsource most of your stuff this and that you're like

(4:43:20) 60 okay yeah you're like 60 you're like 70 you're not you're not young anymore

(4:43:25) you're not expanding your business no I get it when you get older yeah that's when you start to have the freedoms yeah

(4:43:31) but business here's here's what actually happens in business you start small it sucks you put your nose to the GD Stone

(4:43:37) you usually don't get paid for the first three years for the first three years you don't take a dime and any dimes you

(4:43:43) do get you reinvest it back in the business and Equipment cost things like this and you do all the work yourself and then what happens is one day you

(4:43:49) maybe catch a break and you get a few extra contracts and you do all those yourself too reinvest in your business

(4:43:55) and you still take no money for another year I get that eventually maybe you get to the point where you're one of the few

(4:44:00) lucky business owners who can afford to have employees which is very rare most people can't even do that in business or

(4:44:06) if they do they fail immediately because that's most of the pay that you pay out is going to be to your employees right

(4:44:13) it's way more work the way more PE the more people you add the more contracts you have or you wouldn't need employees

(4:44:18) it always becomes more work and they call in sick then you have to go in and do their job and then ex it it does not

(4:44:24) get easier because you manage more people gets harder I mean then I think

(4:44:30) those businesses aren't doing that great I'm going to bring it back to the generalizations here um would you rather

(4:44:37) cross paths with a man or a bear in the forest I thought this was just funny because I'm tired of that question

(4:44:44) um and my argument is that a bear wouldn't ask me stupid questions like

() 

(4:44:50) that and second ofely only three to five uh there's only three to five bear deaths a year and there's about like

(4:44:56) 15,000 I think murders from males per year so if it's a random man or Stat

(4:45:02) it's just statistically I'm more likely to get hared you said random man random bear

(4:45:09) why would I not listen to statistics your your answer is be though okay yeah I mean I don't and realistically I don't

(4:45:15) know M happen for people you know my only answer is because so you think it's

(4:45:20) it's interesting though you've made a criticism of me of generalizing women and when I asked you what you say things

(4:45:26) like oh women uh I I say things or at least you allege that I say that women want uh men who only have money and

(4:45:34) Status Etc you know what I find more egregious than that is you think

(4:45:41) that you're making generalization about men you've painted basically if you choose bear over man you're making a

(4:45:48) generalization about men to the point that you think it's safer to be in a forest stop you literally just said bear

(4:45:55) you think it's stop stop stop let me finish you think it's it's safer to be

(4:46:01) in the forest alone with a random bear a wild animal over a random man that is

(4:46:09) mandry that is is man-hating you clearly have an anti-al bi yeah do you see me laughing I'm not

(4:46:16) serious about my answer am I I said statistically why would I if you look

(4:46:22) online about statistics so your your only statistic your answer is your

(4:46:27) answer bare or not statistically yes so it so you are serious then if you look

(4:46:33) at statistics I'm not a m a man hater statistically yes does it do you know

(4:46:39) what per capita is per capita like the amount of people yeah per capita so how many be

(4:46:46) encounters do you think the like average person has throughout the course of their lifetime I don't know there's no statistics on that I just said my answer

(4:46:52) is only statistics how many bears I'm not a man how many bears have you encountered

(4:46:59) multiple I I've done a lot yeah you've done a lot with bears no I I've done

(4:47:04) I've done a lot of camping and a lot of traveling you've encountered Bears black bears yes they're they're not that and

(4:47:11) you did you go up and pet them on the head no I wouldn't you wouldn't do that I wouldn't go pet around man on the head either have you how many men have you uh

(4:47:18) like walked past or met in your entire life all I know is that I've been abused by multiple men and I haven't been

(4:47:23) abused by bear perfect okay perfect so let's take this to its logical conclusion let's say there's an

(4:47:29) individual who had bad experiences with somebody who was Black or Mexican and

(4:47:35) because they had one two or three bad experiences with somebody who's Black or Mexican they now do not want they're

(4:47:42) fearful of all black people are all Mexicans is that is that racist yeah

(4:47:48) cool so you're sexist congratulations my answer first thing I said was a joke I

(4:47:53) said because dude man dudes won't ask stupid questions like this cool and then that's a joke actually not a stupid

(4:47:59) question that's a joke it's not a stupid question the whole reason it's a temperature check to see if you're a

(4:48:04) sexist I'm not a sexist you literally would rather be in the for You' rather be alone serious oh my you can't walk

(4:48:11) back yes you are because you said based off statistics statistically yes and if I actually went in person no probably

(4:48:18) not by myself no I told you be I was laughing when I said it you can't walk

(4:48:24) back every single position not everything is black and white get pushed back not everything is black and

(4:48:30) white oh I agree not everything black and white look most things have Nuance but the thing is I'm saying

(4:48:36) statistically you ask yes or no answers don't you so you can't say I'm walking back when you ask details in that stupid

(4:48:43) questionnaire I lit did you ask the details when you ask yes or no questions it's a hypothetical question would you

(4:48:49) rather cross pads with a men or a bear in the forest those are the details I like to give more here I'll

(4:48:57) give you I'll give you a better like how many more if it was a polar bear I'd definitely choose a I'll make it really

(4:49:02) simple you randomly spawn in the forest two buttons also randomly spawn in the

(4:49:08) forest with you buttons on the button left and button right yeah buttons that you can press so you can press to spawn

(4:49:15) in a random man of the entire US population an adult man or you can press

(4:49:20) the other button which will spawn in a random bear and it can be any of any uh

(4:49:25) uh species of bear that live in the United States I would adult bear I would choose the man if when you say the woods

(4:49:34) it specify it makes it seem that it would be if it's a forest I I assume

(4:49:40) that would be black bear or a grizzly bear the most dangerous bear is a polar bear right those are the ones that

(4:49:46) actually bears are pretty [ __ ] dangerous yeah those are the on black

(4:49:51) there's literally in California a woman was attack I think either attacked or killed Yeah by a black bear but listen

(4:49:58) there has to be a a baby bear most of the time um if it's a black bear they're defending their cubs if there's one bear

(4:50:05) it suggests that are you would you be down to take um like an IQ test on the

(4:50:12) podcast right now cuz you said like when you in fifth grade you took an IQ test and it was

(4:50:17) like 149 no I said 143 a real IQ test takes a large amount of time if you want

(4:50:24) to dedicate a couple hours you can do you can do what is called a baseline IQ test so it's not going to be 100%

(4:50:32) accurate right but it'll usually get you within about 10 points or so it's called

(4:50:37) a baseline IQ test so I've taken I've taken legitimate IQ tests like you I agree with you they take mine took I

(4:50:42) think about about 4 and 1/2 hours but hang on you can do a streamline IQ test

(4:50:48) and what that does is just based on uh sampling of questions it can get you at least within a range so it's going to

(4:50:55) get you at least in a Range I mean I I guess so I'm a little

(4:51:00) drunk but sure let's do it let's do it you had like half a cup of champagne

(4:51:07) yeah I also take a bunch of medication and I drink like one every 3 months she said what I'm I'm disabled dude I have

(4:51:14) to take medication but you don't got a drink babe yeah that's true yeah I don't

(4:51:20) have to drink you don't have to drink with the medication but yeah I have to live at some point and if I drink once every couple months that that's okay if

(4:51:26) I drink every day and I take medications then then that wouldn't be okay is it ADHD is that the uh disability uh oh no

(4:51:34) no I'm dyslectic ADHD I have ERS D DLo syndrome I have pots I have um yeah pots

() 

(4:51:41) is terrible yeah I have pots I have uh asthma I have um rheumatoid arthritis I

(4:51:47) have mcast they can't work I no I I do I have to be very I have to um think

(4:51:55) outside the box with work because you collect disability no I don't collect disability why do you have no none no no

(4:52:03) no okay I own a house um no I don't collect disability I at first I was I

(4:52:08) used to not be able to walk and stuff and I just had to slowly work up to not being a victim and um pushing myself to

(4:52:17) do things I didn't think I ever could do and now I use power tools I cut my own trees I I do all my housework um I

(4:52:26) meaning like um you cut down trees yeah I I cut down like five just last week

(4:52:32) what's the process you use for cutting down a tree um chainsaws and yeah no but I mean with the chainsaw what do you do

(4:52:38) with the chainsaw to cut it down yeah I don't I don't know why I'm doing I just do it yeah but W thick Tre they

(4:52:45) weren't thick trees yeah but tell me how you do it I use the chainsaw yeah I know but what do you do with the chainsaw to

(4:52:51) cut it down use the chainsaw yeah how there's a there's a

(4:52:58) way that you use a chainsaw to cut a tree down I'm not saying I did it properly yeah I know so which way did

(4:53:03) you do it I turned it on and I used it they're they're tiny trees it's not

(4:53:09) like I'm cutting know like gigantic normal things and I use other saws too I use the uh whatever saw it's um it just

(4:53:17) goes straight out a little bit it's rectangle no it's tiny a jacksa

(4:53:23) a what's it called a um if y'all can Google I don't know the

(4:53:29) name of the saw but the majority of it um is like a tiny

(4:53:36) saw what's the saw look like it it goes out like six seven inches and has riged

(4:53:43) things and you just turn it on and you put it

(4:53:48) through is it shaped like this no it it's shaped like a like a knife with uh

(4:53:54) a button on the end like that goes like this a Jags saw jigsaw an like an

(4:54:00) electric saw is it electric no this one had a battery um 21 volt battery what is

(4:54:07) it called a um I I don't know I don't know what reference yeah yeah I mean the majority of which I used

(4:54:14) smaller items and went chunk by chunk yeah don't try to cut down bigger trees you're going to really hurt yourself bad

(4:54:20) no I I yeah I YouTube things um there's definitely limits to all of my like DIY

(4:54:28) produ projects but I can see that but yeah I would definitely uh not take a

(4:54:33) saw a chainsaw to another tree if I were you ever that's small trees like how

(4:54:40) small like 7 ftt small around like small around and

(4:54:48) they're 7 ft tall yeah it's like bushes can't see we can't see those are bushes

(4:54:54) any tree that I could touch the top of is a bush can you guys um and then I trimmed I trimmed the bigger trees and

(4:55:01) went like 15 down one chair uh we have a uh that was a walk-off I don't know if

(4:55:06) we'd consider that a rage quit oh but she just left do I I have several

() 

(4:55:12) different um different types of um Power Tools I've used all of them I haven't

(4:55:20) cut a hand off and I would I think that the majority of men would probably be in

(4:55:25) the same position as me in this day and age of just going for it just going for

(4:55:32) it okay uh so yeah quick announcement guys that was a we had a walkoff from Kenzie um she probably felt that she

(4:55:39) wasn't able to get a word in um would have been good to uh have gone through

(4:55:45) some stuff with her to be fair she uh kind of came in a little hot on Andrew and I

(4:55:53) had to shut her down pretty quick and then people have a tendency to um see

(4:55:59) people have a tendency once you've uh I mean that was a really buzz kill thing to say at the top of the show yeah that

(4:56:06) was pretty brutal um so then I wasn't being very charitable with allowing her to

(4:56:13) participate in the conversation because within 5 minutes or whatever of the show

(4:56:18) starting she used a word that we try to avoid and it's also just kind of a without the proper context the

(4:56:24) conversation a really disgusting accusation to Lev so the one who was sitting over there freaked out and which

(4:56:31) caused the freak out which caused the freak out and then she cried and then

(4:56:36) Kenzie walked out that's that's a pretty good recap of

(4:56:42) the situation anybody else but but I'm telling you anybody else had that situation had she not said that stupid

(4:56:49) little quip that girl would like it wouldn't have led to the whole situation with that girl it was like a cascading

(4:56:56) domino effect of like that's what Rachel said Rachel Rachel texted me and was like she she she placed that in there

(4:57:04) and was totally um she thought she was pushing for it she's like I don't trust her at all so just just pointing that

(4:57:11) out she thought it was tactical oh like she did that intentionally I think it was inevitable

(4:57:17) for her to act like that because it was just about interuption her yes it would have gone there probably

(4:57:24) eventually but um just be really careful behind you because there's a tri just be really careful there's a tripod right

(4:57:30) behind you clumsy I'm clumsy um that would have happened

(4:57:36) inevitably um sorry guys uh but this year I think what she said was

(4:57:44) like this sort of intentional thing to just totally sour like you don't say that at the [ __ ] top of a show and I

(4:57:50) don't know um so she did leave guys um

(4:57:56) and it I had the similar situation you know uh stra aade Ain I never actually

() 

(4:58:02) met her I don't think I've been trying dude she's been dodging a debate with you for a year I've been trying to do a

(4:58:08) One V one get her for a One V one debate she's like reach out in a month a month a couple months now she's like doing the

(4:58:13) whole pixie [ __ ] oh yeah that whole Destiny nonsense cuz she's an Orbiter too she's been do dodging you for months

(4:58:19) but she came on and did the same thing and totally falsely accused me of saying something I didn't say and it just

(4:58:24) totally sour the mood it was literally at the top like I think it was early on

(4:58:30) in the show I'm pretty sure and she was like oh didn't you like say that uh something about gang rape I'm like what

(4:58:38) yeah just like some I was like no I said gang bang and it was like what it was rid anyways whatever totally ridiculous

(4:58:44) they love to just um totally be Buzz kills and ruin the show um so we're

(4:58:50) going to get through I guess the rest of the notes Here uh we're going to do the questionnaire so goodbye

(4:58:57) Kenzie uh okay so uh what would you want the minimum yearly income to be for your

(4:59:02) future husband like 50 60 okay what about you

(4:59:49) up on 90 a year $90,000 a year that's

(4:59:55) really good pay M yeah content creation it ain't no $300,000 a year not but my

(5:00:00) business is going to get better I'm going to keep doubling my pay every year as a model so I'm confident double the

(5:00:43) bottom if they have goals and dreams then as much as they can do I mean 80,000 is not unreasonable for if you

(5:00:49) want to have in California if you want to like have a baseline family that's

(5:00:55) not unreasonable to be searching for I don't think but 300,000 is like that's such top deer like what you're asking

(5:01:01) for there it's a really high percentage 1% is like 450,000 oh yeah well 300,000

(5:01:08) you're already getting into that really high top percentile yeah that is a that extraordinary amount

(5:01:16) of money that most people just never make it's that much per year are you are you a 1% woman 560 this last year huh

(5:01:24) for top 1% went up to like 560 I think this sure are you a 1% woman um can you

(5:01:30) explain to me what that means well you want a 1% guy in terms of his maybe it's like 2% two top 2% guy in terms of

(5:01:37) income are you a top 2% woman that's not um mandatory no but what's not mandatory

(5:01:45) it's got to be mandatory at the minimum oh for the 300 that's that's

(5:01:50) 2% top 2% that's top 2% men then yes you're a 2% woman okay um all

(5:01:59) right uh how tall are you and what's the minimum height of a man you would date go ahead I don't I don't have one so

(5:02:07) you it's possible I've had one on me um I don't care if they've hit on you I've

(5:02:12) dated people shorter than me uh multiple yeah would would you prefer taller or shorter um taller

(5:02:19) yeah um wait question uh you said you were your longest relationship was uh

(5:02:25) four years yeah and was that the one you were married to oh I was I haven't been married wait he was 5'5 as well I'm just

(5:02:33) saying can see what married he was 5'5 so I was I'm confident she said she was married never married you she said she's

(5:02:41) been divorced what are you talking about yo chat don't chat don't lie what did

(5:02:48) Chad did she say she's been divorced I could have no I would never say that

(5:02:53) I've never been divorced never been married you said it though said she's

(5:02:58) divorced I don't think she said it I think y had said it and I don't think she picked up on it when said it she did I've never been no I promise you okay

(5:03:06) then you might have been okay fine you misspoke fine whatever no I did misspoke I never said it maybe he didn't maybe he

(5:03:11) didn't wait why would say how much are you willing to wager uh $33,000 I could

(5:03:17) have $3,000 Shake on it Brian I could have sworn she said she

(5:04:07) um when people get divorced uh men when they're like oh she took all

(5:04:12) like half my money and all it they don't um think of small things like that were

(5:04:19) um when you're out of the workforce consequences of that and that was my point in that okay um so you would date

(5:07:33) did sorry this is a three-way a threeway contract there's a contract the first

(5:07:38) three-way I've been in a Jer a j a j okay um going around the

(5:07:45) table how tall are you and what's the minimum height of a man you would date I don't know if we heard it 5'9 um either 5'9 or 510 okay what about you um I am

(5:07:54) 5'7 so probably like 6 foot okay what about you I'm 5'2 and I

(5:08:01) said 5'8 minimum 5'8 okay what about about you I'm 5'6 I say 5'8 um I date my

(5:08:06) height but you know prob better all right um

(5:08:11) finding uh okay and then there was oh would you rather cross paths with a man or bear in the forest you said bear what

(5:08:17) about you I would say bear okay what about you also bear man man okay uh I'm

(5:08:26) not going to really Linger on the bare one but um you're all sexists all three of you no I don't know could kill you a

(5:08:34) man could grape you like a bear a bear's not going to Grape you and like if you could

(5:08:40) I'd rather be killed an animal like a bear you know might do you don't know what a bear is capable of the man to

(5:08:46) protect you from the bear but like I don't know if you run into a man in the forest like you could

() 

(5:08:53) trust I got okay let me try this question just real quick cuz she brings up a good point I'm wondering about this

(5:09:00) let's say you picked the bear okay and you spawned in the forest and the bear was super aggressive okay and it was

(5:09:07) like and [ __ ] and it was and and you were running away from the bear and you happened to sight a man who was also a

(5:09:13) complete stranger would you ask him for help would you shout for help yeah I would shout for help to the man yeah now

(5:09:21) if you were running away from the man would you shout to a bear for help no but just I don't know it's just it's a

(5:09:28) different scenario right I'm just saying I'm just pointing out right like the very thing that you think makes the man

(5:09:34) dangerous which is that he has the reason capability of like torturing you to death for instance let's let's say

(5:09:40) right he also has reason and capability to not do that he's not operating on

(5:09:45) instincts like they can be reasoned with as well yeah you just never know and I think of a man also spawned into a

(5:09:52) forest with a woman the last thing on his mind would BSA and the first thing on his mind would be like why the [ __ ]

(5:09:57) am I here and who the [ __ ] are you just like that would be you know what I mean the first thing on your mind you'd be

(5:10:02) like uh how did I get here not oh Nobody's around finally you

(5:10:09) know what that's just I don't know it just seems so unreasonable to me uh let's see here uh do you have any

(5:10:15) disagreements with the show we already went about over 10% I don't know somebody wrote 10% disagreements um no

(5:10:23) we shall see prenups um here I'm going to get into the rest of the show notes here so uh let's see Ashley you said uh that

(5:10:31) you're a submissive woman in your appre notes yeah uh you your question is you

(5:10:37) wanted to ask are your standards too high because you said you haven't really you've never had a boyfriend never dated

(5:10:42) anyone you've never gone on a date although you do include here that you've been asked out you've tried to give

(5:10:48) people here maybe put me in frame um you've tried to give people chances but can never follow through with the dates

(5:10:55) or past the talking stage you said there's 600 plus guys in your hidden folder on hinge I'm assuming yeah uh but

() 

(5:11:02) never been in relationship uh and then you also say genuinely never been on an actual date you've been asked out had

(5:11:08) people try but you you can just never follow through with it and the 600 people Plus in on hinge because you lose

(5:11:14) interest or get nothing from it um so when you say that you're uh like are

(5:11:20) what are your standards I guess I don't know I mean I I feel like when I talk about it it's the bare minimum I just

(5:11:26) ask for respect I ask someone who can help provide for me I ask for someone who can show me compassion and show me

(5:11:32) you know like I say I'm not in it for the intimacy I you know one of my love langages is physical touch but I mean

(5:11:39) that along the lines of holding my hand just showing that you know you appreciate me I mean that's all I ask for genuinely and I just feel like I can

(5:11:46) never get that I mean even appearance we talk about appearances are such a big thing like you can't have a relationship

(5:11:52) with someone if you're not the slightest bit attracted to them and you know I try and have a relationship with someone I

(5:11:57) try and get to know someone and it just it just always falls through like and so you're saying you're just not physically attracted to the guys yeah I I honestly

(5:12:05) I don't attract them men that like I I see is it so is it the men that like you

(5:12:11) you don't like them and the guys that you like they don't like you yeah and I

(5:12:17) I don't know if it's something I'm doing something I'm giving off um I I've replayed it in my head you know

(5:12:22) everyone's like oh like the right guy's out there for you like all that stuff I'm like okay well I haven't drawn it in

(5:12:29) I mean I haven't you know I haven't seen it okay um you let's see in the rest of

(5:12:35) your notes here you said uh guys can go on about their ex being crazy but they go after them for their appearance not

(5:12:41) personality I have no sympathy I think it's more often that like the girls go after like the girls will say oh my ex

(5:12:47) was such a jerk [ __ ] he was abusive blah blah blah I feel like you could say the same thing about women I men tend to

(5:12:55) avoid like I don't men don't want crazy I could say it's a two-way streak I

(5:13:00) would say it's a um a male and a female thing that I hear a lot of guys talk about how I mean just from my

(5:13:06) perspective cuz I'm talking to you know a guy that their exes are you know BS crazy and all that stuff and I'm like

(5:13:13) that's because you got drawn in from the way they look because of the beauty of a woman you don't actually get to know them for who they are so you're in a

(5:13:19) relationship with them and you find out that they're crazy and all that stuff well you know I have no sympathy like

(5:13:25) you're in a long-term relationship with them and you find out that they're psychotic well you didn't truly get to know the person for who they were you

(5:13:31) started getting into the relationship because of the way they looked I kind of have to disagree with Brian here a little bit so he's right me don't I

(5:13:38) guess generally want crazy but I think they'll put up with crazy if they're sleeping with them yeah right especially

(5:13:44) at your age right they'll put up with that for in in exchange for sex but uh

(5:13:50) from you that's not what they're getting yeah right because you're waiting till marriage good by the way good but the

(5:13:57) point is is like so if there's any crazy involved right and there's nothing that

(5:14:02) they're getting out of it physically yeah like from their do I have to offer like I don't have nothing to offer yeah

(5:14:09) so from their perspective it whittles down the options right wait we have an update here on the did she say the thing

(5:14:17) that she did indeed say it when it hold on let me wait wait let's not do it it's

(5:14:24) way too where's the where's the clip one sec

() 

(5:14:31) here no you shouldn't very simple alignment with goals is different than getting married my goal is to have a

(5:14:38) woman no no no no hold on I didn't say it it's not guys chat hold on chat fake

(5:14:45) news hold on guys she said she was married or

(5:14:52) divorced not did she utter the word married or

(5:14:57) divorced we're not going to play some it has to be she said that she was married

(5:15:03) or she was divorced okay they asked that in the beginning so they can go to the way beginning to find

(5:15:10) it to make a determination that a woman needs to have her own money for ex how

(5:15:16) do you determine that just make it up I wasn't an for 10 plus years I made way I was married for 10 plus years I can't

(5:15:22) say that I slur my words right there I was married for 10 plus a nanny I was a nanny for 10 plus years Nanny Nan I slur

(5:15:30) my words y'all speech impediment I it was hard job why would we get married C

(5:15:36) job and I wouldn't want you to get married to me I mean I I was talking about being a nanny wait hold on there's

(5:15:43) more to the clip I have 3,000 no I didn't get 3,000 be

(5:15:50) 200 because I was for above theal average see I'm talking

(5:15:56) about our job being I know you didn't say it there but there's going to be some more Clips coming through because I'm so [ __ ] my speech impediment may

(5:16:05) have got me $200 so slow it down I never said

(5:16:12) it just because those clips didn't show it because perhaps they misheard it it could be the case that you very well did

(5:16:18) say it unfortunately we don't have the evidence yet but that doesn't mean it won't come in so continue can I ask a

(5:16:24) follow-up to my do do you think I'm wrong for believing that most men are only in it for um intimacy and like how

(5:16:31) we were talk I mean what's the percentage like is is it I know they're out there but how I said I'm my I'm

(5:16:37) attracted to maybe 10% of men in the range of 20 to 50 I'm not into older men I attract a lot of older men then I also

(5:16:43) when you but you said in the range of 20 to 50 I remember age range you were saying 20 to 50 age range I said I may

(5:16:49) be attracted to 10% of them oh okay but you said do you would you date an older guy like in his 30s

(5:16:56) um I attract a lot of people in that I'm not necessarily attracted to them okay

(5:17:01) so so probably you want to date within your age range I would say yeah maybe like 26 27 Max Max okay that makes I

(5:17:09) think you're going to maybe struggle here in so far as you said you want to like wait for your Forever person uh but

(5:17:15) you're not a virgin that's going to add some complications there you are a Christian uh I think there are probably

(5:17:21) a greater proportion of Christian men who are like they're not virgins you're not a virgin they're okay with like waiting longer periods of time or even

(5:17:27) waiting until uh marriage but uh yeah most guys don't want to uh most guys

(5:17:35) just they want to have sex and the hard part is I won't get into like the Christianity stuff but a lot of people who say that they're Christians they

(5:17:41) still have a lot of lust when it comes to having intimacy with a woman and so even trying to open up to someone who is

(5:17:47) a Christian which I would love to find a um a man of God that's genuinely what I'm looking for that's even hard to even

(5:17:53) trust them because they're still into you know blessful sins yeah I feel like guys lust more than they love like they

(5:17:59) lust first before they even love I agree and uh let's go to oh you said you would

(5:18:05) take a bullet for your significant other this is a disagreement with me because I'm because of my position on the bullet

(5:18:10) thing um yeah I would honestly I would take a bullet for a lot of people um but I would 100% take a bullet for my

(5:18:16) significant other um whether they wouldn't want me to or not I would still expect them to offer try and like push

(5:18:22) me out of the way defend me as someone who I am submissive to a man I want them to defend me in any way that they can

(5:18:28) but I would do the same just because that's the type of person I am I would 100% say I don't think men should should uh take the bullet for the

(5:18:34) woman I think that they should I wouldn't say necessarily take a wife

(5:18:40) wife yeah wife no not for the wife either no no no no I'm not taking the bullet um but

(5:18:49) do you believe in a man defending a woman like standing up for them fight look the the assessment here is in a

(5:18:55) situation where somebody has to die I'm not taking the bullet but but you could

(5:19:00) get beaten to death in a fight for your kids if I remember right yes yes okay

(5:19:06) most likely is it my daughter or it's your so it's your son it's my son

(5:19:13) definitely um but uh he didn't say that he was joking but

(5:19:20) but the uh this this idea that um would I like if there was a home

(5:19:25) invasion yeah he the the person who's invading the home can get dead like I'm

(5:19:31) going to defend my family yeah but in some scenario where it's like the Grim

(5:19:36) Reaper it's like you or your wife you can take the wife you would you would

(5:19:42) push your wife I mean you'd be like take the wife I mean I would take myself come on some funking I'm on gangas Khan [ __ ]

(5:19:48) sort of like you why why has the man this is a generation of women who are

(5:19:55) the least submissive the most promiscuous the most involved in sex work the most liberal the most Progressive the most just everything

(5:20:03) confused the most everything counter to chivalry and you want me to take the

(5:20:10) bullet I'm sorry it's not going to happen maybe you can when when how about

(5:20:15) this men should take the bullet women should remain virgins until they meet their guy and they stay with them

(5:20:20) indefinitely sure but you can't use you're not a virgin not a oh wait I am a virgin she's a virgin my bad I got I was

(5:20:26) I was going to do my thing but you are a virgin not a virgin not a virgin not a virgin but how can you make that place I

(5:20:32) mean you're not a virgin but you're also it's your wife exactly I'm not a virgin so yeah yeah yeah but you're using that

(5:20:39) claim as women should stay virgins all that stuff well I also think that that's counteractive how men can have high body counts and look for a lower body count

(5:20:45) women but we're not talking about random women talking about wife I don't even understand what you're arguing so like

(5:20:51) look I'll show I'll explain let's say Brian his wife the Grim Reaper does show up and he's taking one of them all right

(5:20:58) let's say in this hypothetical scenario Brian's 10 years younger and it's you and him and you're married in this

() 

(5:21:06) configuration right what do you tell the Grim re take me okay and so Brian says take you

(5:21:13) so I don't understand what's the problem then I expect him to stand up for me too

(5:21:18) though I would 100% allow how then how do you make how do you come to the conclusion then as to who the Grim

(5:21:24) preper takes I would say me but I would hope that my husband would act right so

(5:21:29) secretly you're saying one thing when you actually want the other thing yes

(5:21:35) yes yes but his he he uses the excuse or not the excuse but he uses the argument that women I me he listed everything

(5:21:42) that a woman should be but in the context of that we're talking about your wife we're not

(5:21:47) talking about a random woman who's promiscuous who yeah but think logically like here's the logical that's what

(5:21:52) we're doing we're trying to figure it out logically right yeah if your claim is I would want it to be me and Brian's

(5:21:58) like good okay it's you and you're like but wait I actually want it to be you

(5:22:03) you're contradicting yourself no I would want it to be me and I would let it be me but I think it's the ACT of showing

(5:22:10) showing that he wants to defend me show I mean him wanting to stand up for me so then how do we decide who goes I would

(5:22:15) allow it to be so like all roads lead back to if you

(5:22:21) really would take the bullet right yeah the GM Reaper is now here you can't get

(5:22:26) mad cuz he's like all right then I would never be mad it's it's the action of showing him defending me I think that is

(5:22:33) all I ask for like I mean him standing up from me is just what I asked for but I would ultimately would you rather date

(5:22:39) a guy who's honest about it or a guy who virtue signals a guy who virtue signals oh yeah

(5:22:47) I would I would take the I would take the bullet and then he actually wouldn't take the bullet like at least with me

(5:22:53) you know that's true what you're getting a lot of guys talk a big game about like oh I would do ever I would sacrifice my

(5:23:00) life for my wom bro especially these player dudes like Andrew Tate says this I would I would sacrifice my life for

(5:23:06) one of my Romanian girlfriends get the [ __ ] out of here

(5:23:11) Andrew Tate is not sacrificing his life to defend one of his Romanian porn star

(5:23:18) girlfriends that's absolutely ridiculous and these men who virtue signal oh it's man's Duty it's [ __ ] [ __ ] it's

(5:23:25) virtue signaling and it's total [ __ ] C but we're not talking about a just random girlfriend that you have we're

(5:23:31) talking about your wife we're talking about someone who's been submissive to you someone whoow to you someone who would be there for you provide for your

(5:23:37) family provide I mean yeah I can just get another wife Ian whatever just to add to that so

(5:23:44) if she doesn't if she doesn't fall into that category of reasons why you wouldn't take a bullet for her if she

(5:23:51) doesn't fall into those categories you still wouldn't do it at all like I don't care how amazing she is if the condition

(5:23:57) here look let me frame it like this if you were to tell me Brian I'm willing how trying to think of the framing the

(5:24:04) condition is you can have the perfect woman but f 5 years from now you have to

(5:24:10) die for her there is no woman of any value in the world that is worth dying

(5:24:16) for airgo I would just not blanketly die for any woman or even the perfect woman

(5:24:23) the reality is I'm not going to get the most idealistic

(5:24:28) woman even if I could I Wouldn't Die for her but I'm certainly not dying for the like M the girl that uh is like great

(5:24:37) and everything but is she a supermodel is she a virgin is like every single

(5:24:42) like trait and characteristic I would want in the woman wouldn't even die for her the perfect

(5:24:48) woman would you push push a woman out of the way of a car I mean would you like we talk about walking on the outside

(5:24:54) yeah yeah I mean there's little things like that inside of the street or like the closer to the street I so you're pretty consistent everything okay but

() 

(5:25:02) you putting yourself into the position of so I have one for you so somebody else's kid is is

(5:25:09) drowning yeah you going in wait what you what is the outcome in

(5:25:14) a Whirlpool well you don't know is this outcome is you could die and you may not he's like he's like five oh easy yeah I

(5:25:22) I'll do it so you do it for a strer but hold on well hold on but not a woman you're like St by

(5:25:28) [ __ ] don't say I'm confident enough in my rescuing ability a five-year-old I'm

(5:25:35) good I I used to Surf I know how to swim but like if it was an adult and here's

(5:25:40) the thing you probably know this with drowning if they'll P you they'll pull you down so like with a kid I think I'd

(5:25:48) be okay an adult they can die did you say you would or you wouldn't take a bullet for your

(5:25:54) child no he said he would for his I would for a boy for the kid not a girl not for a little girl I'll do it for

(5:26:00) both okay I was going ask why yes okay although couldn't I just forward the same argument like I can have more kids

(5:26:08) you know I know that sounds terrible but you do need additional WBS additional WS

(5:26:16) unless if I didn't save the kid I would lose the the the wife possibly yes so

(5:26:22) that's okay all right I mean [ __ ] I got to do a little more work but a little more it's okay

(5:26:29) just some stuff and some things yeah if I was coming from the man's perspective he's the one providing too so I would

(5:26:35) sacrifice myself because my man's the one providing f for our family as well so that's another reason why i' take the

(5:26:42) bullet but men are supposed to be protectors so women are supposed to be virgins but I feel like this doesn't

(5:26:48) work on you because you're a virgin doesn't work on me and I so she is a virgin but I mean uh yeah men are

(5:26:54) supposed to be protectors but uh to what

(5:27:00) degree like for example let's say you were dating a guy would you want your man to protect another like non-familial

(5:27:08) Stranger in a situation where it's like whoa this is like really unjust they're being like uh they're being robbed would

(5:27:16) you want your man and let's say you have kids to step in and intervene at risk of

(5:27:21) life and limb to him knowing you have children to take care of and you love your husband no no I I think his job is

(5:27:28) to protect me and our family sure so that [ __ ] can burn she burn death if there was a

(5:27:34) situation where say that woman was by herself and and he had the opportunity to protect

(5:27:40) her as a a good civilian then I would I would agree I mean I would hope that he

(5:27:46) would survive it but I would think it's Noble for him to help yeah right but ultimately Andrew

(5:27:54) Tate donated $200 don't talk about my Romanian 304s

(5:27:59) like that this situation wouldn't even come up because my women would be in the kitchen Sigma male gind Sigma male grind

(5:28:09) Set uh and that is actually Andrew Tate who just sent that in I can see it on my

(5:28:14) dashboard here it it's uh actually Andrew Tate hotmail.com who sent that in

(5:28:20) so thank you man um and then Spyro speo Brian would not die for the perfect woman but the perfect burrito

(5:28:28) though it might it'd be very tempting very tempting [Laughter]

(5:28:35) um uh that's really funny well back so but here's the thing let's

(5:28:41) say we equalized it like we gave you a crystal ball and the crystal ball you see that if your man came in right and

(5:28:50) did save this woman from catastrophe that event would kill him right would

(5:28:55) you tell him I let that [ __ ] die I would not say it like that but I would say uh I would prefer him not to

(5:29:02) intervene because ultimately I need him to be the provider and the protector of

(5:29:07) me and our true I I agree with that but women in marriage women in marriage all

(5:29:13) of our Financial Freedom we we don't get disability um if we don't have

(5:32:30) boom all right uh I'm going to get the uh roast thing going here gentlemen and

(5:32:36) ladies uh let's see um Andrew do you have a quick question

() 

(5:32:42) for them while I uh get everything sorted over here um I believe in you well thank you

(5:32:49) Brian I appreciate that um let's see what were what we covered a lot of

(5:32:55) things uh tonight so let's talk about um oh yeah yeah for you so we were we were

(5:33:01) discussing uh marriage right so I'm I'm actually not clear on what you said so we were talking about

(5:33:08) um the fact that you're Christian right but you're not saying you're going to wait till marriage necessarily that's

(5:33:14) not actually what you're saying right I actually yeah you're right I didn't say it in exact words I said I would love

(5:33:21) for that to be the case but I'm scared to say that to a man because I'm worried that they're not going to pursue

(5:33:26) anything with me because they will not be willing to yeah yeah that's what I was after right I I should have had my

(5:33:32) notepad and Wroten that down so anyway isn't that catfishing and sense well so because

(5:33:40) you're kind of you're you actually do in fact want to wait until you're married right mhm but you are in fact not

(5:33:47) telling them that because you want to attract them in and you're afraid that that's going to scare them off um not

(5:33:54) necessarily cuz when I have that initial conversation with them like I said like very soon I mean like in a matter of a

(5:34:00) day or two of talking to them like I'll make that very apparent I'm not in it for yeah but it already brought him in that's what the catfish is right the

(5:34:06) idea of the catfish is I bring you in under false pretenses in the hopes that you'll like me even though it's under

(5:34:12) false pretenses right that's the that's what catfishing actually actually is I mean I never looked at it that way I

(5:34:20) think it's more sad of the fact that I feel like I can't express to men that that's what I want because I know that

(5:34:26) it's it's I haven't found it out there I've yet to find a man who has even one

(5:34:31) mentioned that to me but to I just don't even think that it's still a thing I don't I don't even think

(5:34:37) it's still a thing that people will wait till marriage that people will genuinely fall in love with you for who you are internally as much as you as they love

(5:34:43) you externally I don't believe it and so that's why we talk about my standards I feel like that's too high for me to even

(5:34:49) want for myself who who wouldn't want to be in a relationship with a guy strictly

(5:34:55) from the fact that y'all are genuinely in love with each other for who y'all are and have that connection be in love

(5:35:02) and have have that intimacy with each other on the night that y'all get married I I would love that I would love

(5:35:07) that fairy tale but that fairy tale is too good to be true that's what I believe I genuinely believe that it is

(5:35:13) too good to be true so I just kind of throw it out and you know recently I started talking to a guy um I just

(5:35:19) recently ended it because he canceled after two are go no no you're good um he

(5:35:26) canceled on two days and I was like okay like I don't deserve that like you set him up but I remember strictly telling

(5:35:31) him I'm like it is going to be a long time till we even get to that point in the back of my head more than ever I

(5:35:37) wish I said like I wanted to be the person that I'm going to be with for the rest of my life before we even get together but I get scar he was

(5:35:44) definitely a more intimate person and it just that's not what I want that's I

(5:35:50) don't want that I would go until I get married Lord knows when it's going to happen I would go forever

(5:35:56) to have that connection with someone knowing that I'm going to be with the right person but I just don't even believe that it can happen so I do agree

(5:36:01) with you maybe it is catfishing but like I just in the back of my head I don't even think that it's possible I do not believe that there's a guy out there who

(5:36:08) will wait that long that fits the criteria that I have the bare minimum that I have well how long are you

(5:36:13) wanting to wait I don't I don't want to wait till I'm 40 50 to get married well

(5:36:19) how long do you want to wait I don't I mean there's no timeline

(5:36:26) I guess you could say I mean I don't want to wait that long like and the old I get I guess I'm asking when would you

(5:36:31) want would you get married in your 20s next year um I mean best case scenario

(5:36:36) i' get married in two years but I mean not planning for that I mean if I find someone and I'm not that person that's going to get married after a couple

(5:36:42) months you know I want to make sure that he's the one that's how you truly find out you know all their flaws and you

(5:36:48) accept them for who they are and all that stuff like it's going to take time but if it h i mean I'm not openly

(5:36:53) searching for a relationship if it happens it happens and that's why I'm allowing myself to go out on dates and

(5:36:58) open up to men like that because I'll never know if there's something there whether I'm attracted to them or not I'm still giving them a chance is

(5:37:04) Christianity a requirement for your dating yes what does have to be a specific denomination but I feel like a

(5:37:10) relationship is based around God and I 100% like I want someone who can go to church with me and truly listen to his word and not be a man how I said it's so

(5:37:17) hard men can be Christians all they want to but they don't follow they don't even try and practice it's okay to be sinful

(5:37:22) we are all sinful people but they don't try to change they don't try to fix their imperfections they don't try and

(5:37:28) do anything about it they they're still going to keep committing the sexual sins that they've been committing since day

(5:37:33) one like that's my problem with even finding a Christian man is because they're they don't try and abide by

(5:37:40) anything me Christianity has become a a cultural identifier it doesn't mean that

(5:37:45) you rigorously practice the religion yeah right that's just the case right so I guess I'm just curious so you do put

(5:37:52) that out there other than I want to wait till marriage in the hopes that you go on a date and he really likes you and

(5:37:58) then you can Spill the Beans there and you hope he sticks around right yeah but don't you think that if he came in and

(5:38:04) then he told him that on the date that he would feel like he got

(5:38:09) catfished no because I don't I mean I'm not going to like the first time I'm

(5:38:14) texting someone I'm going to be like hey I'm not looking for hookups but I'm actually very well where are you texting him at like dating profiles and [ __ ] uh

(5:38:22) both I mean there was one guy I talked to for maybe a a week and actually I think the first day I met him I

(5:38:27) literally told him like I opened myself up not as a looking for a relationship with him but I you know we just ended up

(5:38:33) getting a conversation I was very open about it we have to move on but uh I'm going to get through into the

(5:38:39) questionnaire Andrea you said that a man you disagree a man dating a transgender woman is not straight you disagree why

(5:38:45) is that wait I I I disagree that into the mic please SC in wait sorry I

(5:38:50) misunderstood it then that a manand dating a transgender woman is not straight so no here's the statement that

(5:38:58) you disagree with a manand dating a transgender woman is not straight you

(5:39:04) disagree with that so you think it's straight for a man to date a transgender

(5:39:11) woman I I would say so because they're transgender like they they got surgery

(5:39:17) and everything yeah say sure they they are straight then cuz like they have you

(5:39:25) know they went to get they had surgery to get a vagina that's not a vagina that

(5:39:31) is not a have you seen a vagina like let's there's there's two there's two gay dudes and one is in a terrible

(5:39:39) accident where it smashes his genitals and like leaves some kind of wound there

(5:39:44) it's his partner like goes through with that is he then straight wait his

(5:39:50) partner um oh if that happened um I don't know

(5:39:57) maybe they wouldn't like that they would want yeah maybe they wouldn't but if they did would that be straight of them

(5:40:02) to do well I mean he didn't want to be transgender so I I mean that's still

(5:40:08) they're still gay because he didn't okay so he didn't transition right so then this the the sexual identity is just

(5:40:14) based on or the the idea of straight or gay is just based on what you feel like

(5:40:19) not the biological act but they are taking like um medication you know like

() 

(5:40:25) estrogen and stuff yeah you know to look like to appear as a woman as well yeah

(5:40:30) but they're but they're not in fact a woman right but if they have the surgery you know then they're still just men

(5:40:36) who've cut off their penises right but it's turned into like they have to um use like the dilators you know to what

(5:40:44) if they did it on their vagina what if they did it what on their arm like they just they made the Neo vagina on their

(5:40:50) arm instead of where they're like where their genitals were and that's what you use like why would it why is the

(5:40:57) position of where the vagina is the important part wait they don't do that though that's but if they did well

(5:41:02) that's this is a completely different question um I don't see how it's different like what you're saying I'll

(5:41:08) explain cuz here's what you're saying to me you're like if the if a dude cuts off his penis and then dresses like a woman

(5:41:14) and then takes hormones to have the um appearance to everybody of being woman

(5:41:20) hang on of being a woman right uhuh then why would it matter if their vagina was on their arm instead of like in this

(5:41:26) region why is it a region important why is that specifically important I don't

(5:41:31) get it what it's like that doesn't make any sense why doesn't it make sense it would be more useful cuz you could put

(5:41:37) you can put a wound that you have to dilate any place on the body you don't have to put it there they're us they're

(5:41:42) dilating their vagina to you know like stretch it to well they're dilating an open wound um it's literally an open

(5:41:49) wound that's what it is it's not an open wound cuz it'll heal doesn't heal close

(5:41:54) it in fact that's why they're dilating it so it never heals it's like gauges in the ear have you ever seen people who

(5:42:00) have giant holes in their ear yeah they're dilating them why so that they don't so that they

(5:42:06) don't I've seen them when they take it out it's like just there already they don't close after no after a while you

(5:42:13) can stretch them out so wide they don't ever close up well yeah you have to stretch it oh I don't know well it's the

(5:42:18) same thing with that it's the same exact concept do they have to dilate it I don't know if they have to dilate them

(5:42:23) for the rest of their lives some of them do yeah some yeah how I didn't know that

(5:42:29) it's your body's trying to heal so it's trying to close them I don't think it's often but I pretty sure would I wouldn't

(5:42:37) consider them you well if uh I wouldn't consider them like a guy gay still if he

(5:42:44) went if he was with a transgender woman I wouldn't consider him gay I would

(5:42:50) consider him straight okay do they need to have the bottom

(5:42:55) surgery um or can a guy go home and suck his girlfriend's dick and he's straight I honestly like do I was

(5:43:02) thinking about that too like if he still had his genitals but you know literally look like was a was still a woman but

(5:43:10) they still have their genitals I honestly like I don't know like I don't know maybe if they do acts

(5:43:18) you know like where he's like sucking her dick or something does that even

(5:43:24) sound correct he's sucking her like that does that even sound right or doesn't that

(5:43:31) sound a little bit like oh there's a another group of guys who do that called

(5:43:36) G honestly like to me I'm not I'm not a person to be like oh my God you have a

(5:43:43) dick like you're you're a male like if a guy wants to transition he dresses like

(5:43:48) a girl looks like well they look like a girl dressed like a girl but they have like male genitals like I'll still call

(5:43:56) them you know she if they want to be called she her I'll still call them that like it it doesn't bug me I get that you

(5:44:02) will use the pronouns that they want cuz you don't want to be rude right um yeah I just does that mean in your brain

(5:44:08) though you actually think in fact that this is a man um or this is a woman no

(5:44:14) because they don't they don't appear as a man so I wouldn't consider what about the ones who are really trying to appear

(5:44:19) as the thing uhhuh but you can tell um well that's probably because

(5:44:25) they took their medicine like way too late in life sure um is that still a girl honestly if

(5:44:32) they're dressing up like a girl and they like really want to be a girl like I'll say they're a girl so then your position

(5:44:38) basically is this uhhuh that if a dude puts on a wig and has a beard right and

(5:44:45) then has sex with another dude who puts on a wig and has a beard they're not gay

(5:44:51) well well I don't know are they like like they definitely want they

(5:44:57) definitely want to be women they definitely want to be women they want to be one they definitely want to but they

(5:45:03) in fact are not they definitely do want to though mhm but like like they still

(5:45:09) are growing out well I mean I guess well they can't help it they can't they want to not but they can't help but grow the

(5:45:15) beard like they can't help it they want to not like just there's some women out there same thing they don't want facial

(5:45:22) hair but they can't like they can only do so much about it yeah you see women with facial hair too so you you would

(5:45:28) consider them you're not going to be like you're a man cuz you have facial hair uh no I would just be like uh well if you have a penis you're a man because

(5:45:35) I'm not insane but when I'm looking at the idea from you you're basically just

(5:45:40) telling me that if two guys put on wigs and had beards and went at it that's not gay

(5:45:48) because they both want to be women and that's a super weird position

(5:45:54) to me cuz then couldn't she switch it up like they could be doing that and then go oh you know what I don't feel like a

(5:45:59) woman anymore and then it's back to being gay get like I don't I don't even get that it's never made any sense to me

(5:46:07) I guess before we let the RO come in um do you think it's do you think it's acceptable for a man to refuse to date a

(5:46:12) transgender person because they are trans which you you said you disagree

(5:46:18) with that you think it's not acceptable wait okay so a man I here's the here

(5:46:23) I'll make it super simple I would not want to date a trans person okay is that wrong do I age that um that's your

(5:46:30) preference is it wrong though um I can't I can't say if it's wrong or right it's

(5:46:35) literally your preference like it's okay um there's literally no right or wrong

(5:46:41) to a preference what if okay what if it's the

(5:46:47) case that Brian wanted to date trans people but didn't because he thinks it's

(5:46:55) because he just thinks it's gross anyway he kind of wants to but he doesn't right

(5:47:01) and he has like let's say it's religion he's like nope I'm going to appeal to my religion and that's his preference is

(5:47:07) that wrong honestly like

(5:47:13) um this is getting Brian back for the [ __ ] Pineapple Pizza second I don't

(5:47:18) know I can't I literally can't tell you if it's like right or wrong because it's just a preference okay that's consistent

(5:47:25) like yeah so if you don't want to you don't have to but like uh I don't know if what I what I think like I don't know

(5:47:32) if you're attracted to that person like just go for it you know sure um here I'm

(5:47:37) going to blast through some of the other things here Andrea but if you don't one followup very quickly but what if a

(5:47:44) transperson went to Brian and said I'd like to date you and Brian went as is

(5:47:49) his preference to go oh God gross yuck is that okay too no that reaction is not

(5:47:56) okay well then I guess it's not that re the reaction is not okay all right uh

(5:48:02) men so here's the statement men are not insecure for caring about a woman's body count do you agree or disagree you

(5:48:09) should probably scoot into the table so we they are not insecure okay so it's fine for men to care about the one's

(5:48:14) body count yeah men are insecure about men are insecure okay what about you is it fine for a man to care about body

() 

(5:48:21) count are they insecure if they do oh no you you said wait oh it's so hard um so

(5:48:28) the statement men are not insecure for caring about the woman's body count you disagree with that so that would imply

(5:48:34) that men are insecure for caring about the woman's body count what do you mean like like just curious or like they G they gonna be like

(5:48:40) they're going to make judgments about you based on the body the girl has a body count of 10 he doesn't want to dat her because of Ro counts 10 oh I do

(5:48:47) think he's insecure okay what about you it is not insecure what about you not insecure okay so going around the table

(5:48:53) I'm just going to just real quick going to point out that the likelihood that the two women here with the low pop

(5:49:00) probably the lowest body count are the ones who think that it's not insecure I'm just going to point that out just

(5:49:06) going to point that out what's your body count I'm not saying that I can't say didn't you say

(5:49:12) it last time I said I'm not going to disclose that that's too personal oh but body

(5:49:17) count okay it doesn't matter uh what's your body count Jen what's your body count lower than most of people on the

(5:49:23) show but I'm not going to give a number do you want to do a range like 5 to 10 10 to

(5:49:28) 20 10 and 20 okay range no I can't do that I can't do that this is too public

(5:49:34) range 5 to 10 zero one um no but I have seen men where they

(5:49:43) say oh my God if a girl has four bodies that's too much but they have like 30 bodies it's like what why do you care

(5:49:49) she has four bodies and then uh Andrea you said that women uh so here's the statement women have equal rights to men

(5:49:56) in the USA to which you disagree so you think women don't have equal rights to

(5:50:03) men you women don't have equal rights no because men get paid more than we do so

(5:50:12) wait so you agree that women don't have equal rights oh well yeah rights but

(5:50:18) like oh I was I was thinking of like other things women I mean men are treated a little bit better than women

(5:50:24) in the US but okay so women have equal rights to men in the USA you disagree uh what rights do men have that women

(5:50:32) don't oh I I I misunderstood that question no I think you unod it um well

(5:50:39) what I was just what I was thinking when I read that was just like you know the pay the wage there's a difference

(5:50:46) between us okay are women oppressed in the United [Music]

(5:50:55) States I don't know a little bit I don't know just like I don't know things like maternity

(5:51:01) leave and stuff like a lot of a lot of jobs W higher like pregnant women you know because they're going to

(5:51:07) be on maternity leave they don't want to pay a woman who's going to leave and it's just like you know things like that

(5:51:14) well that's illegal and they could sue for that I think I I saw something like Trump was going to start making that

(5:51:21) legal again mhm okay um here I'm going to let a couple of roast come through uh

(5:51:27) guys $30 roast $30 $0 Brian wants to be able to step up and defend a woman in

() 

(6:02:15) them all together it can affect how easily you get drunk do are you

(6:02:21) recommended against drinking yeah which is why I don't do it in most cases but even my doctors are like if you do it

(6:02:28) every now and every now and then and you don't overp partake in that it's fine but if you make like a a habit of it

(6:02:35) then it's pretty harmful to your body so when's the last time you drank besides

(6:02:43) tonight like two months ago playing D and D with my family

(6:02:48) yes are any of your the medicines you take are they psychoactive

(6:03:00) when you drink yeah I'm sure I don't know I don't know the specific contraindication

(6:03:06) the medic I don't know what the medications you are are taking I don't know the Contra indications are

(6:03:12) [Music] um but to be fair you like you maybe had

(6:03:18) like this much total yeah that's a lot and that's what I'm saying is when you add my medications which several of the

(6:03:26) bottles you know it shows that you are more inclined to get buzz on them then yeah I I definitely get buzzed really

(6:03:32) easily Michael Jones donated $30 we can't waste our time none of these

(6:03:38) women would bow for their man nice to see show in the room debating delusional

(6:03:44) women a true master of speechcraft uh let's play the bow video

(6:03:50) Let's play the bow video so this is a video I took my ex-girlfriend uh and this is kind of the expectation I have for all my future

(6:03:56) relationships can you scoot the microphone the edge of the table please for the dozenth

(6:04:02) time you yeah I know it's it's hard to follow in instructions you've been alive for 38 years or whatever 37 you just

(6:04:11) can't follow instructions um it's not that hard guys damn bro not making that

(6:04:17) much of a difference just saying yeah okay hold on hold on hold on it's not making that much of a

(6:04:22) difference rules are in place whether you like them or not why don't you just

(6:04:27) follow the rules follow not on purpose I don't think I should be called out for something that's not making a difference

(6:04:34) well hold on I'm getting like I move around a lot and like yeah yeah but we told you not to move the microphones to

(6:04:41) I don't it's don't care whether you're automatic movement I'm It's s i ha people I I it really bothers me when

(6:04:47) people say I didn't intend to do something that bothers you annoys you or

(6:04:53) hurts you in some way that that's frustrating to me I've always apologized yeah but just fix it I don't want to

(6:04:59) like these girls you date that constantly do like stupid [ __ ] and then

(6:05:04) while I said sorry how about you just stop doing the thing that's annoying well as someone who claims they might be

(6:05:10) autistic sometimes people have automatic motions that they're not aware of correct I I am neurot I'm not

(6:05:18) neurotypical I have automatic things that I do that I'm not aware of socially and movements I I like move around a lot

(6:05:25) it's it's pretty like but you're able to move it back is the thing so why not like if you are yeah but I'm just I'm

(6:05:31) not aware of it cuz I'm like this is I TW like I move this is just how I am am

(6:05:36) it's not I I've apologized every time you have agency and control over

(6:05:42) yourself like if I told you I've apologized I don't mean to I I'll try to work on it but I've also I told you it's

(6:05:48) the end of the show it's the end of the show what is there to work on you I've had to tell you to move your microphone

(6:05:53) like a dozen times I never noticed I moved it I'm I'm buzzed I I just never

(6:05:59) noticed I Did It On the Alcohol okay but it's true I wouldn't do it on purpose I

(6:06:04) it's just automatic things that I don't like I'm been moving my my leg this entire time no yeah I I said I'm sorry I

(6:06:13) I took accountability I I I was wrong I'm not saying I didn't do something wrong love to handwave away ways in

(6:06:21) which they're wrong by saying I didn't mean to how often is it the case that

(6:06:27) like how often is it the case that somebody's intention is just in completely irrelevant I don't care what

(6:06:35) your intention is or is not true I I've apologized every single time and I gave you the reason that I have not been

(6:06:41) aware I'm first time being on air and have all these uh nervous movements

(6:06:48) because like this is something I'm new to so I'm not always worried about what I'm doing I'm worried about like this is

(6:06:55) new it's it's anxious like it's I like yeah I I'm wrong I'm I'm going to try

(6:07:01) not to do it it's the end of the show but I'll try to focus on my mic and not the conversation for now on there we go

(6:07:08) but it's I I I don't understand it's so simple we we instruct just leave the microphone where it is that's it we just

(6:07:15) say hey don't move the microphone leave it where it's at I realize I realize it seems crazy I just haven't realized I

(6:07:22) did it but do you do this in relationships where like a uh the person you're dating says hey I don't like it

(6:07:28) when you do this whether it's minor or major and then you continue to do it and

(6:07:33) then all of a sudden something that's very minor you're like it's not just you did something bad or you did something

(6:07:39) wrong it now becomes now you're crossing a specific boundary that I laid out of like hey please don't do this oh I'm

(6:07:47) sorry I didn't intend to let me let me repeat this mistake that bothers you dozens and dozens of times no I I don't

(6:07:54) do that this I've never been live in this situation and I think it makes me

(6:08:00) more anxious and more like more a not aware of my

(6:08:06) movements all right that's it that's it yeah it's moving a mic I I'm I'm

(6:08:11) twitching and stuff CU it's an it's an anxiety thing um I've never done this on

(6:08:18) live you know podcast so all right it's kind of a [ __ ] babysitter

(6:08:26) um babysitting because of a mic okay I've been babysitting multiple people on the panel it's not just you it was that

(6:08:32) girl who [ __ ] did a rage quit it was Kenzie who was being being obnoxious I've been babysitting all night and it's

(6:08:38) [ __ ] frustrating um women have equal rights to men in the USA you disagree why is

(6:08:43) that it's not that serious uh my only um argument is men being a little be being

(6:08:52) able to go on the beach topless and not men but women can have like this part of

(6:08:57) their breast out but not the nipple is there anything besides that oh not really those are by the way those are

(6:09:04) local ordinances so well I mean it's not it's usually State yeah local but it

(6:09:10) it's like local IAL say Federal First a state I live in Texas well okay so if

(6:09:16) you're talking about State states rights then there's all sorts of states rights then that I can appeal to like uh okay

(6:09:23) men can be called into militia service and women can't at the state level and equal and there States where there's

(6:09:29) abortion which is available to women uh while there's a militia call right so

(6:09:34) well you they asked the question and that was my answer of the the titties Fe the titties that's it sure um you the

(6:09:42) statement as is as follows women are not oppressed in the USA you disagree why is that titties same

(6:09:48) thing and I'd say abortion laws are kind of crazy in Texas I would say so I mean

(6:09:54) women not being able to be bare breasted well they call it a sex organ um that a

() 

(6:10:01) pression I don't know if that's a I think it is because it's social uh stigma um it's not based off of women

(6:10:07) can go topless in many beaches what do you mean well I mean not in the United States it's not a federal thing it's

(6:10:12) like a um is there anything else besides the okay so that's it and then well you

(6:10:17) were going to say abortion right yeah it's in Texas is a little crazy so just

(6:10:23) so you know there's there's many many states where men can't go topless either oh where yeah where where where well

(6:10:30) they're they're local ordinances so it's not the state itself is not restricting from the local ordinance of saying you

(6:10:36) can't have a shirtt in or you you know you can't take your shirt off in this area but there's tons and tons of places in the United States where men are

(6:10:42) restricted from taking their shirts off in like beaches or like just public places like other I I don't know

(6:10:49) specifically uh going to Sarah Sarah you the statement is as follows possible to

(6:10:54) be racist towards white people you disagree why is that I would say because racism is

(6:11:01) systemic and so I do believe you can be prejudiced towards white people or other people who have not had the systemic

(6:11:09) racism um but I believe using that specific word implies a systemic issue

(6:11:16) well so you define racism as what I mean it is it is Prejudice for sure but how

(6:11:22) do you define racism um racism is a um it's a systemic oppression of a

(6:11:31) certain um ethnicity of people throughout history

(6:11:36) I think that's probably have you heard this one racism equals Prejudice plus power I have heard that before is that

(6:11:42) what you adhere to that definition of racism I think so yeah okay so like a black person could not be racist towards

(6:11:49) a white person I think they can be Prejudice but not racist I would well I

(6:11:54) guess I if you use that definition then possibly but I was still looking at it

(6:12:00) from the systemic issue of it of slavery and all of that I see by that definition

(6:12:07) you could be racist towards Indian people Native Americans Yeah by that definition and

(6:12:13) you would agree with that can you scoot your mic that way this way to your right I

(6:12:19) guess you would agree with that that like blacks could be uh racist towards naan

(6:12:25) Americans by that that's a hard question I haven't

(6:12:32) thought about that I haven't thought about that I know that there I know that

(6:12:37) Indians or Native Americans have H have been oppressed um systemically

(6:12:44) systemically I don't think it was black people who were oppressing them

(6:12:50) systemically well I mean I don't oppress black people you right I I'm not calling

(6:12:56) right so there's systems that do that right yes yeah so as long as black people have been part of the

(6:13:03) participating system than they have been participating in the system of Oppression towards Native Americans

(6:13:09) right who have their own Sovereign land Sovereign

(6:13:14) everything perhaps I I that one's something I would have to do a little bit more research on to really have a

(6:13:21) good solid opinion can Asians be racist towards black

(6:13:26) people I believe so can black people be racist towards Asians I believe that I

(6:13:33) believe they can be pre towards them okay what about Hispanics I think Prejudice okay so the only group

(6:13:41) that you can think of that blacks could be racist towards would be Native Americans because of the systemic

(6:13:47) oppression towards that single group well like I said I would have to just do a little bit more research to have a

(6:13:52) better opinion on that not saying they are I'm just asking if that's in the realm of possibility possibly okay so

(6:13:59) but that's the only group possibly that that's even equatable to

(6:14:07) possibly okay uh and then you also on this you think it's uh you disagree that

(6:14:12) it's possible to be racist towards white people um I

(6:14:18) disagree yeah coming from into the mic please oh coming from a perspective of a

(6:14:25) person who has had to deal with racism my entire life the way that they deal with it compared

(6:14:31) to with it as in racism it's more of a joking matter or a retaliation rather than to

(6:14:40) people going out of their way to be racist towards black people rather than white people are usually called those

(6:14:45) slurs in retaliation to them being racist MH okay

(6:14:51) uh conceivably though could there be a scenario where a black person could be racist towards a white

(6:14:58) person Prejudice here I'll give my example that I tend to give on this one then we're going to move it on to the

(6:15:03) next thing uh let's see here um how do I guess how do I want to frame

(6:15:10) this um okay Barack Obama he refuses to hire a white janitor

(6:15:17) because the janitor is white is that racism I think that's a prejudice

(6:15:22) against white people but is there has that happened

(6:15:28) systemically or I mean it could it could be on that smaller scale or it could be like some like let's say he passed uh

(6:15:34) like he did an executive order saying uh white people have uh white people have

(6:15:42) uh less of a vote than black people is there a so their vote is worth like two-thirds that of a black person's

(6:15:49) vote is there a history of of white people um of black people enslaving

(6:15:58) white people because I believe that would make it racism not in the United States but in other regions of the world

(6:16:06) yes I don't know about those other regions of the world but since we are talking about I mean there's what that

(6:16:12) was that wasn't black people no but I'm saying white people were enslaved yes yeah I didn't mean black yeah more

(6:16:19) precise yeah I was asking if if white if black people ever enslaved white people systemically and that isn't the case and

(6:16:25) so but I'm I'm I'm confused here because if racism equals Prejudice plus power so

(6:16:31) Barack Obama the president United States the most powerful country in the world the

(6:16:37) he has systemic power over the executive branch of the government which is a system so systemically this would meet

(6:16:45) like that would meet your definition of racism Prejudice plus power equals racism he has power unless is your

(6:16:52) assertion that Barack Obama when he was president didn't have power no I believe he did have power but I also did perhaps

(6:16:59) the most powerful person in the world and then he did something that was Prejudice you would have to concede that

(6:17:05) that would be racist then so I actually didn't give that definition but if that was the definition of racism then I

(6:17:11) would have to concede and say yes okay so you're saying there has to be a historical component of systemic black

(6:17:20) Prejudice towards white people I systemic level so it has to be

(6:17:26) historical too I I believe like if we're going to use the word racism then I do

(6:17:32) believe so but I do believe you can have a prejudice towards people of A different race of a different culture of

(6:17:38) you know disabilities I do believe you can be prejudiced yeah I just reject her definition even granting this super

(6:17:46) charitable one of racism equals Prejudice plus power I'm in the example I provided it meets that now you want to

(6:17:53) like throw on oh but there has to be a historical component

(6:17:58) too so what I mean do you believe that I mean that the same

(6:18:05) um oppression that black people have had throughout history is the same of the same as that that scenario that you just

(6:18:13) gave where Obama didn't hire the janitor because he was white oh I didn't say

(6:18:18) that at all I also don't think it's a rational definition I understand what you're saying to Steelman it it's just

(6:18:24) that the there's been systemic meaning the powers at be government P Powers

(6:18:30) government forces have historically oppressed black people there's no no doubt that that is the case um leading

(6:18:37) into modernity and because that history is there plus the systemic oppression

(6:18:42) plus systemic oppression now right racism has to be geared towards the

(6:18:49) system towards a specific group right so do you not believe that the word racism

(6:18:56) is systemic or no no well I'm willing to Grant it I just want to make sure that I got that I'm correct about how you see

(6:19:03) it I'm I'm I'm trying to follow yeah so the system oppresses right and historically the

(6:19:10) system has oppressed and those are the necessary preconditions for racism otherwise it's Prejudice I

(6:19:17) believe so okay got it so then if that's the case the individual can't do very much about systemic

(6:19:23) oppression or and the individual can't do much about being systemically oppressed like you the individual can't

(6:19:29) do very much about being systemically oppressed and I the individual can't do much about systemic system you being

(6:19:35) oppressed right correct so then I don't understand that it sounds to me like you

(6:19:40) can you can make the argument that systems can be racist but at the individual level if I can't participate

(6:19:47) in the system of Oppression nor can you participate in the system of being oppressed why is it that my Prejudice

(6:19:54) towards you or your Prejudice towards me couldn't be racist or you could only be Prejudice towards me the

(6:20:01) individual um I mean we can equally be prejudice I do believe that but I

(6:20:06) believe that I mean I do believe that semantics matter and I believe that yes

(6:20:12) and so when we use the word racism that that has a definition so but you're

(6:20:17) applying it to a system not individuals right yeah so if an individual so like

(6:20:23) if I called a black person the n-word or a black person called me the c-word right let's say two two racial

(6:20:29) categories you may not consider those equivalent insults right but you'd have to consider them both to be racial slurs

(6:20:36) right my argument to you for systemic racism would just be this the system's not doing that there's

(6:20:43) no system there which is being applied to force you to call me this nor me call you that so that's the case that I'm not

(6:20:50) a part of a system of Oppression nor are you a part of being um oppressed by me

(6:20:57) in a system how's that not you being either prejudiced towards me or or just

(6:21:03) me being prejudiced towards you in other words why why isn't just the individual if they say the n-word why are they just not Prejudice

(6:21:10) instead of racist I think we would have to ask more questions what would give you the what

(6:21:16) would what would make you feel comfortable saying that or calling a black person the N word the same thing

(6:21:21) that would make them comfortable saying the c word whatever the conditions are for that so I guess then that goes to that

(6:21:29) goes back to who I mean I obviously we can't answer this question of who started it you know I mean that sounds

(6:21:35) very childish but did we let's just say that well let's just say that they just say it on

(6:21:41) their perspective podcasts right so like let's say there's two different podcasts

(6:21:47) and they're on like some I don't know free domain or something like this and one is just like they just say the word

(6:21:53) the n-word all the time the other one says the CW all the time right one's black who says the c word all the time

(6:21:59) one is white who says the n-w all the time the white guy is not part of any system of Oppression he's not part of

(6:22:06) any governmental system which is designed to oppress anybody neither is the the black person in this scenario

(6:22:13) they're both individuals who are saying a racial slur but why is it in that case

(6:22:18) the white person would be racist and the black person would only be Prejudice that's what I don't understand if the

(6:22:25) racial terminology is applied to a system itself yeah and I do I understand what

(6:22:31) you're asking me and I do believe that perhaps um I mean I understand that some

(6:22:37) people may say certain things in ignorance and not realize how it's sounding I do believe because there is a

(6:22:43) history of of white people being racist towards black people that we would view

(6:22:51) things like you saying that word um through the lens of of racism as opposed

(6:22:57) to you just being Prejudice towards that person that black person yeah but that

(6:23:02) doesn't make any because there's no there's no system though there's nothing systemically happening at the individual

(6:23:08) level it's only systemically happening at a systems level so like University guy's in charge of a university calls

(6:23:15) person the NW he has the power of an institution right behind him or some

(6:23:20) sort of institutional power in order to do to make this actually affect you in some way I could see you then saying if

(6:23:28) I called him the CW that's Prejudice he calls me the n-word that's racist by your definition of systemic I can't

(6:23:34) understand it on the individual level with people who aren't participating in a system of Acts I understand but the

(6:23:41) thing is there's not really a way of determining whether it's racism or Prejudice by what you're just saying I

(6:23:48) think there is I would say that like I like I said before that we are going to

(6:23:53) view it through the lens of racism um because how you view it

(6:23:59) through the lens of thing is individualistic so like okay but if White people viewed it through the lens

(6:24:05) of also racism you would just reject it even though it's still an individual assessment at that point I mean if you

(6:24:12) consider it racism then you consider it racism and I can still disagree and say that it's Prejudice yeah but we're we're

(6:24:18) not really going off of me rejecting your definition but accepting it and

(6:24:24) just kind of telling you where the where where I see a logical inconsistency yeah

(6:24:29) if there is no system which ex person's participating in it's just an individual

(6:24:34) mhm and it's the same on the opposite side right so there's no oppressor oppressed relationship there between the

(6:24:41) individual I don't understand why the individual can't be racist themselves towards another

(6:24:46) individual if there's no systemic push in other words or why they couldn't be

(6:24:53) prejudiced towards another individual well because well I feel like we're quibbling here or not equiv equivocating

(6:24:59) so we know what Prejudice in this case means that means um

(6:25:04) racist absent power essentially your racist absent systemic or historic

(6:25:10) context that would be Prejudice right perhaps yeah yeah something well

(6:25:15) something like that at least like in that frame and we know that racism in this context means

(6:25:21) historic plus systemic right that equals can be racist

(6:25:26) yeah got it but if you're not part of anything which is systemic like for instance a white guy gets here from

(6:25:33) Ireland right two days from now um and he just starts like shouting the NW

(6:25:39) right he's not part of any system of anything right he just really hates black people let's say that she just

(6:25:45) hates them how how is that you would say that's racist but if a if a black man

(6:25:51) comes over from um let's say I'm some

(6:25:56) part of uh of Africa that's never had a history of slavery or a different

(6:26:02) country where uh there's a lot of black people who don't have a history of slavery or general history of slavery at

(6:26:08) least in the United States context couldn't they be racist um no I don't think so I would

(6:26:14) say no I wouldn't think so you're saying that they're spewing off like uh profanity towards whites white people I

(6:26:23) would how do they get to be a part of this system of of Oppression where they're not a part of the system and

(6:26:28) have no historic context now no I mean that's I guess that's tough I

(6:26:35) I think that that would be a learned behavior perhaps um I do think and you're

(6:26:42) probably going to disagree with me on this but I do think that a lot of if there is a black person spewing off like

(6:26:49) racial slurs towards a white person that a lot of it is in retaliation because of

(6:26:55) the systemic racism but if they just think it's

(6:27:00) funny the black person if they think it's funny to say to say slurs towards a white person they

(6:27:06) just think it's funny to do no I I think sometimes they do because I think that I think so too so a

(6:27:12) guy a guy comes in from a you know a section of Africa who's has no ties to

(6:27:18) the United States really at all comes in as a let's say immigrant or Refugee or

(6:27:23) something like this had doesn't have any history right no there's no historic

(6:27:28) context then he's not part of any system he just thinks it's funny to call white people these slurs right and he does

(6:27:35) think lowly of them right and he calls them slurs isn't he racist at least at that

(6:27:42) point I think he's prejudiced towards white people yeah so then then for me

(6:27:47) got to move it on yeah yeah I'll just wrap it here for me this is it's an inconsistent definition because if it

(6:27:53) requires power and historic context and the system and and now we can point to a

(6:28:00) person has none of those things and they still can't be the thing that's sounds like you're elevating privilege at that

(6:28:06) point that's just some kind of privilege that's applied arbitrarily it's not I don't think it's privilege I think it's

(6:28:12) sematics in definition yeah but Jason Castle donated $30 share one shut up

(6:32:38) M um I definitely women's rights thank you and I definitely feel like we were

(6:32:46) going in the wrong direction and how how so um just the way

(6:32:53) that our president talks about women and the way he feels women should have less

(6:32:58) rights and access to things when it comes to the household and all these other things what I don't know if he said what are you talking about like

(6:33:05) Trump trump Trump's too much for simp like he all he does is hire women he has women everywhere he has him his he

(6:33:12) opened up the office of Faith first thing he did was put a woman in it it's like he's not trying he put his ex-wife

(6:33:29) put make it a cemetery it has to uh it only applies to that section of it

(6:33:37) that's where I say that there's fake news I mean even just like let's Grant it right that that's F lots and lots of

(6:33:44) men regardless of and women too hate their exes that doesn't mean that they

(6:33:49) hate all women I didn't say that he hates his ex I think he used her as a

(6:33:55) crutch if that is true she said it's false so I mean never let's just assume it like I'm just going to grant that

(6:34:00) it's true even if it was true so many people hate their [ __ ] exes like who car even if it was true

(6:34:08) like and he just really hated his ex he just seems like he just doesn't like woman unless they there as an object to

(6:43:02) black man sorry to rain on your petty poor party racism is just as real as an

(6:43:08) American dollar there is a thing called Mind Warfare do you understand this just

(6:43:14) solved that problem uh

(6:43:21) wel confused who that was for exactly I think it was just in support of some of the things I was

(6:43:27) saying oh that's what I took it as confused donated 20

(6:43:34) $9.99 okay the ladies clearly understand the question yes that is the question

(6:43:41) okay so what year are we pointing to for when America was great I would like to know that

(6:43:47) answer you said for mag he was saying for those who are I don't thinker no it was what year does the

(6:43:55) panel think is being referred to to when we say make America great comma again so

(6:44:00) you don't have to be Trump or Mega well he 19 I still honestly don't I maybe I'm

(6:44:06) [ __ ] dumb as [ __ ] I still don't understand the question I mean I hear mag I think of this year I mean this was

(6:44:12) supposed to be make America great again for Trump that's the only thing I interpreted as I don't you would have to say the following what year do you think

(6:44:19) America was great but you did not he didn't say that though yeah but I think

(6:44:25) that is what he's asking I think he's asking when was America great and in what year was that to bring us back to I

(6:44:31) think that's what he's asking what year do we want to go back to or do we do we want to replicate I would say

(6:44:38) never yeah so I mean I'll answer the question for him so it's a false dichotomy So when you say make America

(6:44:44) great again you're not actually making a reference to any specific year you're just saying that there are decades there

(6:44:49) are times when America's at Great prowess you want to take all the good things from those times and make it

(6:44:55) actually a great country again you don't have to point to a specific year it's not even necessary but if I were going

(6:45:01) to I'd point to a a block of time and say you know right around uh 1900

(6:45:07) through probably 1945 to 1955 something in that era it was a much greater Nation

(6:45:13) than it is now at least as far as the culture goes as far as the people go things like that and it wasn't great for

(6:45:18) everybody for obvious reasons that's when racism was very prevalent back in slavery sure so you you said men are

(6:45:26) physically stronger did what but what did I just say about dichotomy false dichotomy which is you don't have to

(6:45:32) take everything from these specific decades and say oh well um because bad

(6:45:40) thing was also happening like for instance let's say there was a massive fire in fact there was right between those decades right there was massive

(6:45:46) fires when I say make America great again in those in those eras do you think I'm referencing like

(6:45:52) fires I don't think you're referencing fires or any kind of right I'm not

(6:45:57) referencing yeah I'm not referencing fires I'm not referencing horrible things that could have happened with I'm

(6:46:03) trying to take the good things that came out of those arrows I think maybe to clarify what parts of those years what

(6:46:09) what were the good parts that you would want to bring back I would bring back things like patriotism I would bring

(6:46:14) back things like the nuclear family I'd bring back things like the inter interdependent Dynamics between cross-generational families

(6:46:21) cross-generational wealth Bicentennial Farms I I mean there's so much things that I would want to bring back I would

(6:46:26) also want to bring back some type of um well I don't know getting rid of the income tax that would be fantastic I'd

(6:46:32) like to do that as well like the list goes on and on and on and on but what happens is this you can't point to any

(6:46:38) great time in America where bad thing wasn't happening and so what happens is race baiters go well at that time

(6:46:44) America was racist it's like well right now according to most race biters America's racist so then you either have

(6:46:49) to say America was never great right or you or you can say there's times where it was great there's times where it was

(6:46:55) bad and I want to take the things which were great from the times it was great to use those things not everything yeah

(6:47:02) no I think for specifying I think all right Tria you said uh men are this is the statement men are physically

(6:47:07) stronger than women you disagree why is that t yeah yeah I that's how you wrote

(6:47:14) your name so that's t e a t it looks like a r okay Tia my bad

(6:47:21) okay T um uh men are physically stronger than women that was the question and I agreed

(6:47:28) with it I think you should redo this paper so people are confused no I think you guys

(6:47:34) just work on your reading comprehension I did it correctly can we get me on screen Blake can we get

(6:47:42) me um so the statement is men are physically stronger than women that's

(6:47:48) what I repeated back to you and yet you circled it indicating you disagree with that statement that men are physically

(6:47:54) you disagree with with that oh then yeah I agree

(6:47:59) sorry you put like knots to it sounds like double negative and stuff I would just redo it I mean I answered it

(6:48:05) correctly but which you still asking us it just happen it like it's happens on

(6:48:11) basically every show so well I think that's a more an indication that you guys just can't

(6:48:18) comprehend like it's not that hard I do you disagree with the statement one of

(6:48:25) them is like the first one was like do you not yeah and then disagree yeah that I mean that part's

(6:48:31) confusing for likes a person but I did answer correctly so I'm just saying since a lot of people answer wrongly and

(6:48:38) you're annoyed by it um I know I'm sometimes maybe change it for people

(6:48:45) I've look I've actually changed it I Chang it to a yes or no I've changed it to like a yes or no people still [ __ ]

(6:48:52) up I guess I haven't yet seen if I just say how about if you agree with the statement Circle

(6:48:59) it that's an option I just I don't know I think if I just read if you disagree I

(6:49:05) would be like oh do I disagree with this statement I think the one question was

(6:49:11) like do you not disagree was pretty like what I had to I had to rewrite it I mean re read it a few times do I don't know

(6:49:18) but like for example dating is easier for women so you just think in your head hm is dating

(6:49:26) easy bro holy [ __ ] I'm I answered it

(6:49:31) correctly I'm just saying if this happens every show make it yeah change it I guess yeah okay I'll

(6:49:38) I'll change it so people who um just fail at reading comprehension can figure

(6:49:44) it out I guess um okay all right

(6:49:50) uh Sarah you're a registered nurse you said you had a guy cry and basically run

(6:49:56) away when you refuse to Second Date yes that has happened before

(6:50:03) okay what's the question you said you're conservative you don't believe in sex before marriage you're a V Virgin

(6:50:08) waiting for marriage devout Christian did you say your denomination I'm a seventh avist okay um you had an

(6:50:16) objection when we were discussing I guess your appearance here to the 1 to 10 rating scale but it seems maybe that's changed do you

(6:50:23) have objection to it or not really yeah initially I didn't want to answer the question just because I felt that it's a

(6:50:31) degrading question only intended to challenge a woman's

(6:50:36) self-perception and but I then agreed to answer the question when my I spoke with

(6:50:43) the male figures in my family and they said answer the question so okay well

(6:50:50) what's you're a conservative U so seven Seventh Day Adventist are you pacifist

(6:50:55) or non-p pacifist um am I a pacifist or not a pacifist wait yeah it's a lot of Seventh

(7:00:07) next it's going to be a very boring live stream but I want you all to take it too that sounds good okay I took it I took

(7:00:13) one recently at like 5:00 a.m. on my iPad when I was tired as [ __ ] what was it it [ __ ] what was it it was

(7:00:21) uh [ __ ] I don't I think wait let let me let me if took a screenshot because uh I

(7:00:27) don't want to you know see I think it was 100

(7:00:34) 12 five that's pretty high I think pretty good wait hold on let me let me

(7:00:39) look IQ no I don't know or 12 I don't know

(7:00:48) um it's probably wrong like I'm probably like room temp but whatever uh okay so

(7:00:53) it just feels like about uh okay so you said uh this goes hand inand with some of the disagreements you're trying to

(7:00:59) understand the obsession with wanting a submissive partner it just seems like what is often described on the show is basically a robot those will be

(7:01:05) available to the masses very soon once they're affordable for everyone you really need a housekeeper figure it attend to your needs isn't there

(7:01:11) anything else men are seeking in a woman just seems pretty transactional to me I just think relationships should be a

(7:01:17) partnership You and Me Against the World type of Vibes I would rather have a partner who wants to work together on

() 

(7:01:22) things instead of assuming Traditional Values when the majority of households are two income families because of the

(7:01:28) economy I just think it isn't realistic plus it just feels like men are desperately trying to take power back

(7:01:34) now that women are well man whatever de are succeeding and don't

(7:01:39) depend on a I used a tech predictive text or the whatever voice text that's

(7:01:46) yeah because it was a lot to type I didn't type it so blame it on that sure it's fine um so the robots what about

(7:01:53) you uh oh I'm just saying I mean I mean Elon Musk is saying by 2020 was it 2030

(7:01:59) that there'll be more robots than them people yeah so but when it comes to you're trying to understand what the

(7:02:04) obsession is with wanting a submissive partner I want to quot considering what the future is uh coming up that it might

(7:02:11) not be that necessary in the future is where I'm coming from I see I see what you're saying I actually want to play a

(7:02:17) video from uh Andrew Tate I don't know if I'm going to actually be able to find it you know what I'm just going to say what he said this idea that oh but do do

(7:02:25) men really want like super submissive women he [ __ ] I'm I'm [ __ ] so lit I'm

(7:02:33) already uh he he says something along the lines of listen there's no such

(7:02:39) thing as too submissive you got to get that out of your head he wants the robot

(7:02:47) that's what he wants he wants the robot yes like men don't you think men want

(7:02:53) okay men have a woman who does everything that they say yeah and he's gonna be he's gonna be

(7:03:00) dissatisfied with that and instead go find some like woman who disagrees with him on everything I'm I totally put that

(7:03:08) I just mean submissive in a away where you expect them to do all of like the household chores and stuff and all of

(7:03:14) that I don't mean like actual like you know well what if what if he's fully providing and you're not

(7:03:22) working yeah I mean there's limits to that but yeah um you said also instead of learning to adapt to the new

(7:03:28) structure of society yall are trying to take women back in time when we didn't have freedom um like when he says 1950s

(7:03:36) um women didn't have freedom they real oppressed so oppressed I mean they they

(7:03:42) kind of were I mean if you wanted to have all the rights like um they had all

(7:03:47) the rights in the 1950s they have right now they didn't what rights did they not have in the 1950s credit cards you if

(7:03:53) you if you wanted to own a house you had to coow write but you have to have a co-signer you couldn't buy your own

() 

(7:04:00) house without your parents Co Co signing for you could you you you couldn't acrew any debt you couldn't AC debt also needed a

(7:04:07) co-signer if unless you're paying property look it up you can own it property but if you're paying full cash

(7:04:15) you can own it but without if you need a co-signer you need I mean if you need to

(7:04:20) finance it you need a co-signer either your husband or your men needed a co-signer to finance things financing

(7:04:26) wasn't done the same way in the 50s that it's done right now through banks it wasn't done the same way most people

(7:04:31) bought their houses in cash houses were a lot cheaper that's one and two women

(7:04:36) were not being oppressed read their literature from women of the time who aren't crazy whacked out feminists they

(7:04:43) definitely were not oppressed by their own metrics um to get rid of to get out of the households that they were in

(7:04:49) which was often um toxic they would have to marry marry

(7:04:56) into yeah get married um and then uh Mar uh divorce was often yeah it was frowned

(7:05:04) upon in society so they felt stuck in that yeah these poor these poor women who got married virgins and got taken by

(7:05:11) the way most of them were getting married virgins at the time they got taken care of most of their life right

(7:05:16) they got their husband's retirement they got his pension they got almost everything from him now is it peachy in

(7:05:22) every single relationship no but it's not peachy right now in every single relation 1950s uh 20% of women were

(7:05:28) minors when they got married so there's also that uh no that's completely not

(7:05:33) factual well I need to see the statistics on that but that's what I 20%

(7:05:38) are getting married at one yeah um below 18 was that legal to some yeah it was

(7:05:45) legal then was are they minors then yeah they were they were minors but it was legal yeah okay and 20% of women

(7:05:52) huh I mean from what I looked at I could be wrong but I I looked at multiple sources I mean there is a lot of fake

(7:05:58) news I could be wrong but um it was very prevalent that there was U minors

(7:08:06) was so I found it found to Andrew the king that lady who

(7:08:12) attacked you and was raging like a slack Jord crackhead when she was in your face

(7:08:17) and you went M A me I never laughed so hard in my hello so anyway it's I found

(7:08:24) your Source 5 to 15% but you neglected this no so here's here's what you

(7:08:30) neglected that they could get married with their parents permission at 17 and

(7:08:36) they were usually only marrying men who were within 2 to 3 years older than them that's not what I saw and not only that

(7:08:42) with parents permission you can do it right now in the United States with parents permission that's not what I saw

(7:08:47) I'd have to research if you can do it right this second with parental permission I know that I know that and I

(7:08:54) think that's gross um no that's not what I read that I could be wrong but that's not what I read well that's the source

(7:09:00) that I found I mean yeah I'm saying we both saw Somey old Maring a 19-year-old like is no

(7:09:07) sometimes it was uh like five year age Gap average but it like minors were but

(7:09:13) it's within that average yeah minor in average were they were they viewed as

(7:09:19) miners at the time because wasn't it wasn't it like the age of consent in some states today is like 16 no in many

(7:09:26) states I think it's less yeah it's 14 in yeah some states it's 14 I mean I don't know those St statistics but that's just

(7:09:33) what I read but like if it was legal like legally allowed uh like but still is yeah in

(7:09:40) some states still yeah I think that's weird but in Texas like yeah I mean 1 so 17-year-old married a 20-year-old that's

(7:09:47) not that bad no three years is not bad but um they said it was average of 5 years with the minor so I think that's a

(7:09:53) little more cringey I yeah I don't know what the details are okay we have this still not as bad as like if they were

(7:09:59) doing 40 or 30 year old I beat Andrew on the IQ test so I'm

(7:10:05) smarter I do not want to debate him even in the sliest I would actually take

(7:10:10) advice from you uh you should never take advice from people dumber than you bro except on

(7:10:16) people that they things that they're better than you at damn it now you just got me again dude just got me

(7:10:57) [ __ ] what is your uh social handle I guess um it is ashore Martin m a r t i n

(7:11:04) e c and I do want to State calling a woman beautiful or gorgeous means so much more than calling them fine so men

(7:11:11) take notes fine you said fine yes oh fine okay I see uh guys like the video $30 TTS okay let me try to blast through

(7:11:18) these and also just real quick just on the last point there again my position on it is not everything you can't look

(7:11:25) at any decade you can't look at any of these um these eras and not see other

(7:11:31) things inside of the society which are bad right I definitely would prefer that women get married 18 20 25 that's far

(7:11:38) preferable right um but that doesn't mean that there wasn't tons of other great things about these eras even if

(7:11:46) the percentages that you're talking about are correct yeah it was great for men and yeah

(7:11:52) like and all of yeah it was great for buying things or whatnot

(7:11:57) but I think that if you ask women materialistic person think if you ask most women if they wanted their

(7:12:02) lifestyle just like that I mean what we hear non-stop is yes we do that's why they're asking I want $300,000 a year

(7:12:09) why so my man can take or I want 250 or I want 190 why so I can stay home and take care of kids don't got to worry

(7:12:15) about [ __ ] he takes care of everything it's literally that same lifestyle which glorified throughout that same era yeah

(7:12:21) but you're in like like um California where people are more materialistic and

(7:12:28) stuff like that I'm from Texas like we're not like that as much there's plenty of materialism in Texas Texas's

(7:12:35) whole motto is like everything's bigger in Texas that's the whole motto right it's bigger in Texas but I mean it's

(7:12:41) cheaper in Texas too we've got the biggest Roadhouse and we've got the biggest trucks and we've got the biggest guns it's all [ __ ] materialism but we

(7:12:47) are all like it the standard of like it takes a lot less money to to have that

(7:12:53) and I mean and donated $30 hey share for

(7:12:58) my inst is at Jordan it's Royal I am 6 ft tall and fit I will take you to Tempa

(7:13:04) Edition get your best outfit ready is it a date next weekend do what Tampa

(7:13:10) Edition is a really nice place to go so I'll take a DM and we'll

(7:13:16) see all right uh sorry guys okay so let me just blast through these notes then

(7:13:22) that we have for Jen here uh you disagree or there's a lot that you disagree with like dating with large age

(7:13:28) gaps statistically those marriages more likely to fail not only that you say you want a woman that's not going to be

(7:13:33) nagging and ruining your peace but also want a young woman in most cases I don't believe young women have the emotional

(7:13:39) maturity well you say this have the emotional maturity yet in life to deal with conflict properly not only that but

(7:13:46) they also don't really know for sure what they want out of life yet they haven't did enough to even know what they're looking for in a partner this

(7:13:53) may seem to go well now but in 10 years when she's still hot and you aren't looking so good she may decide this

(7:13:58) isn't the life for her true that's there's a lot of divorces and stuff I mean I mean that's partially that but um

(7:14:06) yeah agreeable women become less agreeable once they mature and have their own viewpoints is is my so as

() 

(7:14:13) women age less agreeable yeah because uh they have this counter like you're saying

(7:14:19) young women are more likely to nag or whatever and oh no I didn't say that they're more likely well you said not only that you say you want a woman

(7:14:25) that's not going to be nagging and ruining your peace but also want a young woman in most cases you don't don't

(7:14:31) believe young women have the emotional maturity yet in life to deal with conflict deal with conflict yes conflict

(7:14:36) is when they do disagree they're more prone to like not dealing with conflict

(7:14:42) in a um a manner that's um let's say the way I'm speaking that's not screaming

(7:14:48) and cussing and stuff you when when it comes to this age Gap stuff this is something that I've kind of thought

(7:14:54) about this idea of a keeper somebody who's a keeper the reality is women who

(7:15:00) are single at 30 3540 are far less likely to be Keepers

(7:15:06) like of the available single women there's a smaller pool of Keepers than

(7:15:11) women who are at 20 I agree with that but I think I think

(7:15:17) they got kept but it's realistic but I think a keeper can turn into a like you

(7:15:23) know trash as well with HR just um having that woman over there she was 31

(7:15:32) m we have a 20 21y old woman here who she's way more

(7:15:39) agreeable than the 31-year-old who can't take accountability for anything not you

(7:15:44) she 21 or no the girl who got kicked the girl who left who was sitting there yeah she was 31 m well that girl was meant

(7:15:52) she 21 I guarantee you everying guy watching every guy watching regard put

(7:15:58) looks to the side whatever uh they're going to pick her off of Personality

(7:16:03) then this crazy girl I agree with that but just I base things a lot off of

(7:16:09) statistics and just um if you look at statistics it shows like the larger age

(7:16:15) Gap um look it up I I'm I don't what are the statistics as it pertains to young

(7:16:20) women uh like I guess being less a because you said uh not going to be

(7:16:25) nagging and ruining your peace I think older women are more likely to be nagging and ruining

(7:16:31) as they get older um if you marry someone that knows what they want and you agree on because they know what they

(7:16:38) want you agree on that um then yeah they're less likely likely to nag

(7:16:44) because you already you know who you're marrying people change so much between the age of 18 and 30 so if you marry

(7:16:51) someone um that's older then you're more prone to to agree on things if you marry

(7:16:57) someone 18 who hasn't had the life experience to know what they want later on in life when they have more

(7:17:03) experience you're more prone to they might change their mind on decisions that you you agree on my actually

(7:17:11) true yeah I mean I don't even understand what the hell you're talking about like I'm trying to follow it uh do I have to

(7:17:17) what was a question I can repeat all I'm just going to move it on just for the sake of time you said that uh you get that young wom women a lot of the times

(7:17:24) are hotter yeah wait you say young men women women yeah young women a lot of the

(7:17:29) times are hotter but you have your eggs frozen lol yeah a lot of a lot of this first

(7:17:37) stuff I was kind of baiting you to get on the show first of all but oh my God bro what I I was cuz I wanted to get on

(7:17:43) the show and try to um um say say my opinion on so you don't

(7:17:48) have your eggs frozen oh I do yeah I do so what's the bait young I mean a lot of

(7:17:54) the things I said I try to come off um more so you're a liar no not a liar so

(7:18:01) how what's the bait then I'm just confused I didn't put context on things and which is why you say you kept saying

(7:18:07) that I um kept back pelling but I just put context into things and I don't even

(7:18:12) think you had to do that I mean I'm probably like the most basic person there is you know like that's why I put oh I look like a

(7:18:19) hobo I you think that was ting to like I said that on purpose cuz I wanted to say

(7:18:25) my opinion and wait did she uh okay I said to you said hobo

(7:18:31) I look like a bimbo that was literally the first bimo no no just now you said earlier yes

(7:18:38) it was bimbo but I think just now you said hobo hobo I did not say i s my words so maybe okay again I'm

(7:18:46) dyslexic yeah can we can can we just move on from my my wording on your

(7:18:52) dyslexia I was just clarifying what you meant okay cuz I thought I heard one thing whatever it's not a big deal um

(7:18:57) you uh so you do have how many eggs have you do you have Frozen uh right now I have 10 I'm about to go back and freeze

(7:19:04) some more yeah it takes several rounds you know um just to increase your odds

(7:19:10) of having a kid in the future you want kids um it depends on the situation um I

(7:19:15) am disabled so um uh when I was younger I didn't think

(7:19:21) it was a good idea um but now that my health is getting better and my finances are getting better then I think it's

(7:19:26) more of a possibility which is why I froze my eggs so that I uh I could have

(7:19:31) the option of that using a surrogate mother um no actually with my disability

(7:19:37) which is crazy um where the autoimmune disease are actually trying to develop drugs because women a lot of times go

(7:19:44) into remission uh during that because of certain hormones so they're trying to um

(7:19:51) uh make drugs um to induce that you said you think you it's so that it helps the

(7:19:58) disorder okay you said it's more important to find a well-rounded woman who knows what she wants out of life and

(7:20:03) has wisdom you said you don't think I you you have more baggage from the bad things that have happened to you you

(7:20:09) think that you only or you think that only happens when people don't go through therapy and don't change uh

(7:20:16) their lifestyle and have boundaries I think it's made me a stronger person I think that's more powerful than anything

(7:20:21) else I'm still hot so in this Modern Age it seems pretty outdated I for my age I

(7:20:27) think I'm I look pretty good I'm chubby but um it is a bit outdated um what what

(7:20:35) was the other things uh yeah well-rounded what was the other things sorry uh you said you don't fully

(7:20:40) believe in in your views about abortion as well perhaps this pertains to Andrew

(7:20:46) you said stupid and mentally my medication yeah that's based off of my medication okay wait what um yeah um oh

(7:20:55) I I'll there's two sides I know the side that you're saying I'll just read it you said stupid and mentally ill people having kids what's making Society into

(7:21:02) the movie Idiocracy I mean that is true I don't believe in eugenic I I'm I'm saying that

(7:21:11) I that's just the way the world's going is uh people with mental disorders and

(7:21:16) stuff uh they tend to have more kids I I don't believe in Eugenics I don't agree in with abortion a lot of stances um but

(7:21:23) my people with mental disorders do not have more kids so right now I think yeah poor people and people with mental

(7:21:29) disorders poor it is true that poor well first of all being poor doesn't mean you have mental disorders I mean you are

(7:21:34) more inclined to have mental disorders if you're poorang like really poor the religious do not have as a subset more

(7:21:41) mental disorders than the non-religious they don't oh I agree and the religious I that I don't Rel stop for 5 seconds

(7:21:49) you Babble machine just stop for a second so when you're talking about the

() 

(7:21:54) religious are having more kids than any other demographic the religious the more heavily religious the more kids kids you

(7:22:00) have and by the way they tend to have the least amount of mental illness especially in comparison to progressives

(7:22:06) progressives have the most amount of mental illness and women have the most amount of mental illness by the way

(7:22:12) women oh I mean overwhelmingly so if you really wanted to attack mental illness men have undiagnosed mental illness

(7:22:19) because they don't go to that's unfalsifiable claim Great Men or I could just say men just don't have as much

(7:22:26) mental illness because you haven't diagnosed why men are four times more likely to to um un alive no they're four

(7:22:33) times more likely to be able to do it because they're better at it so what men do is they use they use boom boom sticks

(7:22:38) put it in their mouth and pull the trigger and women take [ __ ] pills they they cry for help so why are you

(7:22:43) all advocating they're just not as good at it why we're not equal and men are not doing why are you babbling still

(7:22:49) instead of getting back to the original topic get back to the original I want to get back to the topic okay what's the

(7:22:55) topic I great I'm still trying to talk still trying to talk so anyway um before

(7:23:00) you go into like psycho Babble mode again I'd like to focus on this one

(7:23:07) topic so moving backwards when you're talking about mental health if you really wanted to reduce mental health

(7:23:12) you would reduce the number of women born that's what would logically follow if you wanted to really increase mental

(7:23:18) health you would reduce the number of women born cuz women have many times the amount of mental health issues than men

(7:23:25) do yeah I mean I wouldn't agree with that I would say aggression um

(7:23:31) yeah and all of that is uh mental health issues and aggression is not a mental

(7:23:36) illness I no I think it's a it shows um emotional

(7:23:41) instability um I think it's just fine aggressiveness is fine course you would think it's fine yeah what's wrong with

(7:23:48) aggressiveness is me what about me this is me this you can't control your emotions what about being me you can't

(7:23:55) control your emotions if you're Meek does that mean you're not you're in control of your emotions yeah be meek to

(7:24:01) not get agitated and like flip out on people well so first of all aggressiveness does not mean that you're

(7:24:07) not in control of your emotions some people are just more flamboyant when they talk some people may have other reasons they talk loudly or they talk

(7:24:14) quietly I'm not talking about and by the way talking about aggression towards what do you want your let me ask you a

(7:24:19) question do you want soldiers in the military to be aggressive yeah they're trained yeah right you want them to be AG so there's

(7:24:26) they're trained for that it's so so you want mentally ill people in the military

(7:24:31) they are allowed in the military if if there there's a lot of mentally ill people but they have to take it that's

(7:24:36) not my question my question isn't a descriptor it's an a like you mean like depression do want mentally ill people

(7:24:43) in the military depends on the level do they have depression anxiety Then yes they're just super aggressive they're like schizoph super aggressive they're

(7:24:49) super aggressive they're not no okay well because they're more willing they're they could shoot someone who's

(7:24:55) innocent or something that pisses them off they usually don't though they shoot the enemies with who want them shot right that's the whole point we want

(7:25:02) aggressive soldiers to shoot the enemies of the United States and so you would just consider that oh it's a mental

(7:25:07) illness cuz it's not feminine I think that you just consider things that aren't feminine to be mental illnesses I

(7:25:13) didn't say that there a lot of mentally ill people's really funny is the most mentally ill people are the most

(7:25:18) feminine cuz they're women I'm not saying that's not true I'm just saying there's a lot of undiagnosed men with

(7:25:25) mental illness because they don't because it's looked on like it's looked at at being weak if you uh get help and

(7:25:32) I think that's one of the reasons why they're more likely to to delete themselves is because it's seen as being

(7:25:37) weak to get help for these no it's because men right when we do counseling we do counseling with each other without

(7:25:44) doing backbiting and back sniping and so for instance with women women use

(7:25:49) reputational damage and slander to attack each other don't beat the [ __ ] out of each other that's what men do men beat each other up when we're really

(7:25:56) upset with each other women tend to slander and do reputational damage to men and women that's their different

(7:26:01) hang on stop stop before you turn into a babble machine that's what they tend to do in order to um to attack people or

(7:26:09) things like this so if women have a friend group they have to be really cautious about what they say to to their

(7:26:16) friends because that becomes ammunition for slander and women intuitively know this which why they're super cautious

(7:26:22) with their friend groups and the things they say the things they don't say because that [ __ ] can be used against them later and that's the only [ __ ] that

(7:26:28) can be used against them later so men on the other hand we can be a lot more open within our friend group we can talk to

(7:26:35) each other about things without worrying too much about the knife jacking things like this at least in comparison to

(7:26:41) women right and we can be a lot more open about these things we don't need to go to some [ __ ] broad by the way uh

(7:26:49) most most psychologists most psychologists now are women I'm sure that men don't want to go talk to women

(7:26:55) about their problems uh that doesn't work out at home for most women for for most men so they talk to each other they

(7:27:02) have the counseling can I say that I think it's generalization that we would slander each other I've never known one

(7:27:08) single female even one that I didn't get along with that went routes of slander um okay do can can women beat up

(7:27:17) men usually if they don't fight back yeah

() 

(7:27:22) yeah right so not usually right no so if you want to damage a man as a woman what

(7:27:28) do you do yeah I mean it it could be slander or

(7:27:34) they could be and reputational damage but reputational damage what if it's the truth though no statistics I I for

(7:27:42) instance if Ted If Ted over here is an [ __ ] right it is true that he's an [ __ ] it's just that I can deal with

(7:27:48) it by punching Ted in the mouth right yeah women can't deal with things like that they can't be like well Tina over

(7:27:54) here a [ __ ] I'm going to punch her in the mouth they use reputational damage yeah but when a woman brings up things

(7:27:59) that happen a a man will do the same thing by slandering I I just don't see

(7:28:05) any statistics that says like one is um I think that a lot of women feel the

(7:28:11) need to yes there you can actually find polling date on this you can do it right now let me just ask the I'll just ask the other three girls do you think men

(7:28:17) or women are more likely to slander um women women right now there's there's

(7:28:24) literally like a bad baby Alabama Barker like Travis daughter slander going on right now that's I don't know what any

(7:28:31) of that is is everywhere the Kardashians involved yeah now let me ask all of you

(7:28:36) and I I'll start with you right let me ask you this question would you be more likely to tell a woman your darkest Secrets or a

(7:28:43) man I'm I personally um equally um

(7:28:50) likely to tell anyone it depends on how close I am if I'm you're equally close to both I don't have a more okay woman

(7:28:59) or man if you had to pick one cuz she'll never answer go ahead a man I would say

(7:29:05) a woman but I choose who I talk to about that stuff very Choice F well this guy

(7:29:10) who was your best friend did you confide a bunch of your darkest secrets to

(7:29:16) him I don't know no you don't know I don't know no one know if you don't know

(7:29:22) I don't know but remember I don't have a good relationship with men that's that's my only thing about so can I ask you a question if you think that women slander

(7:29:28) more than men why would you be more likely to tell your darkest secrets to women well my the person I tell my

(7:29:34) darkest secrets to is my sister so that's it's a different type of relationship but also a for some women

(7:29:40) you could just tell what the girl code is from the jump and with men you don't

(7:29:46) know if they're really trying to be your friend or they're just trying to be your friend to stay around long enough to try

(7:29:52) to pipe so it really depends which is why I don't like to tell men that type of stuff or they'll they'll use your

(7:30:00) preferences that you tell them of men or like what men have done to you to throw it back into your face when if it's a

(7:30:06) friend she's never going to do that cuz she's never going to want to be with you in a romantic way but I've never had to

(7:30:12) deal with slander before so I except from women from from I've seen it I've

(7:30:18) never had a deal with ital with it yeah thank goodness do you think that women talk [ __ ] behind your

(7:30:26) back I was like espe especially in La when it comes to exclusivity and so

(7:30:32) that's slander you just don't know about it that is true but and they're sneaky right [ __ ] sneaky sneaky sneaky um is

(7:30:41) anybody here willing to eat some octopus I'll do it if you do it I've had

(7:30:47) it before absolutely you'll eat it on stream I'll do it if ra you going do it raw octopus do I get do I get anything

(7:39:27) I pee I got to two he we're supposed to be entertaining I

(7:39:33) mean she she's a whole show

(7:39:39) so you can model for them teach you some tips model 101 right here okay everyone

(7:39:46) I will say something to you though I will say um because you said that you're stand that you would like to wait till

(7:39:53) marriage or you right you would like to Mar 100% period so I would say because

(7:40:01) you are afraid to to say that to a man because you think that that would turn him off um I wouldn't go so far to say

(7:40:09) that's catfishing but what I would say is that it's not it's going to set you up yeah to not be able to potentially

(7:40:16) get what you want and so basically you're setting yourself up for falling in that area when you want to stay pure

(7:40:24) yeah right no and I agree with you and that's one thing that I've been trying to work on recently is like especially when it comes to modesty like you know

(7:40:31) as a 21-year-old everyone wants to go out everyone wants to have fun but even doing that like I want to really hold on to my you know Purity in that sense

(7:40:38) because I'm trying to attract the man you know that I want you know but that's something that's so hard especially you being like religious and stuff like even

(7:40:45) finding men like that well also you got to think where are you looking for these men because if you're if you're going

(7:40:51) out and you're in the party phase and you're meeting men at the club those are not men that you're going that are going to have those same views that you want

(7:40:57) to have moving forward so go to church you know find a church try to meet men

(7:41:04) there go to coffee shops find a Christian app yeah those are those are

(7:41:10) options of where you can go to potentially meet a like-minded man yeah no I agree and I'm trying I'm trying to

(7:41:16) put myself out there I just like just gets hard man it get so hard but I would love like that's my whole thing like I

(7:41:23) open the package and like a little bit of octopus juice it's just not came out out of the

(7:41:30) package no but Brian is not having a good time with octopus want a man who's going to

(7:47:27) which check her kick out right now on your phone you will see you insulted her

(7:47:32) first be a man who which one insult the girl who came over here and tried to

(7:47:38) assult you no she insulted me first she came back and insulted me I didn't insult her

(7:47:47) first you you might have done a little something I think what you just I'm not going to lie to you but listen what did

(7:47:54) I do I'm not saying it wasn't she was being EST most entitled rude she was rude to

(7:48:00) me she was rude to the rest of the people she was I don't recall if she look you and me are our friends so we

(7:48:07) got each other's back so if she's [ __ ] with my [ __ ] yeah like you're part of whatever family like that's if

(7:48:13) she's insulting the podcast that's by extension you no no no she The Exchange

(7:48:19) though she got up she was arguing with you I was just sitting here she came back and was like and you blah blah blah

(7:48:25) blah blah and I was like then I started making fun of her which provoked her is that what happened

(7:48:32) which did provoke her do you want me to yeah do you want me to lie or tell no tell the truth okay so

(7:48:40) um I thought it was funny but as she was leaving you're I it it was kind of in

(7:48:46) the attitude of like good get get out of here and you kind of mocked her a little

(7:48:52) bit warranted it was warranted but I do think there was a bit

(7:48:57) of mocking no she started it a little little she started it I think the retion

(7:49:03) was worse than warranted than what he did I mean the mocking while she was

(7:49:09) there got pretty bad especially as some with that was so funny someone with

(7:49:14) disabilities it's not cool to uh you know let's doing all that like what remember you know how Trump

(7:49:21) got in trouble for walking that reporter that's I wouldn't do that you just did

(7:49:27) you you I would never we have to you know we

(7:49:33) got to be we got to be uh you know you did you did you did the thing

(7:49:43) but it was repeatedly it was warranted you know she just said that as somebody

(7:49:48) who defends the lgbtq community she she dropped the f bomb and you were like you

(7:49:54) were offended that she dropped the f bomb of course and so you never say something like that you know she said

(7:50:01) the f word and you were like offended and you're like no no no I'm going to Mo

(7:50:08) I'm going to do a certain uh he didn't do anything till she

(7:50:15) attacked him for yeah see I knew it I don't know I don't know it was she

(7:50:21) didn't do anything more than it was all happen so fast see what I remember was I was just minding my own business staring

(7:50:27) at the sky and she like came back and tried to dress me down and then I was like I curled like this to protect

(7:50:34) myself from the onslaught and I was like then my voice came out a little high pitched and I was like yeah and then she

(7:50:41) freaked the [ __ ] out about it oh yeah the you did the voice thing yeah yeah yeah but I always do that when I'm

(7:50:48) panicking look it was very I had no I had no choice she was coming right at me

(7:50:54) she came right at you me you really had no other op yeah she was coming right for me

(7:50:59) okay yeah and like you know look I think it was also you were jonesing a little bit for a cigarette and that's why your

(7:51:04) hand kind of like you were like I'm really I need some nicotine and so your hands kind of sound like it sounds like

(7:51:12) a Bill Clinton sort of situation well that depends on what the meaning of his is I mean look Andrew did nothing Andrew

(7:51:21) did nothing wrong did nothing wrong nothing wrong minding my own business she came out of

(7:51:27) nowhere she came out of nowhere she came out of nowhere it was ridiculous very vicious very vicious vicious woman yes

(7:51:35) vicious vicious woman it's a good thing she didn't have any octopus cuz she would slapped you with the

(7:51:43) octopus she was looking for something toit I was worried she's going to pick up her glass and [ __ ] Chuck it at

(7:51:49) there's still time y'all there's an octopus piece right there that would make some great television all right I'm

(7:51:55) going to do these last few and then we're just getting okay what about Bob Bryan hope you can consider inviting men who don't realize their simps on the

(7:52:07) out to him uh once or twice I don't I didn't hear back he probably isn't

(7:52:14) interested I mean it's a controversial show and he like appeals to women so just probably not did you guys know I only exclusively debate women you didn't

(7:52:21) know that true what did that one about me being delusional say wait Michael Jones donated $30 we watch it called

(7:52:28) Brian a little man serious Andrew mocked her calling her deaf and stupid albe it

(7:52:34) in a very obviously joking manner she walked over to Andrew and tried to intimidate him serious now I kind of

(7:52:41) want to see it should we she did try to intimate Blake you want to try to find the portion where she wait but hold on

(7:52:48) no we probably shouldn't do it again cuz all the slurs all the slurs yeah I'll we'll look at it again I'll I'll post it

(7:52:54) on Twitter it's possible you guys didn't hear that could be it you probably didn't hear it because she wasn't near a

(7:53:01) mic but she came back over here and started tear laying into me and then

(7:53:07) that's when I that's when I went at her also there's a a portion of the show where we had gone like I went

(7:54:50) know or did itate did I read

(7:54:57) it this one did I read it yeah you did oh no

(7:55:03) that's from a long time ago but there was another one that just came in it it was the delusional one I didn't get to see yeah I'll find it sorry guys can you

(7:55:12) hide that just hide that one uh where is it sorry guys wait what

(7:55:18) the heck I just don't want to I mean he sent

(7:55:23) in a super chat I don't want to screw the guy over here here let me see if there's a chat that came in

(7:55:29) W Watson donated $30 thank you Brian for telling the truth Andrew just check the video back

(7:55:36) on your phone you started mocking her voice and that was the reason she approached

(7:55:42) you she wouldn't get to you wait wa wait that's true that is that is the case that I did start mocking your voice

(7:55:47) before she came to me but what I'm saying is the thing that led to me mock your voice was she came over and started

(7:55:53) trying to dress me down I did so she came over and she was like and you with that Korean girl you

(7:56:00) don't mock people's blah blah and then I was like then I started making fun of her oh wait yes yes you're I you're

(7:56:06) actually right yes I am she so she called me a little man this is she said

(7:56:11) Brian you're a little man then she got up and left I was just sitting here and then she came over to me and was like

(7:56:16) and you with that Korean girl you were dressing down her culture and bl she started going at me and then I mocked

(7:56:22) her that's that's 100% right actually I forgot about the whole like it was probably with it to do with the balance

(7:56:28) stuff yeah and then I mocked her and then that's when she ran over but she but you're absolutely wrong Wes [ __ ]

(7:56:35) Watson you were wrong [ __ ] you're wrong take your L [ __ ] take your L

(7:56:40) big guys L's in the chat L's in the chat [ __ ] and by the way Andrew even if

(7:56:45) she didn't say that stuff about like the Korean thing uh her conduct even if she

(7:56:50) didn't even address you directly her conduct was egregious and I think you would have been warranted to have mocked

(7:56:56) her even if she didn't say the but it just happens that I didn't that I was just

(7:57:03) like staying out of it she was heading out and I just like was minding my own business and then she came back and was

(7:57:09) like and you Jay donated $30 Focus Burrito Boy Brian and Andrew
