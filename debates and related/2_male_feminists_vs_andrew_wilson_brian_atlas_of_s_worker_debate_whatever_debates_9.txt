() 

(3:03) involved in the sex work industry uh so we're going to be talking about is sex work good for society is sex work good

(3:10) for sex workers and should sex work be legalized or illegal but in addition to that you did have some criticism

(3:17) specifically about the whatever podcast so we we'd totally be open to engage

(3:22) with with those and hear your uh criticisms so what you what you got oh

(3:27) could you just tilt your mic down just a little bit okay how would you improve the show the hate on Brian Atlas stemmed

() 

(3:34) from I was hanging out with a girl it was our we were on a date beautiful date good night and then I bring her over

(3:41) after and you know we're kissing getting our smoochies on and then she starts freaking out she gets a

(3:47) text from her manager and says [ __ ] I got to do the whatever podcast tomorrow the last time I left crying he was so

(3:54) mean to us he literally screamed at us there was 5 minutes left and he's like you want to [ __ ] leave get the [ __ ]

(4:00) out and you know we were there 7 hours for him we drove 4 hours you know there in B old time and then he just so mean

(4:06) to us I don't want to do it but my manager says cuz he gets views it's good it's good for for my only fans and for

(4:12) my career so I have to go and starts kind of tearing up that's where it started CU I saw your clips and I was

(4:19) like you know anyone doing what I do shout out to them but then I thought whoa whoa whoa this is baby girl that I

(4:25) you know I'm getting romantic wait wait hang on hang on you're [ __ ] criticism is that you're a white knight bro what's

(4:32) that mean White Knight you're white nighting and sing for some porn sing That's simping No I gave she

(4:40) gave you take on she gave you the he was mean and you're like oh that son of a [ __ ] you know why because she's a young

(4:46) girl and I don't think we should hit women I don't think we should verbally abuse women especially not publicly did

(4:51) you kiss her ass gets their asses it says a lot about how Andrew thinks of women to to respect

(4:57) them is sing for them and I think that's [ __ ] disgusting oh baby I'm so sorry that

(5:03) that mean Brian at did he make you cry by to challenging your worldview sweetheart oh I'm so what I did

(5:10) was I messaged from her account she said and so Brian asked for notes before and

(5:16) I wrote In from her account hey this is Ryan from pillow talk I forgot what I said but like [ __ ] you for making you

(5:21) know be nice stop being mean to these [ __ ] girls so that's what I did I went straight to the man and I you know

(5:28) handled it to be such I watched and you were nicer Brian which which I was happy about but then I watched that stream and

(5:35) then one of the girl her friend Aurora this was Avery her friend Aurora who's very young I think she's 18 her phone

(5:41) started ringing when it got locked away and you like lost [ __ ] and started screaming at her and I said [ __ ] this

(5:49) guy anyone who screams and verbally abuses women like that publicly cute

(5:54) little 18-year-olds that just drove here hours and sat through this just to support you and your show

(6:00) you're screaming at them I just think that's terrible don't you sit on sets where they're getting [ __ ] by 30-year-old men in the

(6:09) mouth what yeah that has nothing concern screaming at people but the concern is

(6:14) you know what I told you to silence your phone and you didn't right that's too much the dick in the mouth from the

(6:20) 30-year-old totally acceptable well I mean losing your cool at someone is definitely not

(6:26) cool wait I want to make I just want to make sure got this right you have been

(6:31) on sets I've watched your content right where you say that you've watched these same age women getting [ __ ] in the

(6:38) mouth is that correct that is correct Andrew okay I support consensual sex

(6:44) work where they're their choice and they're happy to do just not just not consensual I don't consens put your put your phone in here

(6:51) and put it on vibrate so that you don't interrupt the show if you're comparing them doing their career versus a a man

(6:57) screaming at 18yearold different [ __ ] I mean also this isn't exactly like Jimmy Kimmel right at the end of the day

(7:03) if the phone goes off people go [ __ ] I sneeze I cough there's a [ __ ] homeless guy playing music across the street right if someone [ __ ] up you

(7:11) don't need to yell at them right you could just be like not a dick right if I'm getting a [ __ ] in my mouth it's my

(7:17) choice if I'm hanging out and you start yelling at me I'm going to be like bro I don't need this like you're a [ __ ] loser you got to communicate via yelling

(7:24) I just want I just want to make sure that I'm crystal clear on before move to your next criticism you know could you

(7:30) from random stranger 18-year-old mouth fine Brian gets a little loud because

(7:36) she has to go get her phone that bad yes you want to make sure that we're clear on that we we're very clear on that yeah

(7:42) no you know what it's not that specific thing it's just abusing physically or

(7:47) verbally women I don't stand I don't think that what you for a living I don't think what you do for a living can be

(7:53) really well so he yells at women for a living and I don't like that I think go

(7:58) yell at men I've never seen you guys yell at men yeah which is crazy cuz we came in here and you're a very nice guy

(8:03) so to see you lose your cool I don't know if you're playing it up for the show or did you really lose your cool

(8:08) I'm curious well so first off I think you are to some degree mischaracterize

(8:14) mischaracterizing the interaction that I specifically had with Aurora granted we have two episodes a week that are eight

(8:21) hours long I don't commit to memory precisely every interaction I have although I'd be happy to actually pull

(8:27) it up and review it without fully knowing exactly committed to memory how

(8:32) that interaction went it could have been the case that her phone went off three times during the show if I

() 

(8:40) recall so yes it would it was it would have been frustrating the back but this

(8:46) that's [ __ ] up joking about it is funny oh no it's too much just the way I

(8:51) was raised was to respect did you Gallop up here with a white differ did you Gallop up on a white is your white horse

(8:56) out there do you have it hooked that's how you look at men that respect women white night [ __ ] come on women women

(9:04) are equal to men right oh okay great unless we talk to them like they're men then that that's too much that's too

(9:11) much you guys don't talk to them like they're men yeah you started yelling at me I'd be like yo [ __ ] out of here like

(9:17) I'm not getting paid for this this isn't my job I came here to hang right and if you're going to lose your cooling me I'm

(9:23) like dude like I don't need you yeah but you're going to have adversarial conversations which which how the show

(9:29) is pitch yeah they're going to get heated and I I told Brian straight up I said I thought you were meaner than you

(9:34) were when I made that video saying [ __ ] Brian I thought he would say like you're [ __ ] you're never going to get married

(9:39) that's not true he asked questions to set them up for viral Clips to make them look stupid so it's different so that's

(9:45) why I said you know what we're not going to go personal job at the end of the day this is a business right hang on let me uh let me correct a couple things though

(9:51) absolutely 100% do not set women up to say stupid things I don't even know the

(9:57) questions when I come in no idea they just say stupid things cuz a lot of

(10:03) these women are [ __ ] stupid now I just want to make sure that we're crystal clear you understand what I'm

(10:08) saying a lot of the women who come in they're not set up they just say really

(10:14) [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] right I mean if you did the show with men it' be the same thing look at us right now absolutely a

(10:20) lot of people say stupid [ __ ] right yeah so so when you characterize it as a setup right there's no setup they just

(10:27) say [ __ ] stupid [ __ ] now it's it's hilarious to clip it and put it out there because they said something [ __ ] stupid every bit is every bit as

(10:35) much as it would be for any man yeah I mean at the end of the day they're not interviewing SMART Girls right cuz then that wouldn't go viral oh I mean I'm

(10:41) sorry they have degrees in Psychology they have degrees in mathematics they have uh University master's degrees many

(10:48) of these women come in can't wait to do a debate and they say the stupidest [ __ ] on planet Earth who could we get who

(10:54) would be up to the standards that you would have of an intelligent woman what

(10:59) would we need besides a master's degree high education like what what what do you want us to go get a [ __ ]

(11:06) scientist like what do you want us to go get what women can we find that aren't going to say this [ __ ] [ __ ] that's

(11:11) what I want to know and that's where I think that now that I've actually talked to you guys for about an hour I don't

(11:17) think Brian disrespects women I don't Andrew I'm not sure yet not enough I think if your show if you saw the value

(11:24) in do an 8 Hour show promoting them you would have gone the complete other way you're going where the bag is so I don't

(11:30) think you hate them and I don't think you want to disrespect them I don't think you sleep better at night knowing I really stuck it to that girl I think

(11:36) you're the circus Le in a clown show that's literally what we all do that's what I do for a living that's what you do for a living you surround yourself by

(11:42) people who provide you interesting debate and conversation cuz if you talk to [ __ ] the same kind of people on

(11:48) your wavelength all day like no one's tuning in they want to hear Howard Stern s conversations right janic donated $100

(11:57) thank you I respect built his living around exploiting 18-year-old women in a evil and destructive industry K to find

(12:06) a Duo of creeps who values women less than you too is that at you guys no that's at you oh nice is living around

(12:13) hold on Yo giovan thank you first of all it's not cool that you have your little Fanboys coming in chiming in why not

(12:20) because we don't have that privilege now it's an off now you guys have an advantage you have call a friend your

(12:25) fan your Fanboys can chime in right now I didn't promote the show oh well which fault is that I sent you the link you

(12:31) told you before the show but in fact before the show you said depending on my

(12:36) performance on the show I'm reluctant to actually promote itely yeah cuz we're

(12:42) the dumb [ __ ] in this we don't know where we're not Debaters this I've never done this he's a profession what you say fastest growing debat in the world we

(12:48) don't know what we're walking into for all I know you prepped the [ __ ] you prepped we contest well so let's let's

(12:55) go back to the then I that I would that would not take that as a mark of like success if I had prepped Biden first

(13:00) last debate I just want to let you know that that would not be yeah i' would be

(13:05) pretty ashamed of myself for that one I mean so let's go back to the original claim so you originally said there's

(13:10) this girl cell phone went off I yelled at her Nick if you can find the clip uh

(13:16) I might have show I I'll concede that I so I'll certainly concede that I get frustrated on the show because a lot of

(13:22) these people are not media trained camera trained Etc grid One Motorsports donated $100

(13:30) about to start my show but she at these dudes bro you ain't got a white KN so

(13:36) hard the women do that for you on stage on demand these women are the definition

(13:41) of mental midgets all right thank you midgets under the bus there you go that's crazy

(13:46) but he should have used dwarves you're right first of all right the MW is as

(13:52) bad now as I'm wor it's little people in fact you had a a little person I you

(13:57) know what I think I thought dwarf was still valid the dwarf is actually a category it's under a certain height I

(14:03) thought they prefer dwarf I don't like the they little person little mythical yeah dwarf is the old one you're right

(14:10) but they have beards but now I believe myal don't call me I think DW I think it fits dwarf is a smaller one now I

(14:15) believe it's under 38 perhaps I'm not sure I think little person they like m word not cool disregard that guy claims

(14:22) he's using slurs he's he's going to get cancelled grid one you are not helping our so

(14:29) don't use the m word I'm like that is the euphemism treadmill though so uh I

(14:35) guess [ __ ] used to be acceptable now it's not dwarf was acceptable now it's eh I know where now it's a little person

(14:42) so in any case going back to the criticisms uh I don't think when you say like I yelled and screamed at her I mean

(14:48) you guys are kind of almost yelling and screaming at us I I have a pretty softspoken voice I'm just you you do I'm

(14:54) that's how I be I have ADHD no I'm not upset by have every letter in the book I'm not upset by it but I I might you

(15:00) know increase my volume a little bit and might be a bit frustrated but uh at least when it came to her phone

(15:05) specifically I don't think I was verbally abusive to her when it came to her phone wait question for you that guy

(15:11) paid $9 to write that comment and he called us [ __ ] soy boys no no he paid $100 $100 to write that and I'm the

(15:19) loser I love it I'm going to start paying in a second for our team on the side these two guys are really good

(15:26) Debaters so and your bag boys but we are in the studio debating just saying yeah

(15:32) yeah yeah yeah we're here we're happy to be here so I guess going back to the criticisms you use the term verbal abuse

(15:38) so what how do you consider verbal what do you consider verbal abuse like if

(15:44) they're on the set and they're like take it [ __ ] is that verbal abuse take it [ __ ] yeah yeah if you're if they're

(15:50) like [ __ ] yeah yeah no no you see okay so just so you know

(15:56) Andrew is that is that verbal abuse no but when toting porn how it works just so you know is it's very safe happy

(16:03) environment where you go over what they want what they don't want the nose safe wordss all this and that and then

(16:08) there's always a director on that's very nice of them yeah so before they go and cream this [ __ ] girl's face with

(16:14) eight guys and she's going to have that video out for the rest of her life before they do that they want to make

(16:19) sure that they know her no no words yeah got to make sure that's too that's one dick too many right they're there cuz

(16:26) it's they want to be there it's a safe environment it's their choice to be there and that's all that matters it's what they want to do in a certain choice

(16:32) I mean wanting a there's nothing wrong with that I don't think that that's all that matters I you should [ __ ] on someone I think that we basically uh

(16:38) Outlaw all sorts of behavior that people want to do because it's really [ __ ] bad behavior and so you just you know do

(16:45) you have sex Andrew mhm with who my wife you do you have sex with your wife yeah no ring all

(16:51) right I have my ring oh you wear it on the neck MH good for you so okay so you

(16:57) have sex with your wife mhm they're doing the same thing Andrew they're having sex with their wife in most cases

() 

(17:03) there are married C sex premarital sex I'm just curious dude I yeah sure is that like cuz I here's the thing I'm not

(17:10) religious in any way so do your beliefs and all this stem from a religious background or just like you just

(17:16) personally look at it and go like that's gross both ways so one I would say it's sinful but I I would never be able to

(17:22) convince you guys of that I wouldn't even bother trying well but what I can look at is I can look at the societal

(17:27) damage and how [ __ ] horrific it is mentally on women to be involved in sex work and none of them end up with a good

(17:32) result why do you care about these people because this is the society I live in right but I don't care about

(17:39) anyone because here's what I would hope here's what I would hope I and I would never get it from you guys right but

(17:44) here's what I would hope and wish more than anything that'd be driving down the [ __ ] road in my shitty car and the

(17:50) tire goes and Bam I hit a rock and I'm [ __ ] dead my daughters are orphaned

(17:55) right and they're struggling and one of their friends goes hey you know what you you could go to this shoot and suck a dick and they'll pay you 20 grand and

(18:02) she goes you know what that sounds like easy money I wish to God before they walk in that studio somebody like me' be

(18:07) like no don't do that do anything but that work as a [ __ ] Barista go do

(18:14) anything but this right that's what I would hope but that's not the world we

(18:19) live in look I'm not going to debate you on that but if someone chooses to go into that it's like ah I mean working at

(18:26) Starbucks is arguably more degrading to your body Tak yeah why can't somebody choose to

(18:31) [ __ ] a dead body well they can then do you have any moral quals with that nope because the body's dead no one's getting

(18:37) hurt so it's fine who's getting hurt so if they walk over and they grab roadkill off the road and start [ __ ] it you

(18:43) have no moral objection to that none UL is the Pagan donated

(18:49) $100 tone policing is controlling speech and opinions is an end runaround to

(18:54) control modes of expression which is the means to control the narrative control that and you control Society

(19:02) just stop I feel like I'm playing like [ __ ] like Dungeons and Dragons I never know that sounded like a quest you

(19:08) know what I think beyond the issue of them choosing to do that is they do have a lot of mental health issues when they

(19:14) do it not all of them doesn't have they do a lot of people mental health issues don't you have mental health issues you

(19:20) believe in God toone Poli you exploit women making

(19:26) them into literal [ __ ] and you want to tone don't police me dude you fail that

(19:32) 100 bucks cuz I just made him spend another hundred that's our 100 wait so hold so hold on wa wait wait wait hold

(19:39) hold on wait wait wait hold on so let's explore a couple of the claims so so hang on I just want to make sure I got this clear okay me believing in God to

(19:46) use a mental health issue but [ __ ] a dead body also a mental health issue no

(19:52) I wait why is that a mental health issue it is [ __ ] weird you have no moral issues with it at all well yeah I don't

(19:59) really give a [ __ ] about it I also don't care that you believe in God because you don't affect me yeah but if I did

(20:05) Implement those morals of you can't [ __ ] dead body cuz gross and immoral but what's gross anal sex but immoral

(20:12) immoral to have sex with a dead body you would say what you're hurting my bodily

(20:18) autonomy like that that's too much for you is that one line too much hey we did not come here to debate [ __ ] dead

(20:24) people that is f i didn't I'm just I'm just asking so so let me ask this can you back can I just ask you a question dude what is the where does sex stop

(20:33) being gross or start being gross for you yeah so I'm not making an ick argument I'm not saying I'm not going to sit here

() 

(20:40) and tell you what type of sexual intercourse with a female is going to be gross or not gross or tasteful or not

(20:45) tasteful I don't think it's really relevant what is relevant though is that to say that we can put no restrictions

(20:50) on consenting sex insane we do it all the time for instance do you think that a brother should be able to [ __ ] his

(20:56) sister I don't I don't so I don't think so uh cuz it's gross yeah but that's my

(21:03) opinion but guess what someone else is going to think that's okay is it immoral is it immoral uh according to today's

(21:09) society sure but uh half the world does it yeah do you think it's immoral I

(21:14) think it's some [ __ ] immoral to f a lot of things in this world is that immoral or not is that immoral what's

(21:19) immoral to you where do you get your morals they're invented by man right morals right they're not what they

(21:24) passed down to you by God if it's just subjective right and I don't know how you call anything immoral ever that's

(21:30) what so there you go like if you think it's someone could find sitting next to a sex doll immoral so then from your

(21:36) world viiew then you have to understand what that would mean that would mean that you couldn't say serial killers were immoral you couldn't say that uh

(21:43) child underage didders were immoral you couldn't say anything was immoral if your claim is we just make up morality

(21:50) we do make up morality well then if we do just make up morality have no objective metric for which to call

(21:55) anything a moral ever that's kind of how works nothing anything does is immoral it just depends on society standards and

(22:02) right now having eight [ __ ] in your mouth isn't illegal so if society says one day if they do want to be sure to be

(22:08) I just want to make sure that we're clear in your worldview then if society says that you can DD kids totally moral no what do you mean

(22:15) no I don't think so wait why not absolutely not cuz I can disagree with things too but I don't disagree with a

(22:21) person taking what would the basis be to make the disagreement if it's just a subjective metric uh if murder was legal

(22:28) still would be like yeah that's kind of whack why because I don't just doesn't

(22:33) feel right just how seeing a girl take eight dick doesn't feel right for you this is a personal opinion so can you

(22:39) legislate based on it doesn't feel right no you can't that's why why do you legislate against against murderers and kid diddlers dude I don't [ __ ] make

(22:46) the rules would you uh no you wouldn't no cuz I'm a piece of [ __ ] so you so you

(22:52) wouldn't legislate against kid dlers oh I would do that okay well then if you would do that then you would legislate based on based on it gives me the ick

(23:00) right uh it would be based on the fact that a child can't make up its own

(23:05) decisions and it's [ __ ] a child yeah but your entire basis for what is moral

(23:10) you just told me is based literally on your subjective metric of your preference of I don't like

(23:16) it for me yeah we all have it's called morals like we have our own right so if you have your own morals yes you say

(23:23) that the kid did they bad yes then what would and you would legislate against it based on your own

(23:29) why could legislate this I say B moral I'm not I don't care about your opinion just

(23:36) like you don't care about mine well no no no see I do live yeah unfortunately you don't know who I am until we just

(23:42) met you can vote he can vote I live in a society he can't vote he's from Canada yeah yeah well he can still vote he's

(23:47) going to become a citizen he told me right well we'll see thing is is that the so if you wonder why I care why do

(23:53) you care why do you care what all these people do why do you give a [ __ ] so much is because if they just go of our

(23:58) morality name taken donated $100 Andrew what you bring to the podcast man but you've cut Brian off a

(24:05) few times now it's a little Annoying for the viewers probably for Brian oh and

(24:11) these two guys suck it it's the nature of a fastpaced

(24:17) show like this people cut each other off Andrew do be talking a lot I feel like I haven't I haven't got the Talking Stick

(24:22) you guys say you disagree a lot Brian where's Brian hold on hold on you got to allow Andrew to finish his argument okay

(24:28) but name take and thank for the message I feel like I'm in class right now my Rd if everybody just has these kind of

(24:33) subjective metrics for what is moral and it's all just coming from our own personal preference or purview or this or that you have no basis to say one

(24:40) that anything is immoral or two that me legislating any of my morals would be any worse than you doing it so if I say

(24:47) sex work is unequivocally evil and bad you would have no basis to tell me I'm wrong yeah I don't but I don't care

(24:53) about your opinion I can discuss that that's the debate so if the debate is just sure if you and the rest of you

(24:59) Christian populist Outlaw sex work more power to you hey if you get the [ __ ] job done God bless you so so how come

(25:06) you guys don't bring on male performers I we just did we brought on two male performers you have any problems with

(25:12) them Andrew yeah yeah yeah I debate them all the time okay I've never seen you guys also I debate red pill gurus well

(25:20) you have to understand when you say you guys Sterling Cooper we had whatever podcast is Brian Atlas I'm just a guest

(25:27) right my show yeah I debate with them all the time okay absolutely happy to do has anyone ever changed your opinion

(25:33) yeah I've had my opinion change about tons of things okay especially interactive the way that men and women interactively date how it operates in

(25:40) the in the year 2024 a lot of the reasons people move towards sex work there was all sorts of presuppositions I

(25:46) had which were completely and totally untrue absolutely and what I've come to

(25:51) is interestingly enough I actually go into debates with open minds right but when somebody says it's okay to [ __ ] a

(25:57) dead body obviously I'm not I at that point I'm like ah I'm not so sure that that your opinion on this is

(26:04) great but the thing is is uh I still want to listen to why they think what they think I want to understand why it

(26:10) is that they believe what it is that they believe and what I found is this unequivocally uh almost every sex worker

(26:17) I've talked to regrets it at the end of their at the end of their Road when they're all done they always look back

(26:23) and say I wish I hadn't done that and if you talk to them privately they say you're absolutely [ __ ] right and I wish more people would do something

(26:30) about this industry I'm going to chime in there I'm going to chime in there I know these girls very well a lot of them are close friends of mine [ __ ] them yeah

(26:37) I have yeah yeah I have and I know them very well and I get close with them outside the show and these are my my

() 

(26:43) best friends and favorite people and I totally disagree with you not most of them regret it not most of them are

(26:49) pissed that they did it and would have made different choices a lot of them rep it and are very happy how many of the ones who are retired are you uh getting

(26:56) a lot of them I I talked to a lot of the ones that are retired they're very very happy with first of all they made a very

(27:01) big career for themselves a lot of them made multi multi-millions most sex workers don't make [ __ ] I mean would you

(27:07) treat it like any other job how many people do I talk to that hate their job still right it's like they got into sex

(27:12) work but being a plumers a lot of them actually love what they do if you take mil like sharid DeVille Alexis Fox 20

(27:20) years in the business multi-millionaire celebrities yeah that's the to that's the top top top top top top shoo five

(27:26) scenes a day cuz they love it you take a girl like Luna Star she's been doing this 12 years she's married to Michael

(27:32) baay worth $600 million she married to Michael ba yes or or about to get married but they're dating they're

(27:37) living together still shoots every day because she loves it these are not she's happy she wants to shoot these are not

(27:44) the common denominator for sex workers you're you're pointing at the top top top top top 1.1.1 percenti it' be like

(27:52) me telling uh people hey everybody should do a podcast because uh Destiny's

(27:58) multi-millionaire right so you guys are that would be [ __ ] nuts to say if I said that I would be setting people up

(28:03) for let's talk about only fans girls then so that's the degree or is the sex work also back to like just like

(28:09) someone's hooking behind a dumpster for $5 [ __ ] right yeah I mean I would that's more the speed versus top%

(28:17) consider all of it to be under the same pervie of degeneracy when I say degeneracy so you understand what that

(28:22) means it just means without morals so like somebody who says I don't if you [ __ ] a dead body or you [ __ ] kill it's

(28:28) fine I consider that to be absent morals because you say all morality is subjective it's just up to my purview

(28:35) therefore what I say is moral what you say is moral what you say is moral what you say is moral right that's all the

(28:40) absence of morality you guys ever joke around in these debates cuz like I'm not pro [ __ ] dead bod you know like I

(28:48) didn't just come on here to be like stiff now I I also want to clarify chill

(28:53) here you guys stiffened up real quick once the C very Broad bubble of this

(28:59) whole thing I don't know [ __ ] about prostitution it's illegal in many states and a lot of times people choices I'm

() 

(29:05) here to stand up for adult stars doing adult films and then only fans girls

(29:10) girls everyday girls that sell exclusive content how is a corn starter not a prostitute bro that's a prostitute

(29:17) absolutely not abely not so the so as long as I give you money as long as I have a camera in your face it's not hook

(29:22) see that argument gets told to me all the time ar ar a Terri

(29:29) in the wise words of Andre V the poorest man in the world still sees himself

(29:34) richer than a degenerate porn star and so does everyone else see these are the people men in the world is like what

(29:42) women CH building an let me you the AR let's let's investigate this claim what

(29:47) so what in this statement here has anything to do with woman hating are you kidding he's saying the

(29:53) poorest men on Earth is still richer because a girl should shoots adult films

(29:58) on her own terms no yeah so that's that's bro you know what kind of bum you have to be to be a broke man you think

(30:04) that guy he got the quote wrong here's the quot to be a broke guy in 2024 but here's what the quote is the quote is is

(30:09) that the poorest man in the world will always consider himself richer than a [ __ ] somebody who allows somebody else to purposely [ __ ] their wife the poorest

(30:16) man said I know he got it wrong but what the quote actually is yeah I mean I agree with that one yeah is that the

(30:22) poorest man in the world will always consider themselves richer than the man who shares his wife do you want to talk about that cuts

(30:28) we could get into that too maybe later maybe later but um Andrew Carill you said something about uh broke men are

(30:35) are bums or I I don't want to misquote you just could you repeat cuz oh I was just you know if he's if you're going to

(30:41) the extreme of the poorest man in the world you're like why are we using that guy as a metric imagine but like a broke

(30:47) dude well to just make the parall has no purpose unless yeah it's just to make the parallel that materialis I get it

(30:53) yeah I saying and Carill if I can could you just scoot your mic to the edge of the table yeah and we just want to get

(30:58) you a bit more into frame are you able to just scoot a little closer that way his lap yeah a little cuddle sesh wait

(31:05) and you said I mean it wouldn't be a moral right not at all uh Carell you you said that

(31:11) um he a broke man has no purpose yeah like no value in yeah absolutely not

(31:17) what are you doing is a broke dude like I have broke dude friends and I'm like how are you surviving in this

(31:22) world well certainly you need resources to survive if they have no value they wouldn't be your friends right

(31:28) right if they have no uh they're my friends but you just look you're like oh

(31:33) I can't believe you're like a bum I mean but I mean like you don't have friends

(31:39) that are like broke and you're like or like when you hear about broke dudes you're like what is that sure I have friends who it's fine if you're 21 and

(31:45) broke it's the OG High School homies you know but I mean do you think they didn't make it out but I mean I'm sure you've

(31:51) encountered friends of your own perhaps they even were wealthy at one point but business failed he health problem

(31:59) catastrophic health problem get I'm talking to extremes too so you know but

(32:04) so um by the way Andrew did you want to do your open or are you happy just keeping it yeah we just keep wait we

(32:10) didn't even start yet what's an open no we're live you guys we're live I feel like you guys prepped more than us cuz

(32:15) we didn't even get questions you don't need to prep the guys are special we're going dog we sent you four questions and

(32:21) we honestly me and Andrew have done five shows this week we did not have much

(32:26) time to prep Fair we did a little prep a little prep uh but we didn't even prep in the car we were just talking about my

(32:32) L and my but we're ready we're [ __ ] ready

(32:37) question for you Carill I Andrew might we can explore this for a few minutes

() 

(32:42) here um you mentioned something about religion uh do you view you said something along the lines of uh and

(32:49) correct me if I'm wrong you view uh religious people or religion is a mental illness yeah yes okay I just isible and

(32:58) imaginary friend in the sky is a mental illness okay isn't mental illness invisible and imaginary I don't know I'm

(33:05) not a scientist I'm just throwing around Buzz words and saying that someone who talks to if I have a friend that talks

(33:10) every night at the edge of their bed to someone in the sky yeah it's a little [ __ ] weird I'm like that guy's probably a little nuts in this day and

(33:18) age I understand if you're like 70 like my grandma you're about to meet God you're like all right let me try to at least he said you're Jewish but

(33:24) non-practicing yeah never uh so like ethnic or were were you Rel born in

(33:30) Russia my you know just Russian Jew that escaped I got circumcised at age s so it

(33:35) wasn't really like a thing circumcisions weren't like a thing in Russia uh grid One Motorsports say what you want but no

(33:40) grown ass man wants another dude to be able to ask him how his deck tastes that is what kissing a chick that's had nine

(33:47) [ __ ] in her bro hav't talked about C we're too messy L we need to structure

(33:53) this debate cuz I could talk on the cucks no nobody want

(33:58) thank you because I feel that I feel that but we we just let so so I would just kind

(34:04) of argue that I think it's far more delusional far more delusional to think that a group of like 20 to 30y old men's

(34:12) gangbanging an 18-year-old chick and you thinking well it's okay because she consented to it that the ramifications

(34:18) of that how could that be less delusional than me thinking ah you know maybe there is a Divine Creator based on

(34:25) the fact that everything has order which makes no sense right but my whole thing is my identity isn't based in bashing

(34:30) either I don't [ __ ] on you and I don't [ __ ] on them I just kind of live my life right but I I you know I just don't like

(34:37) religious people and I have no problem with you know porn stars because you

(34:42) know we have similar problems do you think you can be a porn star no I'm literally a White Russian Jewish kid not

(34:48) you I'm asking do you let me finish the question sorry do you think that you could be a porn star while you identify

(34:54) as being a Christian at the same time I don't know enough about religion to tell you

(35:01) like like to be like to could you I don't know I don't know like what are

(35:06) the rules that ask you guys a question about about the Bible I don't know [ __ ] so correct me if I'm wrong and I'm just

(35:11) asking but Mary Magdalene wasn't she a prostitute no that Jesus said come hang

(35:18) out with the 12 disciples no she was not she was not a prostitute pretty sure that's 100% positive Mary Magdalene was

(35:25) not a prostitute that's why is that a you can't be 100% positive no it's not a bunch of [ __ ] atheists say this the

(35:32) Bible nowhere says that Mary Magdalene was a prostitute ever and nowhere Nick

(35:38) Nick Nick can pull it up Nick pull it up yep I I'm pretty sure I don't know [ __ ] absolutely not a prostitute 100 I

(35:46) have you just SC you uh you can I feel like you're continually just trying to get me to make out but some of the

(35:52) Christian relig uh they interpret it that way correct the mic there could be some

(35:57) protest sex that would would probably not be considered Christian but could identify themselves as being Christian

(36:03) why they think that she's a prostitute because people can think all kinds of crazy [ __ ] it's not a rumor is it it's

(36:09) just a rumor like there must be something in the Bible that led read anything anything can be interpreted

(36:16) incorrectly by anybody yeah but there must a paragraph or what do they call them a a what do you call those John 8

(36:23) what do you call mhm a Bible stump that that says she was a protitute there's not

(36:30) okay there it is she was not a prostitute now back one more thing on your religion though you up is yeah we

(36:36) can pull it up go ahead Nick Mary Magdalene as it seems according to scripture was likely not a

(36:42) prostitute likely not not they're saying she is but maybe she wasn't a slight

(36:47) chance that woman sucked a dick for a dollar or like a baging she's likely not a prostitute that doesn't sound like

(36:53) what it means is there's not any evidence for that it's just made up well there's not much evidence about anything in the Bible there's a lot of evidence

(36:58) for a lot of things in the Bible let's not even go there so you brought it up I didn't bring up I didn't

(37:04) bring it up hey I don't know enough about religion I just think it's weird to talk to a guy isn't one of The

(37:09) Commandments that you can't have sex before marriage yeah and you in adultery yeah that's true so so in your religion

(37:16) you broke the one of the 10 mega rules yeah one of the Ten Commandments correct so you're [ __ ] you're not going to

(37:21) heaven no that's incorrect so what are the rules do you care about breaking that rule yeah like and what how how

(37:27) does it like why do you care like why do you care so from from from our world

() 

(37:33) view my world viw yeah um think of think of your body like a cup and every time

(37:38) you sin it fills up a little bit more right this is the idea of sin sin sin

(37:44) itself right can be kind of partitioned this way so basically the more that you

(37:49) sin the sicker your soul gets okay that's the prism of the world view and so you shouldn't do it now there's ways

(37:56) for you to comp he's about to fill your soul right one of the one of the things that you can water boy I'm not even part

(38:02) of this one of the things you can do is you can repent and then you do everything you can to not do the sin

(38:08) anymore that's the goal right now how do you take that nobody's expecting Perfection right and then I see these TV

(38:14) shows where you know all the time and serial killers are going to repent and be like okay good out of my system and

(38:20) we don't have to get into all this cuz it's not what we came for but I just think you were [ __ ] before yeah so

(38:27) what so what so now you're going you're using Christianity against porn stars and it devalues when you were [ __ ]

(38:33) before marriage that's really weird if you smoke cigarettes would you tell your kids they could smoke cigarettes not

(38:38) about the kids it's about you saying the Christianity answer my question if you smoke cigarettes would you tell your 9-year-old they could smoke I don't

(38:45) understand what that has to do with it answer the question stop offis scating no I would not why would you be a

(38:50) hypocrite you smoke you smoke so why are you telling someone else that they can't smoke well people got to make their own

(38:56) mistakes so wait so wait hang on a second that's really weird it's almost like you can have a standard and even if

(39:03) you fall short of the standard you still know it's bad for someone else it's almost like right but get off

(39:09) the hill yeah you can't get off the [ __ ] Hill get off the high horse you know like the guy uh here's a great

(39:14) example I'm sorry am I a prostitute mother's against hang on I'm sorry am I a prostitute am am I on only fans am I

(39:21) am I getting gang banged by eight dudes like what's going on here you're [ __ ] you're [ __ ] yeah so the thing is is

(39:27) uh I also think that there's a distinct difference and distinction which you can make is a category between somebody who

(39:32) has premarital sex and somebody who's accepting money for sexual intercourse daily and getting gangbanged by dudes

(39:38) getting facials putting their [ __ ] all over the Internet why is that gross I don't understand why that's here let's

(39:43) say let me ask you I I don't get why sex is disgusting you what if I'm wrong let me just ask you a question you you would

(39:49) marry a porn star sure great then I want to ask you this question you have you have kids with this porn star boundaries

(39:58) your scenario we'll just say you did okay Little Johnny comes up to you at 9 years old and he says Hey Dad take a

(40:03) look there's mom and she's getting [ __ ] in the face by Jamal holy [ __ ] hang on hang on look what my my friend

(40:10) said this is the best part they just shoot it all all over the face now you're going to look at that and go well

(40:16) now you see little how do I expl scho to them it's all good what about all the other things I got to explain to them

(40:21) school shootings like how everything in the world is [ __ ] awful like is awful

(40:27) look if I choose to marry a porn star right then I've already in my head know what I should and shouldn't say to my

(40:35) child right tell me what tell me so so Andrew I'm not going it comes down to

(40:40) nobody wants that dude no that's not true somebody does right like somebody wants to like date a [ __ ] 900 lb girl

(40:47) they always date within their own industry most of the time for a reason and it's because they know they know

(40:53) that men they know that men see this as being shameful horrific Behavior they don't want anything to do with a chick

(40:59) who's been uh you know uh had like eight guys on her has her [ __ ] all over dis

(41:06) and I'll tell you why but the it comes down to every guy's respected boundary right you are very Pro if she did it I'm

(41:12) I'm out that's fine and you know what the girls probably wouldn't want to date you either to be honest so then there's

(41:17) guys that are happy to date a girl that are still shooting like Michael Bay he's go shoot Luna she he likes it he's into

(41:24) that you know why cuz they swing they're open he [ __ ] other girls she [ __ ] other guys maybe it [ __ ] turns them on so

(41:29) there's that too me where my boundary is and I'll tell you straight up I would date a retired porn star I would want to

(41:36) be monogamous with my retired porn star it wouldn't bother me

(41:42) $100 do you guys kids if you had a daughter and she said Dad I really want

(41:48) to get into of I love effing and the money is great if you approve you're

(41:53) garbage and you're stupid no real parent would so so so little Cynthia says Hey

(41:59) Dad you're not going to go s some dick for money cynth hey awesome Cynthia what if little Cynthia's like I want a

(42:04) liberal arts degree and spend 100 Grand on College I'd be like you're stupid too stop you don't have to do that do you think that it's kind of equivocating a

(42:11) bit to make the comparison of a liberal arts degree to getting gang banged uh I

(42:16) think that uh yeah the industry think it's equal indry this is like getting a

(42:22) liberal arts degree you know what the best thing that ever happened to the industry is only fence because now it's on their terms it's their creation it's

(42:28) their art it's their marketing it's really answering the question about little Cynthia though yeah if we can I'm

(42:33) getting there I'm getting there right now so thankfully since the industry's changed so much Camila who's been on

(42:39) here twice do you remember her she was the girl on the Mr be show cam uh dark hair blue eyes huge Florida yeah I think

(42:47) she's only been on here once I think I know who you're talking you know you know she's she does that like height Tik Tok thing where she like she's the que

(42:54) checks the guy heights yeah yeah yeah so she figured it out perfectly and I would actually encourage my daughter to do

(42:59) what she does she shows nothing on only fans at all zero but what if but she does Tik Tok and real so good catch and

(43:06) release guys come to see her naked oh [ __ ] she's not kind of sneaky way to not actually answer the question shees 500 million a month 500 million a month says

(43:14) on camia 500 million [ __ ] sorry you mean 500,000 pardon me 500,000 a month 500

(43:20) million I'm about to she might even consider we all have aice so that is what I would tell my daughter honestly

(43:26) don't show [ __ ] hook them in make what is that 5 million a year about 6 million yeah so so wait so I'm just want to make

(43:33) sure I got this clear if your daughter came to you and said that she wanted to go on and have sex and suck men's penises for money while she was being

(43:39) filmed doing it that's the question would you tell her that was okay or not I would push her towards this route

(43:45) first so that would mean the other route was not okay I think if your daughter wants to do something not the first choice I would supporter to do I would

(43:52) prefer that she did it this way first because well it's just a

(43:58) This way everything is in completely her control she never has to go onto sets

(44:03) where you know they're not perfect the porn sets that's a that's a fact and I wish they were a little bit safer cuz

(44:08) things do happen on set and I would be worried for her in that sense you know they try their best to get it right but yeah but he verbally yelled a chick for

(44:15) his cell phone though once I just I just wanted to let you know he he did verbally yell at a chick

(44:21) about her cell phone going off once but I can see we're you know on the set of one of these porn sh where this

(44:27) 18-year-old is getting gang banged you know that things don't always go right you know but Brian did yell at a chick

(44:32) one time cuz her cell phone went off that was the only stream I watched and that was enough for me okay so anyway

(44:38) back to this but back to that look I just don't like anyone hating women or

(44:45) verbally or Cyberbully that's what Brian did when I attacked him well hold on just to be

() 

(44:50) clear I've never come up with that I thought that you were verbally and then when I

(44:56) watched I realized okay no he doesn't actually go at them meanly and that's I messaged them that I'm like we don't

(45:01) have to do personal tax cuz I was actually wrong you just set them up in a way to make hold on got to challenge you

(45:07) there I don't set them up well you know what you're doing Brian you're not you're not tell me what I'm doing tell

(45:13) me what I'm doing this whole show is the opposite of mine where I do a comedy in the sense of

(45:21) bringing them up talking funny stories laughing with them yours is also almost a comedy a way of let why it simping to

(45:28) hang out see let's get them to say dumb [ __ ] thought you wanted it guys guys guys let let's let Ryan

(45:35) finish so you do it the opposite way it's a it's it's similar in the way that

(45:40) we get beautiful women in sex work to say viral [ __ ] but I say it with more of

(45:45) a positive outlook you say it with a bit more of a negative outlook well there's a couple things to clarify here so first

(45:51) off when it comes to the people that we have on the show we do have only fans girls on the show we actually had somebody recently one of our viewers uh

(45:57) painstakingly actually go through all of our episodes and do an analysis on you

(46:03) know their age profession what they um where they're from Etc and we collected

(46:10) statistics and I believe Nick could you pull up the stats really quick do we still have that pulled up it's either

(46:15) 30% or what's that it's not pulled up shoot if you can try to find it uh I think it's in one of the Dropbox folders

(46:22) in any case I it's either TW less than 20 or less than 30 I forgot the exact number

(46:27) uh I think it's 20 could be 30 less than 20 or 30% of the women we have on the show are involved in sex work in some

(46:34) capacity so we've had over a thousand guests uh I think less than 200 of them

(46:39) have been so what do you yell at them about you do one per episode for the other 7% of women well I mean we'll have

(46:44) conversations broad conversations about uh um sorry we lost the oh okay we're

(46:51) good we talk about dating related topics we'll get into culture War stuff sometimes we'll talk politics but mostly

(46:56) talk about dating uh what's wrong with yelling at chicks anyway like why is that even a problem yell at

(47:04) menell I would yell at everyone donated

(47:10) $100 I watched Brian Andrew pretty hard with a lint roller BT comical fellows I

(47:17) have it bro by the way I do you guys want the lint roller I see Carill there's a little I have OCD so there's

(47:23) like a little speck on your shirt if you want to sure you got I'm just looking out I I got I have I have a girlfriend I

(47:29) I'm not trying to get late anymore I don't care what I look like wait you missed it you just wait oh do you guys

(47:35) see it oh yeah you go let me get all the [ __ ] crusty tumb off my face the

() 

(47:40) [ __ ] that wasn't a joke that was good that was good thing and the thing is these girls do have mental health issues

(47:48) you know C from porn yeah yeah do you think it's do you think it's you

(47:53) Advocate is wa but don't you think it's before porn yeah but here's the thing here's the thing wa sorry sorry I was

(47:58) about to say something come on it's the negativity that comes with it oh the social stigma that's the word

(48:05) you're looking for it's what's hurting them the most and it's been a tough year this year there was uh suicides

(48:10) overdoses and deaths MH and I think a lot of them would not have gone all the

(48:16) way to that terrible all the way bad and dark if the world was just [ __ ] chill

(48:22) and peace and happy you want to [ __ ] on camera go have fun you know it's people that are telling them they're [ __ ]

(48:28) [ __ ] all the time people like you Andrew that are getting to their [ __ ] brains who knows we could have saved a

(48:34) [ __ ] life well okay you're you know what I'll Grant the argument for a second that it's a social stigma that

(48:39) does it so then you would have to grant that if we eliminated it if we shut the industry down they wouldn't have to deal

(48:46) with the social stigma would they yeah but that's anti- hang hang on let no way

(48:51) that's no way to do it it why is that no way to do it because if it's their choice and they're safe let them live

(48:56) let live wait for most for most of our history this was outlawed because of the ramifications of the mental illness

() 

(49:03) which came along with it because of the massive amounts of STDs that came with it and that's a big problem in that

(49:08) industry actually no oh well let's go over the rates if you think yeah but you can't die from STDs like that anymore oh

(49:13) yeah well you can't die from HIV not anymore anymore no yeah no even even now you die from HIV now you take I mean you

(49:20) could die from [ __ ] anything and you know what I've slept with a lot of women Andre I've gotten more STI from non-porn

(49:25) girls and porn girls I'll tell you right how many SDI have you gotten what that's not for debate can I slide to the right a little serious I've only had uh I've

(49:33) only had the chill ones you know yeah do you want have you had multiple times though like the CH chill you have

(49:38) permanent STDs no I do not those are the scary ones but I mean isn't it to their God but good can I ask you guys I mean

(49:46) Ry I have I'd like to finish this exchange I'm almost done and I'll tell you I've never caught anything from a

(49:52) porn star and I slept with porn star evidence shows hi civilians you know who's worse hang on the clout chased

(49:57) girls in La that are out with celebrities and they're out eights a week party we literally have the numbers that's one thing we got those girls are

(50:04) who have STDs cuz they're sleeping with rock shars who [ __ ] thousands of women that's where you're going to you got to wrap it up with them yeah they get

(50:11) tested every weeke kalal they only [ __ ] each other who get tested every well here's what the evidence good here's

(50:17) what the evidence shows evidence shows HIV prevalence among sex workers 12 times greater 12 times prosti but that's

(50:24) the industry unregulated we're talking porn who has more [ __ ] Hammer injuries than handman Andrew look up porn cuz

(50:31) you're you're taking prostitution but he's also the metric of people who do this for a let meish you're using third

(50:36) world countries that [ __ ] without condom every day 10 dudes a day for a b you're not letting me finish so you you can't

(50:42) even understand the AR finish and then you guys can countries with is that what I do countries with legalized

(50:48) prostitution legalized prostitution that would be corn with higher human

(50:53) trafficking in they have higher human trafficking inflow CL in countries where prostitution is prohibited the scale and

(50:59) effect of legalizing prostitution I.E the expansion of the market outweighs the substitution effect where legal sex

(51:06) workers are favored over legal workers this means that human trafficking increases if prostitution is legalized

(51:13) and if sex work is legalized cross the board human trafficking goes up but here's the other side effect that you

(51:18) won't talk about and this is what one of the things that you need to kind of answer to sure the fact is according to

() 

(51:25) this study that the is so saturated with pornography it makes it extremely hard

(51:30) uh to find the incidences of CP which exists that are uploaded to these sites

(51:36) that's child stuff okay yeah yeah it's estimated in 2003 that 20% of all

(51:42) pornography traded over the internet was that type of pornography that since 1997

(51:47) the number of child images like that are available on the internet had increased

(51:54) 1,500% 1500% which means right now by the way somewhere around 67% of males before age

(52:03) 15 have watched full hardcore corn on the internet somewhere around 37% of

(52:09) girls didn't you Andrew no didn't you the internet wasn't even around then what did you jerk off we jerk off to

(52:14) like Macy's catalogs the thing is the thing is if you're watching it you can

(52:19) be exploited by it that's why you have A500 1700% increase in the amount of

(52:24) child images which are now out for child porn we're not even going to like none of us here [ __ ] support

(52:30) that's I'm not saying you support it I'm saying that with the industry comes the entailment of this when we all discover our penis I

(52:38) mean to enjoy M we're all going to see oh [ __ ] what does this do oh that feels kind of cool

(52:45) we all do it even priests even nuns what does that have to do with anything my

(52:51) point is we're all jerking off so yeah guys that discovered porn on the Internet big deal I was jerking off I

(52:56) remember the Eminem Superman video had a titty flash I would pause it at 2 minutes 38 seconds and I wh to that every [ __ ] day all good if I had porn

(53:04) I would have just shift it to that that was my porn that doesn't change anything not answering to what I'm saying your

(53:10) argument if I can explain it to him is your argument the fact that this industry creates all this waste right

(53:18) this like this radioactive waste known as C the fact that it exists at all the fact that this yeah the fact that this

(53:24) industry exists and is promoted leads to a massive increase in miners consuming this type of

(53:31) material which then leads the exploitation of those same miners right I understand that but don't you think

(53:36) most a lot of things in our society comes with a lot of bad horrible

(53:45) [ __ ] right I suppose sure like sugar sure right

(53:50) mhm but well you're not out here lobbying to Outlaw Snickers and yeah it wouldn't be an outlying of Snickers be

(53:57) well so here's the thing most people don't develop a mental illness because they ate Snickers they develop mental

(54:03) illnesses though if they're on the set of porn of porn sites and they're getting banged when you're talking

(54:09) mental illness when you're talking about things which are just generally unhealthy for you human beings seem to

(54:14) be able to regulate their behaviors around these things some things are much more addictive than others for instance

(54:20) massive campaign from the government to reduce smoking they didn't have to Outlaw smoking they just did everything

(54:25) that they could to create a social stigma around it and the rates of it went like this down to almost nothing

(54:31) they did the same thing with obesity they have Pro uh if they do anything Pro Health that type of propaganda seems to

(54:37) work significantly well in the population you can do the exact same thing with pornography and sex work have

(54:42) huge amounts of propaganda saying this is really bad do anything but this even if you never made it illegal I got it

(54:50) let me ask you this this would not exist if not for men consuming it or women

(54:55) making it or men consuming or women making it where there's demand there's Market where there's Market there's demand it

() 

(55:02) is a100 billion doll a year industry and if this didn't exist guess what they would be brist and 30% of it is women

(55:08) consuming as well so the thing is is that the industry still would exist without men it might only be 40 billion

(55:16) instead of 100 billion how many women are paying I don't know how many they're paying they get the lots of them pay they get the free sh L of them pay to

(55:21) prend out on their but this is one of the worst arguments made by the kind of Pro corn side is that if men didn't

(55:28) exist this wouldn't exist yes it would just like if women weren't making it then there would still be gay porn I

(55:34) just don't understand the art you know my you know what Croc dealers say they say someone else is going to sell them

(55:41) Croc right is crack legal no if it was would more people sell it yeah argument defeated over to you no

(55:50) not that's a your argument oh you got destroyed oh no I disagree oh my god listen I disagree

(55:56) a market there is demand yeah but you just agreed that we can limit the market and the Demand right whether it's there

(56:01) or not it reduces the amount of consumers if on the other hand you're saying if we made porn illegal be would

(56:07) there be less porn of course you make anything illegal yes yeah no no [ __ ] yes but you can also create regulations

(56:13) around this you don't have are you okay with porn yeah please wait so wait wait

(56:18) just real quick are you okay with porn or you trying to say no porn yeah I would get rid of it all together so what are but even if but you're willing to be

(56:26) somewhere where so you trying to meet tell would probably be so I would say so

(56:32) here's what I would say I'd say you couldn't get rid of it tomorrow okay but you could do some things which would greatly regulate it for one right I'd

(56:40) say you need on the internet to upload some kind of photo ID in order to access these sites that way you can keep miners

(56:46) off of them period do you think that works cuz I'm as a 14-year-old can do whatever I want let me finish the

(56:51) solution and then you can criticize it that's fair right next I would up the age of which you can actually do this

(56:58) type of work from 18 to somewhere around 25 years old want to see a 25 old 27y

(57:04) old right I would definitely up the uh the ante of when a person could enter

(57:10) into a contract like this for the same reason that you can't go and rent a car until you're 25 years old there's a good

(57:17) reason for that it's because you don't really understand the contracts that you're entering into so this is a big

(57:24) problem can I apply that to religion this entire bullet points as well we shouldn't indoctrinate children into

(57:31) religion until they're 25 all you have to do is fify it like I just did with corn and then sure okay you know what I

(57:38) don't hate any of your points I actually don't you're are but your arguments have all your arguments have all been these

() 

(57:45) people are gross and this is gross not that hasn't been my argument I'm not I'm not mad at those points at all I want I

(57:51) want but but at what point in those did you say I don't want nine [ __ ] in the mouth cuz that was your original argument what I'm saying that that was

(57:58) distinct and it was going against something which was said back towards Brian about a cell phone incident when

(58:03) I'm talking about uh he thinks oh it's really mean that you yelled at an 18-year-old because her cell phone went

(58:09) off versus but I'll watch her get gangbanged by eight dudes even though that's going to leave massive

(58:14) ramification somehow I face [ __ ] my girlfriend and you yell at her I like

(58:20) yelling at a girl that I'm see you guys got to listen let me get the point out yell at a man show me how tough you are buddy boy oh yeah in instead of instead

(58:26) of eight men ganging on one that's that's some type of like Savage awesome

(58:31) Epic man I'm I'm standing for whatever a girl wants to do she does not want to be yelled at by a guy to be Cyber Bullied

(58:38) on then I'm then I don't support it she wants to go get [ __ ] by 40 dudes God bless her yeah so she can consent to go

(58:44) do that but not getting an argument God bless her yeah not getting an argument an argument too much but I mean if you

(58:50) fight with my girlfriend she's done horrible things in bed with me that these two don't equate right I face [ __ ]

(58:56) with my girlfriend but you are mean to her and public like yeah I'm going to be a dick back to you what is that yeah

(59:01) that's fair yeah but but you should expect the same thing from the religious to people who are exploiting uh women

(59:08) and exploiting men in the corn industry now the same thing should apply there the religion thing back to the religion

(59:14) if if you're saying because you do this thing to this person right and I have some emotional investment here I'm going

(59:20) to do something back well that's exactly what the religious are saying to you what do you mean they're saying we have an emotional investment in mankind and

(59:27) we're not going to let you exploit them that's what they're saying they're saying the exact same thing you are but they're exploiting you with the religion

(59:33) yeah that you discuss your body being a cup you're filling with sins but then you're like ah my sins are okay but I'm

(59:39) going to tell my daughter not to do that well you know what an analogy is right yeah I do yeah so great so I can make an analogy so you understand conceptually

(59:45) what I'm saying doesn't mean I'm giving you the physical reality yes I know that's not your soul let me tell you this let me tell you this I am pretty

(59:52) sure if you do look your last points were fine but when you say it's okay

(59:57) porn is legal block it then it creates an unsafe environment oh yeah that's the look what happens with your priests when

(1:00:04) you say they cannot masturbate or have sex my nobody say look what they do I don't know cuz my priest my priest can

(1:00:10) have sex and get married okay great yeah Catholic priests look what they do when when you block something he's not a

(1:00:15) Catholic I'm not a Catholic I don't know okay I don't know [ __ ] of a religion but you look at Catholic priests you blocked

(1:00:21) them from something now they're doing it in real [ __ ] up unsafe ways so wa wait wow that's block porn what a crazy good

(1:00:27) point you know what it really is this is a crazy good point for instance for instance you're right a Catholic priest

(1:00:34) is going to be probably 10 20 times higher than the average person when it comes to uh you know going after kids

(1:00:41) that way that's true yeah but teachers are about a 100 times more likely to do it in public schools where it's

(1:00:46) mandatory that you send your kids so I wasn't talking about teachers I'm talking about priests yeah just

(1:00:52) saying wait wait it's taboo hang on it's Tabo and both but here you're you're worried about priests whereas the

(1:00:59) Mandate is that you send your kids to public school their likelihood of getting assaulted there is way way

() 

(1:01:04) higher by the staff and teachers so not sure this is a great point for you great point because you is it really yeah much

(1:01:11) higher almost 100 times higher let's pull that up yeah regardless I'm okay to

(1:01:16) it I'm not saying only to it I'm saying when you put rules on things I feel like and this could be wrong I feel like all

(1:01:22) my friends wanted to smoke weed when it was buying it off drug dealers and then when Canada Legalize It ah weed's not my

(1:01:28) thing people want to do what they can so if you block porn it's just and I was smoking some bad [ __ ] I had some bad

(1:01:33) trips porn that could happen a porn and you're going to get sketchy [ __ ] weird dudes making girls do things they

(1:01:39) don't want there's no safe words or or regulations that's crazy so I guess we should get rid of stop signs stop lights

(1:01:44) traffic laws traffic or everything if you got a speed they want if there's a

(1:01:49) speed limit there then that's what you're going to do you're going to break it because the speed limit's there less

(1:01:55) yes I mean I do break speed Li on the autobond where Germany no speed limit and guess what less [ __ ] accidents

(1:02:02) Andrew got him the less accidents which happen happen in the autobond do you know why that is because men are driving

(1:02:10) cuz it's well yeah but but no do you know why that is do you think if they put a speed limit on the Auto Bond that

(1:02:16) suddenly there would be a bunch more accidents I don't know dude one could argue then argue it I don't know you

(1:02:23) don't know I don't know no one knows so I just want to make sure that we got this right there's a four-way cross

(1:02:29) right four ways you want to take the stop signs out of that right no I'm not

(1:02:35) saying that well I I'm saying no no no if the stop sign's there your impulse is going to be I'm not stopping for you

(1:02:41) mother is that you shouldn't cancel porn because it'll make it a shitty unsafe place and more bad [ __ ] will go wrong

(1:02:47) what's going to be worse than the exploitation of kids up to 1,500 times the rate of before we had porn legalized

() 

(1:02:54) what's going to be worse than that the the porn companies that are doing are have nothing to do with the kids

(1:03:00) nothing bro okay you're right the smoking companies have nothing to do with the cancer right I I don't think you just

(1:03:06) wake up one day and want to like you think a big porn company I'm not going to Tiny names in the same sentence but a

(1:03:11) big one has anything to do with child porn they don't at all bro they're regulating [ __ ] like a corporate

(1:03:17) business don't don't say don't say that word the child this because of YouTube I don't mind the words I love getting into

(1:03:23) it got it CP CP C even say that just say CD so anyway who said CP yeah yeah I did

(1:03:30) you're right but anyways so back to this just so you understand um what you're

(1:03:35) saying would be the equivalent of me saying tobacco chated $100 you guys argue like the of bimbos

(1:03:42) that come on making valid points and nervously laugh when making them and then look at each other for affirmation

(1:03:48) and support while gigling at each other cringe I can't get a word in you guys are just talk I barely talk either I'm

(1:03:56) going to have a smoke I'll let you go well I want to have a smoke okay smoke and dip that's a sin man yeah that is a

(1:04:02) sin it's not a sin it isn't well we'll get into it as soon as he what about the shot we did before the show not a okay

(1:04:08) Andrew is there is Molly Molly there all right

() 

(1:04:14) guys Andrew's going on a brief smoke briak he'll be back just momentarily uh Nick why don't you pull up the stats

(1:04:20) really quick cuz we mentioned it earlier uh I saw you guys texting and and that's that's another texting it's

(1:04:28) another bonus that we don't have what him and I what what are you and I going they have their call a friend they have

(1:04:33) their ask the audience hold on so hold on hold on hold on um so this is uh for

(1:04:39) our most recent we've done uh I think this is from 181 episodes of ours we've

(1:04:45) done 185 so the percentage is about 20%

(1:04:51) uh about 20% sex workers 80% quote unquote normal women on the show so the

(1:04:56) majority of the women we have on the show are normal nonsex workers civilian they

(1:05:03) which without which of your Clips are the most viral honestly the ones without sex workers some of our most viral

(1:05:10) moments not a sex work we granted we we have had viral moments with sex maybe

(1:05:15) that's my algorithm then it it certainly could be Nick we're going to pull up the Super Chat all right we have Nathaniel

(1:05:22) cook you say that you shouldn't yell at an 18-year-old because she's young SL little girl yet you would F an

(1:05:28) 18-year-old would you say that you are effing okay well that last part yeah

(1:05:33) yeah that's a little much yeah but I mean it I think in one of your uh maybe

(1:05:39) Instagram stories Ryan you said something along the lines of this 40-year-old by the way we're like the same

(1:05:45) age almost yeah I'm The 40-Year-Old uh something like he brings on these 18

(1:05:50) 19yearold girls and he just he just yell disrespect respects them but it's

(1:05:58) like I will certainly concede that occasionally I will get flustered or

(1:06:03) frustrated or sometimes lose my cool and I'll get frustrated girl be like what the [ __ ] you know whatever it is

(1:06:11) but I would assume you're totally fine with 18-year-old women doing like hardcore

(1:06:17) porn I don't know I think it's a little young to start and the ad the advice

(1:06:22) that the the veterans do give 18 19 20 old girls is wait a bit maybe you're a

(1:06:28) little young to start and and I I back that right but you can't be mad at someone for using the law to their

(1:06:34) advantage right like if you can buy cigarettes at 18 you're going to go do it sure yeah they can do it like do I

(1:06:41) think 18-year-olds are gross yes I don't think they should jump in that young to be honest fair enough I did want to talk

(1:06:47) to you guys uh so Ryan you have a lot of these only fans girls on their shows um

() 

(1:06:53) I think this goes beyond this this is actually one of my big criticisms that

(1:06:58) uh not of you but this and well you do you have an only fans I think you might

(1:07:04) but I don't if you post anything yeah so Pillow Talk does we've posted six clips and it's where I have them [ __ ] on the

(1:07:10) show but you're not you're not in any of the videos correct no I sit there and I interview them while they [ __ ] okay I

(1:07:17) think I saw a clip on your Twitter so you just in the corner yeah yeah yeah yeah any in any case if people are going

(1:07:23) to hate on me they call me a [ __ ] EAS thing to say one of I guess the criticisms I've had that not well like

(1:07:29) wait what did just watch the if you Google what a cuck means it's you like watch your wife get [ __ ] that wouldn't be yeah that would it's just it's just

(1:07:37) odd yeah definitely but do you commentate do you do color commentary like NFL like while there yeah so what

(1:07:44) do you yeah I do How does it go so we've done it we've done it five times

(1:07:49) now no but remember so our most viral episode so really what Pillow Talk is

(1:07:54) it's kind of bringing mainstream comedy you know barstol of rated R so of porn industry

(1:08:01) so it's comedy fun sex positive have fun it's it's it's a comedy show right every

(1:08:07) now and then I like to shock the world and go a little viral so our most viral episode is we had this guy Jake Marshall

(1:08:13) at stage four cancer begging me to meet his two dream porn stars Kazumi Nikki Ben so I flew him down to be on the show

(1:08:19) and meet them it was his dying wish and we surprised him with a [ __ ]

(1:08:24) threesome where they [ __ ] him on the show did he best day of his life then we

(1:08:30) sold that I told him I'd split the money with him 50/50 sell it on only fans $15 to see the whole episode went crazy did

(1:08:36) very well that money got him into special Intensive Care Unit saved his [ __ ] life and got rid of the

(1:08:42) cancer dude God true story um so I'm not mad at that one thing I did want to get

(1:08:50) in when it came to uh only fans so let's even just you want to F two porn stars to save cancer no or you would just pray

(1:08:58) no mind you hold on hold on wouldn't [ __ ] two porn stars ever uh sooss let's

(1:09:03) just put aside the criticisms of the actual think Indian food's gross so let's put aside the criticisms of the

(1:09:09) actual nudity and stuff uh one thing a lot of only fans girls are engaged in is

(1:09:15) so one component of only fans and I'm not really an expert in it but I've heard from girls themselves is they

(1:09:23) offer essentially and I think the way they maybe they get it through tips or they charge for chats for messaging to

() 

(1:09:30) be able to message the girls the guys have to pay them money and the girls

(1:09:35) represent that it's them like the girl talking I hear to the guy I I see where

(1:09:42) you're going and so and what's actually happen wait wait wait wait hold on I don't like to promote that part of it

(1:09:48) cuz it [ __ ] blocks my girls bag well so and I as a CT we talk about it we can talk about yeah so actually as a

(1:09:54) courtesy those guys are actually gay hold on hold on hold on let me just make my point so

(1:10:00) as a courtesy a lot of the time I will actually since they're coming on because

(1:10:05) I don't want to like unless they're super rude I'll I'll refrain from bringing up this criticism of only fans

(1:10:11) just so whatever but but so they have what's called typers in chat or Chatters

(1:10:16) where it's not them who's chatting not the girl specifically who's chatting to the men but it's some guy in the a male

(1:10:22) typically I know you're talking about it's a hold on it's it's a male in the Philippines who's pretending to be her

(1:10:29) but these girls but these girls are representing are saying you're talking

(1:10:34) to me bro women lie sure but hold on hold on but so when you're I'm not

(1:10:41) tweeting at Wendy when I'm tweeting at Wendy's no you know what I mean like I'm just hold on let me make my argument so

(1:10:48) when you're advertising a product and if you're saying you can talk to me I'm the

(1:10:54) one talking to you and you're charging money for it uh this is actually fraud

(1:10:59) it's fraudulent to say you're talking to me but it's some dude in the Philippines in fact you're basically like forcing

(1:11:06) that dude to be kind of gay I don't know if it's gay like if he he's sexting your

(1:11:11) point I get your point but it's a butt you're non-consensually making him gay yeah but

(1:11:17) you're looking at sex work a sex work and not that as a business and that's just delegating some responsibil I hear

(1:11:23) your point and it's a good one you rais a good point there the 16 Chapel wasn't painted by Michelangelo alone right he

(1:11:29) had assistance and that's what these only fans Chatters are they're helping me fulfill my dream of [ __ ] living on

(1:11:35) an island making a year you know what I really think sure what do you think I don't think they care the guys I don't

(1:11:40) think they [ __ ] cuz they're just getting the content to whack off they know if a documentary came out exposing this I bet

(1:11:46) the numbers wouldn't [ __ ] change and the guys are still there chatting this is why AI is coming out they and it's

(1:11:52) blowing up I didn't think it was going to work I was like no they want to talk they think they're talking to Angela White when they're not no no no they

(1:11:59) don't [ __ ] care they want to jerk off and be sexting who they think is them they probably deep down no they don't

(1:12:05) have time to answer a bilon people there's enough mentally ill men who are like I don't care long day talk to a fake girl so

(1:12:14) well there's two things here so yes there are the men who they subscribe to the only fans and they mostly care about

(1:12:19) the images and maybe the talking the chatting is secondary to them and they whatever it's some [ __ ] bot robot

(1:12:27) assistant person third party fer in the Philippines but then I would argue I I

(1:12:33) would say most of the men that are subscribing to the only fans and part of there's this sort of uh I don't know if

(1:12:39) it's parasocial but they they're almost selling this girlfriend experience too and then that's when these girls are

(1:12:45) going to uh sort of um oh I'm single I'm

(1:12:50) I'm actually romantically interested in you continue financially supporting me in me and at the end of the rainbow

(1:12:57) potentially there's a chance to be in a relationship with these girls of course this is never the case they typically

(1:13:03) have boyfriends which they hide uh but speaking strictly on the whole chatter typer thing I would say most of these

(1:13:10) men are naive they don't know and so if they do believe that if you're selling a

(1:13:15) service you can talk to me but it's actually some person being paid minimum

(1:13:20) wage in uh what whatever it is you think Bieber runs his own Twitter

(1:13:26) TW back it's the same thing they don't [ __ ] care Bieber tweeted me they want

(1:13:31) to believe it they want to believe it well I'll even then I'll make the same claim for Justin Bieber if he's advertising that he's you can speak

(1:13:37) directly to me and if you subscribe to my Twitter then yes if but if he's saying you can speak with me you if

(1:13:44) that's fraud yeah sure so is the full self drive from Tesla fraud is all around us why do we care that a bunch of

(1:13:50) [ __ ] losers are being scammed out of their money over naked photos do you really care about those people photos is

(1:13:55) one thing but the conversation I bet if this came out people are just lonely lonely I bet I bet you'd be surprised

(1:14:03) how little they [ __ ] care I bet so you don't have any objections to I don't care because being separated from his

(1:14:09) money I see what you're saying and capitalism there's there's a there's an ethical line on it because you could

(1:14:15) argue some of them do push it to the come chat with me bro the hot girl is not going to [ __ ] me cuz I drink a Bud

(1:14:20) Light irregardless of what their [ __ ] commercial says but why these guys giving them money for it if you're buying pictures sure but to just send

(1:14:27) money 800 bucks to a girl you think she's G you think she's gonna [ __ ] you bro no I'm not saying dud you don't

(1:14:32) honestly like realistically in everything that goes on in the world in terms of capitalism and making money you

(1:14:39) don't really give a [ __ ] that these dudes are being scammed out of a dollar at a time you really do yes of course so

(1:14:45) but I object to the other ways in the world in which people are getting scammed or [ __ ] over too now I see

(1:14:51) your stance on that and I'm not going to argue that it's good that they're doing this but I actually Auto I don't think

(1:14:56) the guys would give a [ __ ] that's maximizing your [ __ ] that's all these guys are doing these girls are like I

(1:15:02) work hard so look even fine with the nudity they can still do it but I think

(1:15:08) misrepresenting you know come in the champagne room find out if I'm going to [ __ ] you I don't [ __ ] the champ room own

(1:15:15) own worldview your world view is you're [ __ ] delusional you pray to the sky daddy who doesn't exist but if you want

(1:15:22) the delusion of chatting with somebody who doesn't exist on the other end that's fine as long as I can make some

(1:15:27) [ __ ] money however if the religious are pushing that that's bad because it's what but I'm not arguing that against

(1:15:34) you I didn't come in here attacking religion I was just saying that both you said it's literally mental illness yes

(1:15:40) it is okay well then how's that not an attack but isn't that an attack but that's just my opinion I don't [ __ ] stand on attack whether whether it's op

(1:15:47) sorry for attacking you well you're not attacking me you're attacking the religion though right but you don't have to wear so I'm attacking the idea that

(1:15:54) this fraud is fine because you having to make is also fraud give money and then you'll get into heaven Rel has tons of

(1:16:00) fraud there's no fraud in religion of course there and it's all wrong all fraud and Rel why are you part of it

(1:16:07) because I don't believe that all churches are fraudulent that they have believe they have an epistemic belief

(1:16:15) all sex workers are great but you are defending this you

(1:16:20) say this is fine this fraud is fine there's nothing wrong with it cuz it makes you money that's capital because

(1:16:26) there's no harm delusion there's no one's being harmed there there is people objective not only are there objectively

(1:16:32) victims here of this fraud which would be a the guy who thinks he's having this par of social relationship with this

(1:16:38) chick but then two this woman elicit getting the money this way it's even harmful to her there's two victims you

(1:16:45) victimize yourself every time I had to get laid right that's we both it's a dance it's a dance we both are lying if

(1:16:53) you are delusional if you think every lying to get laid when you're [ __ ] 19 and trying to go to a bar you're lying

(1:16:59) about how nice your this is my car not my parents right like you're literally doing everything you can to get to your

(1:17:05) goal do you I mean when you were 25 were you lying to get laid

(1:17:11) probably up probably what's the well who cares well I mean I would think that

(1:17:16) women would care I I'm not lying like hey you know I'm lying like hey it's 12 in that's my li hang on so then just get

(1:17:22) this right let's say you wake up in the morning yeah all right and uh you take off the

(1:17:28) pants of the girl who's next to you and there's a penis there cuz it was a transgender person bro you think if I went to bed and didn't suck that dick

() 

(1:17:34) the night before I would know that there's a penis M right would you feel like you were defrauded if a if a if a

(1:17:40) woman took you home and you took off their pants and there was a penis would that be frog uh I would blame myself for

(1:17:46) not checking it's your fault it is it's not that they had nothing to do with it yeah they weren't misrepresenting

(1:17:51) themselves they weren't doing any of that m probably yeah probably and he would say

(1:17:58) hey uh you shouldn't be [ __ ] doing that that's totally wrong right transgenders should disclose I have a

(1:18:05) dick by the way I know that you think I'm a woman but I have a penis they why because otherwise it's

(1:18:11) fraud because otherwise you're being dishonest and you're you are taking advantage of another person I think

(1:18:17) that's actually meeting someone in person is a lot different than just having I know a girl that gave a guy a [ __ ] he played on the Blue Jays and

(1:18:24) she gave him a [ __ ] in the bathroom at a bar we were all at at a sports bar and she ran out and said I just sucked his dick and I have a dick and that's

(1:18:31) not cool no it's not cuz he thought it was a woman yeah s seems like seems like misrepresenting that sounds like assault

(1:18:37) yes exactly sounds like misrepresenting yourself and fraud can do some serious damage like lying to a I would argue

(1:18:42) that lying to a woman in order to bet her would also that would be taking advantage of her how's an ugly guy like

(1:18:48) me supposed to get laid bro I guess with some honesty I guess with some honesty you

(1:18:54) got status I gotta let yeah you got a good following you got your own company brand you make good money sure sure but

(1:19:00) we all lie to each other every [ __ ] day that doesn't mean wear makeup doesn't mean she's face tuning photos

(1:19:06) I'm lying about how much money I have but you there are there are what

(1:19:13) come on dude you just what you're lying to your girl about how much money you have not my girlfriend I'm saying when I

(1:19:18) was when you're he's just joking around I'm just I'm just saying there's a difference between waking up with

(1:19:24) someone and having sexual intercourse and being defrauded that way versus faceless DMS right it's like I don't

(1:19:29) freak out if I'm catfish saying what I'm saying the the logic of the two positions is being catfished you're

(1:19:35) being catfished in both scenarios you're it's being Mis has a less smaller victim one has almost no victim they still

(1:19:42) victims in both who cares yeah I care the same reason you do about

(1:19:49) the truth should be considered sexual assault guy in the hat looks like he do

(1:19:55) shower yes these people are funny love back to this just like just like your

(1:20:01) logic is thank you whatever just like your logic is that's assault that's sexual assault should have disclosed it

(1:20:06) totally lying in order to defraud somebody for some type of sexual gratification it's the same [ __ ]

(1:20:11) thing tell me how it's not you you know what I can't wait to see when it does get exposed that there are Chatters how

(1:20:17) the money and how the economy of only fans stays exact [ __ ] same and that's all there us to know about it yeah but

(1:20:23) you're that's all there to know you're not answering to the question though how's it not fraud the same way it would be when the dude runs out and goes I'm a

(1:20:30) dude just suck this guy off he didn't know I was would you agree celebrity no celebrity has time to manage their

(1:20:35) message let me ask you they don't have time would you agree that there's degrees of fraud waking up with someone

() 

(1:20:42) or just being like someone just milked me for $100 yeah I agree right and that's it I got to leave you in the trenches I've had eight Waters I got PE

(1:20:48) but you still got to agree with me that even ifas my even if there agrees to it it's still all bad I'm not disagreeing

(1:20:54) with you and if it's all bad get all but like to me I'm like harmless victims just a bunch of bros who got defrauded

(1:21:01) it happens with crypto happens [ __ ] W away the fact that many of these women will suck will sucker these guys in for

(1:21:07) their entire life savings and sometimes it's not even well can I ask you a question though dude like you you're

(1:21:13) obviously an intelligent human being would you ever find yourself in a position to be sending your life savings

(1:21:20) to a woman at that point you would look at that that guy's the clown in that situation don't know you're like you're a little bit but I also understand that

(1:21:27) I was born with a symmetrical shape right that when I was in my my younger years especially I was a very handsome

(1:21:32) guy we pull phot it was very easy pull the photo it was very easy for me to have no it was very easy for me to have

(1:21:39) relationships with women there's many many men who I talk to all over the world who are intelligent but they fall

(1:21:46) for these delusions because that a porn star wants to date them bro that's like me being like Scarlett Johansson's been

(1:21:51) texting me all week the thing is is that through through vert

(1:22:01) propagandize spent his life savings on an only fans girl You' be like bro what are you a [ __ ] no okay but I've seen

(1:22:07) I've seen very intelligent men I've seen very intelligent men spend their entire life savings on a bad woman they end up

(1:22:13) marrying too so that's it the thing is though is that that's not their fault that that

(1:22:20) happened $100 I've had sex with 4 50 plus women

(1:22:25) and I've never had to lie once you can do it without fraud if you're going to

(1:22:30) pay you might as well do it in person I'm not a saint but I'm also not a s

(1:22:36) yeah thank you L Paladin good to see I love when a guy brags about I thought it was like 500 last

(1:22:42) show what happened oh he said 450 plus oh 450 women 50 dudes there no plus yeah

(1:22:48) he said plus okay yeah plus do you know these guys at this point pretty much yeah I've done like camping with a

() 

(1:22:53) couple of them are they weird do you find it weird that dudes tip you do I find it do you feel like a [ __ ] no I

(1:22:59) don't think it's weird for people to pay for good entertainment patronage patronage yeah like I go watch movies I don't find that weird and that's why

(1:23:05) guys p on only cuz they're getting entertained yeah dud so they're going to be types of entertainment which are

(1:23:11) terrible for you like for instance if we had a gladiatorial ring where dudes had [ __ ] Gladius they hacked each other

(1:23:18) to Pieces I'm sure that that would be entertaining but it would also be barbaric brutal it be bad for you to

(1:23:23) watch it it would to it it would lead to mass exploitation it would lead to probably a new form of

(1:23:29) slavery it would be [ __ ] awful so what are the bad points I feel like well done well done

(1:23:37) the trolling almost got me a little bit I mean if if you were in charge of the country it would just be a little bit

(1:23:43) [ __ ] boring you know you would probably cancel UFC you would probably

(1:23:48) cancel commercial litigation lawyer hearing these guys view on Commercial

(1:23:53) fraud has me very curious how by the books their Kum operation is run I assume your council is blowing up your

() 

(1:24:00) phone Lau yes my lawyers texted me right now I almost wonder I almost there's

(1:24:05) like if it could be a clash class action lawsuit kuming gooning it's all oh I'm

(1:24:10) not disagreeing with you like if they get clipped fine but like I don't feel for these these aren't victims to me to

(1:24:16) me of all the [ __ ] that happens in the world a bunch of dudes being scammed out of a bunch of money over like them

(1:24:21) thinking they're dating [ __ ] uh Sky Bri like bro there there's a documentary coming out

(1:24:28) they say it's going on Hulu maybe not I hope it is but anyways it's called simps actually MH and are you going to be on

(1:24:41) donated $15 hey fellas great episode so far I

(1:24:46) like the strong difference in ideas robust arguments on both sides funny too

(1:24:53) Andrew solid K with good rebuttal firing on all complimenting you that's why I just fed

(1:25:00) him I saidy firing on all Cinders well the viewership so should I get some of that tip cuz I'm mentioned I'm a Jew

(1:25:06) come on bro hey what the you said don't say that you said it what their docs about is they brought

(1:25:14) up all these guys in cases have hand sanitizer over I'm kidding I'm kidding go ahead

(1:25:19) where where they're spending more than 80% of their in come on only fans and I think that's not the

(1:25:26) girls problem these guys are [ __ ] idiots if you are living in your mom's basement making 40K you're spending 35

(1:25:33) $100 what WR with there is worse ways to spend money than on on Lans you could

(1:25:38) spend it on repackaged cheap Chinese shirts from [ __ ] live forever love it this great from papular New

(1:25:46) Guinea that was good so I just want to make sure I just want to make sure that what you're saying the entailment of

(1:25:52) this [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] take people they're not that smart but doesn't

(1:25:58) religion generally take advantage of simple-minded people considering the smartest people that I've ever met are

(1:26:03) religious and the dumbest are not just saying I mean I'm just saying

(1:26:10) there's just hard like I don't want to talk religion cuz we w we won't convince each other right like there's no

(1:26:16) argument here and there's no reason to I don't even use religious arguments but what I do do is explain I'm going to

(1:26:22) express that there's no Christian faith nor Jewish faith by the way that I'm aware of that would ever say that it was

(1:26:29) okay to take advantage of men or women because you're low IQ that'd be like me saying oh yeah I [ __ ] her I [ __ ] her

(1:26:36) you know why let's not have You Met My People we literally would take advantage of anyone for a dollar I just wanted hey

(1:26:42) let's not go there I just wanted to I just wanted to bring it out but anyway so back to this back to this that would

(1:26:48) be like me saying yeah I take advantage of low IQ women donated $100 I enjoy watching Andrew verly

(1:26:55) Slaughter fools like you on this podcast it's more exciting than some on lean's

(1:27:00) fakery you made a bad assumption paying for it once doesn't mean you always pay

(1:27:06) right so the the entailment here imagine if I said yeah I only [ __ ] low IQ women

(1:27:11) who are stupid that I can take advantage of would you say that that was immoral I see what you're saying and I

(1:27:17) don't like the way you're comparing it that's nice would you say that's imoral because I don't like the way you're comparing would you say it's immoral

(1:27:22) though I don't like the way you're comparing I don't like the way you're not answering would you say that's immoral if you only [ __ ] stupid girls I

(1:27:28) only [ __ ] stupid girls who are low IQ but you know what they love it they love it they think it's great it's fantastic

(1:27:36) St that's all you can do okay there's a difference between stupid people and is it immoral to do that wait wait wait but

(1:27:42) there's is it immoral to only F how stupid are we talking just under under average I if they're mentally

(1:27:47) hand PSA donated $100 I donate to whatever but I would

(1:27:53) not pay to what the My Little Pony movie good entertainment has a value quality

(1:27:59) education lint roll for the win okay so real question apprciate if we're

(1:28:05) excluding people who have actual mental deficiencies right which is do you know what the mental illness rate is in women

(1:28:12) I'm talking you're saying just dumb like just dumb yeah there's nothing wrong

(1:28:17) with [ __ ] a dumb girl there's nothing wrong with [ __ ] a dumb guy yeah so right that's not taking advantage of them they dumb so your idea is here yes

(1:28:24) that if you have a low IQ right that I'm not IQ testing these girls I I get it

(1:28:30) but you can't make specific exploitative systems which go towards people who have lower IQs which are exploitative systems

(1:28:37) entire country is founded on taking advantage of dumb people all we do even even literally all we do even if that

(1:28:42) was true why would it make it right SE with even if that was true why would it be right because not everything is like

(1:28:49) right it's you can have wrong things in the world you can have wrong things in the world they shouldn't be correcting

(1:28:54) wrong things in the world right you shouldn't be you shouldn't be assisting them you're not like oh we got a fire and it's burning everything down let's

() 

(1:29:00) go pour gasoline on it that's [ __ ] insane so that dumb people shouldn't [ __ ] no what I'm saying is that you should not create systems which take

(1:29:07) advantage of people the same way that if I said look I only go for like half [ __ ] chicks take you would be like

(1:29:14) that's horrible I've never heard anyone say that good point I only exploit prostitutes that are addicted to heroin

(1:29:21) but it's not immoral because reasons yeah yeah sure they they have tons of addiction problem many of D how's he a

(1:29:29) sick [ __ ] go he goes after heroin addicts F the girls who go on your

(1:29:35) podcast I've listened to many of your interviews they talk about all of the drugs that they've been that they've abused they talk about the drug issues

(1:29:41) that they've had how it's rampant in that industry they talk about it many many times many other women though drug

(1:29:47) not as many as other women n but sure and and I'll tell you I know a lot of chefs that are [ __ ] degenerates too a

(1:29:54) Jesus Robert Tanner donated $100 these two individuals have what's

(1:30:00) called cognitive dissonance Andrew and Brian can you please explain what that it is to them slavery is an example what

(1:30:08) what does that mean cognitive dissonance just means that you have a position which is untenable but you refuse to

(1:30:13) abandon it because you're emotionally invested in it and once you have to focus on it it's very uncomfortable oh

(1:30:19) I'm get very uncomfortable no I think I think we're also but I think you're doing a lot of

(1:30:25) phrases about the same thing like degrees of fraud are not the same thing as fraud fraud right like will toed but

(1:30:33) I'm willing I conceded that point right and dude and the concession to the concession to the point though if I say

(1:30:40) there's there's stealing a100 million is a way worse form of fraud than a 100 I'm

(1:30:45) still going to say stealing the hundred is [ __ ] wrong and needs to be outlawed just like the 100 million right

(1:30:50) yeah Am I Wrong sure okay well then I don't know what what my AR but my argument is I don't care about those

(1:30:59) people oh you don't care so that solves the problem cuz you don't care no cuz there's no problem to me I'm like men are going to get scammed by women cuz

() 

(1:31:05) men think with their dick dude and I think maybe that's where we that's our stance is that we wake up happy every

(1:31:11) day make your bag baby let's have fun you care and that's great but I don't even think these guys care as much as

(1:31:17) you do if they found out wait a second that was that was sharid deville's

(1:31:22) chatter the whole time how could you demonstrate that other than I just feel like I can't wait to

(1:31:27) see what happens cuz I don't think anyone's going to give a why are they giving Millions to AI That's [ __ ]

(1:31:33) crazy to me so again you can take what is called the loneliness epidemic which is going on inside of the United States

(1:31:39) in most western Nations called herbivore ISM in Japan this started a long long time ago that yes men who have a primary

(1:31:47) Edict of reproduction okay it's called herbivore ISM in ja they call them herbivores

(1:31:54) is that a vegan anim they they're not calling them that there for it's their version of soy

(1:31:59) boy yeah it's their version no it's just their version of mtow they checked out okay right they're done they're done

(1:32:04) with women they're done with this whatever I can't wait if you if you associate loneliness right we are tribal

(1:32:11) by Nature what you can do is you can break people's barriers down their emotional barriers and then take advantage of them isolation like what we

(1:32:18) had during and I I saw your take on uh the lockdowns I thought it was a fairly good take

(1:32:24) right where well I think this was you where you were like man I I was pretty antiva right was that you or was that

(1:32:31) you I don't remember which one I wasn't a VX guy at all yeah so I told you my stance on the what we same right so the

(1:32:38) thing is is that because of this isolation which happened you did see an explosion remember that uh PornHub these

(1:32:45) other places took advantage of this and said we're going to give you free entry right we're going to give you free entry

(1:32:50) these guys are lonely that now they're not communicating now they're stuck at at home yes it's taking advantage of

(1:32:55) people you can break down barriers you can run what are called psychological operations to do this they've been done

(1:33:01) for the last 200 years in the United States I'm sure that you guys know that this is an actual thing and yeah you can

(1:33:08) you can push down barriers of men to go towards these horrific things uh by

(1:33:14) isolation and through propaganda and that's exactly what's going on here this is not good for anybody it's not good

(1:33:20) for the girls it's not good for the [ __ ] John it's not good for any of them if you eliminated it tomorrow you

(1:33:25) tell me what the problems would be tell me what the problems would be eliminated what if you eliminated corn only fans

(1:33:31) all of it tomorrow if you had a magic wand oh yeah of course hang on hang on I snapped it it's all gone what are the

(1:33:36) problems I don't know so the problems would be that like selling illegal crack

(1:33:41) or or or selling illegal weed or legal shrooms is [ __ ] people up when when it's not regulated or safe or an

(1:33:49) environment the problem isn't to eliminate it it's how do we make it safer well then how come we have these

(1:33:54) nations where they do have legalized prostitution for instance we still see the human trafficking it just reggi the

(1:34:00) stats go through the roof versus the Nations which make it across the board illegal the United Nations looked at

(1:34:06) this issue the United Nations went okay the amount of trafficking that we see in Nations where we have legalized

(1:34:12) prostitutions through the [ __ ] roof they even made a recommendation that such sex work is not only not liberating

(1:34:19) to women but exploitative and the reason that they thought so was because of the human trafficking and under age element

(1:34:24) which always seemed to creep its way in Pre corn in the United States these issues were not present they were not

(1:34:32) there meaning where was the big issue in the 1950s what was it what were the what

(1:34:38) was the thing in the 19 there was no internet yeah there was yeah there was no access all corn off the internet

(1:34:44) tomorrow with a SN snap of the finger most people would not have access to it most people would not have even access to an ISP if the cable company didn't

(1:34:52) give them one you know it would be interesting to see what happens what do you think would happen I we're too dumb to tell you who knows negative

(1:34:58) ramifications or I don't know it could go one or two ways it could go one or two ways I don't know what the negative

(1:35:04) it could be a great thing it could be could be like the bees dude you don't want to get rid of the bees okay so let's not get rid of porn who knows what

(1:35:10) happen it could there is a chance that it could go really bad because okay what does that look like now they're

(1:35:16) producing it themselves it's these [ __ ] up unsafe places they're not getting tested and it's all underground

() 

(1:35:21) it's all underground it's on the dark web yeah and so it's greatly reduces this issue down to a very manageable

(1:35:28) issue yeah but this issue isn't really causing that many problems it's causing a lot of problems I just went over many

(1:35:33) many of them talking about like the CP and all that [ __ ] not just that that's just one aspect of it he brings up the

(1:35:38) the interest of fraud you also have what are legalized pimps who basically will move after these underage girls uh to

(1:35:46) kind of Groom them into that industry by the time they turn 18 so all the problems are illegal all those pimps

(1:35:52) will just Ops right just want to make it saf or make them legal pimps and then it's [ __ ] safe and fine well the my

(1:35:58) stance on prostitution is not the same as porn at all that's because you create this differential that does not need to

(1:36:04) exist which is if that camera is on me while I'm doing a sex act then it's not

(1:36:09) prostitution if I'm getting paid that makes no [ __ ] sense and I need you to square that for me no problem totally

() 

(1:36:15) goad okay here's the difference all right I was actually talking to a porn star a male porn star has been doing 25

(1:36:21) years and he's married to another female porn star yeah he her Sho sheo they're cool with it he will not let her escort

(1:36:28) he will not let her go in a hotel room with a guy and he says when she's shooting for browsers MH it's seven

(1:36:35) eight people on set it's very professional they come on hair and makeup they sign all these things they

(1:36:40) talk there's no lists and we're going to do this they break down the scene all this and that it's scripted perfectly of

(1:36:46) how they want it and then really I've been on porn sets it's not really [ __ ] man it's okay now dude this now

(1:36:53) do that great all right cool good day when you're in a hotel room with this [ __ ] freaky old man that you don't

(1:36:58) know anything about and you got to do whatever he says to get your money from him at the end of it a whole different

(1:37:04) ball game yeah that really doesn't explain how the exchange of money for sex with camera and added people makes

(1:37:12) this not prostitution what is your definition of prostitution it would be the exchange of sexual intercourse or sexual favors for money well if you call

(1:37:18) it that sure but we're talking about hang on hang on hang on what would your definition of it be my of prostitution

(1:37:24) is look there's two terms right when we discuss prostitution regularly yes it's

(1:37:30) someone selling their you know [ __ ] for money or dick for money right right but

(1:37:35) the general prostitution of like yeah we all kind of exploit our bodies one way or another yeah you don't see my dick in

(1:37:41) everyday life because who wants to see it but like my body's been exploited my parents' bodies have been exploited

(1:37:47) right they've sold their bodies to corporations my mom's worked 50 hours a

(1:37:53) have to do with sex I'm just saying it's a form of prostitution she sold her body no no no I so if that was the case then

(1:38:00) you would consider everything prostitution if that's the case I'm a [ __ ] right now I'm here I'm literally a

(1:38:06) prostitute actually I'm not I'm an intern because you won't give me that's the case if that's the case then we can't categorize anything as

(1:38:12) prostitution exactly because you're ring the term too muchang right if everything's prostitution then nothing

(1:38:18) thank you we Le we're good let's go yeah that would be that would just mean your definition is meaningless so the

(1:38:23) definition which would actually point to the category of the thing so like if everything's a cup nothing's a cup right

(1:38:29) we have no category for cup we do need to have a category for cup otherwise we can't identify what a cup is we need to

(1:38:35) have a category for what a prostitute is or we can't identify what a prostitute saying sex for money is prostitution

(1:38:41) yeah yeah that's okay but I'm C can you give me a different definition than that that makes more sense I mean I'm

(1:38:47) categorized it differently I look at prostitution as what about you're sneaking around trading sex for money

(1:38:53) from matter if it was then what is legal prostition it's who's paying you is it the corporate company or is it the guy

(1:38:59) that's [ __ ] you in his hotel that's the difference for me so if you had like a ranch like a Vegas Ranch where the guy

(1:39:05) went in negotiated the rate with your corporate pimp and then went in the room and slept with you and then just went

(1:39:11) and go paid your corporate pimp on the way out that's not prostitution that's some something else let me ask you this

(1:39:17) no no answer my question before you ask me one answer one if one before you ask one okay can you repeat the question

(1:39:23) yeah the question is so if you went in and you paid a corporate pimp who took you to the back room so you could screw

(1:39:30) the the corporate prostitute yeah and then you left how's that not a prostitute under your definition here no

(1:39:37) that is that's a br a what is the distinction here well I'm I'm confused

(1:39:42) about what the argu what we're arguing like what I'm arguing is I want to know what a prostitute actually is and why my

(1:39:48) definition of exchange is sex or sexual favors for money so let me ask you be

(1:39:53) your better definition so let me ask you this let's say my girlfriend and I start an only fans during the pandemic and we

(1:40:00) start [ __ ] each other yeah are we each other's prostitutes in your eyes now because we're [ __ ] for money you would be prostitutes to the Johns who

(1:40:06) were watching sure but why are we afraid why why are we afraid of that word why can't

(1:40:12) we just call it that yeah why can't that's what you want to call it I'm fine I'm fine with your [ __ ] my girlfriend

(1:40:18) and dud want to watch not my girl is not a hooker she's my girlfriend and we're [ __ ] at the end of the day right to wait

(1:40:26) but John's are paying you for this sex act I'm [ __ ] my girl we're putting on and they're paying us yeah so John's are

(1:40:32) paying you for a sex act so you would be if you want to call it that prostitutes yeah you you really think

(1:40:39) but why is that but why is that offensive yeah that's not offensive that's what you want to call I don't care if you call me a prostitute if I'm

(1:40:45) acting like a prostitute agreed but we need to know what that is so we could say you are that's fine I have no

(1:40:51) problem telling a only fans girl that she's a prostitute great neither do I so then so then anytime I do the idea that

(1:40:59) any of these corn stars go [ __ ] crazy about it go no they're not because it comes up from a it comes

(1:41:06) more condescending right when I call her a prostitute it's the tone it's the tongue the when you think of it I call

(1:41:12) my friends like yo look at this [ __ ] hooker ter hooker or prostitute or [ __ ]

(1:41:17) even you think of a girl on the street waiting for a car to drive by to [ __ ] you think of that that's what we what we all how we were trained do you think

(1:41:24) that that's what Muslims think what do Muslims think do you think I'm asking you do you think that that Muslims for

(1:41:30) instance or east Asians or no they're like they think if you have sex you go to hell that's not my question I'm

(1:41:35) asking what they would categorize as a prostitute and why why should we go with your definition of I don't know what it is I don't even know what it is that's

(1:41:42) what you're saying is I don't even know what a prostitute is there it is you don't know I think couples's [ __ ] un

(1:41:50) only fans are not prostitutes at all yeah but why why aren't they cuz they're not meeting a guy to [ __ ] in

(1:41:55) their hotel for money that's what I think a prostit you're my definition prostitution is not a bad

(1:42:01) word to me and I think you're interpreting it as a negative I kind of do right I don't like it's a blunt word

(1:42:07) for what you're doing but I have no problem with that word right you're still my friend and you could be a prostitute I could care

(1:42:13) less [ __ ] have so many friends that are prostitutes the power to don't care yeah okay that's fine if you concede

(1:42:21) that you think that that's what a prostitute is if you don't then I need some criteria for why it's not that thing I look at it

(1:42:28) like the way I see it is you hire this chick you pay her to [ __ ] you MH or do

(1:42:34) sexual acts for you whatever [ __ ] who knows yeah or maybe shove something down your dick up your ass whatever it may be

(1:42:40) but you pay her to go hang out with her yeah and unless I film it and then distribute it and now she's not a

(1:42:46) prostitute if browsers hires two girls to come on set with scripts and tests and they walk through a corporate

(1:42:52) [ __ ] no it's not yeah so the script is three lines script is three lines I and and

(1:42:58) it's filmed and we exchange the money totally different yeah and you you sent it out it's a completely different thing

(1:43:04) yeah based on based on you just made it the [ __ ] up let's not bring Kiki into this he's saying that only fans couples

(1:43:11) are prostitutes and he lost me at that one he lost me at that one I'm going to let a couple chats come

(1:43:17) in uh just paused it temporarily to allow the uh convo to go sorry that that was a blow the threshold why you putting

(1:43:23) this this guy up $10 he doesn't deserve the attention yeah we want $100 we want 100 bucks they're coming they're coming

(1:43:29) peacecraft donated $100 k When You Close Your Eyes does the

(1:43:34) world disappear object permanent not stick we have got to investigate the

(1:43:39) women who [ __ ] [ __ ] aard Andy ping what all right appreciate it it's just

(1:43:47) like PNG like picture oh oh okay I thought there was like a [ __ ] Acron

(1:43:53) no no it's like a JPEG the does disappear when I even stand I prefer to be as sleep mus what does PNG stand for

(1:44:00) yo JJ thank for the gift to 10 sub it's like a pixelated something graphic it stands for portable Network

(1:44:07) graphic great know any of that whatever fan donated $100 they are arguably even more stupid

(1:44:14) than Onan bimbos props to Andrew for sitting there and trying to break down

(1:44:20) simple Concepts to these low IQ cucks I am not saying I'm not that would be a great show though if you literally just

(1:44:25) sit there roasting Everyone by the way that would be funny that would be really funny like I literally would pay someone

(1:44:31) to sit there and just [ __ ] these guys sending these notes in saying these [ __ ] only fans bimos you guys think

(1:44:38) they live a good life with women of course you think they're getting laid all time they all 6' s huge people bring

(1:44:45) the tips in must beated $100 it is proven by every major

(1:44:50) institution that pornography what watching sex has the same effect as alcoholism drug addition on the brain

(1:44:57) these are no different from a push dot all studies Robert did you send me a DM by the way thank thank you Robert and

(1:45:04) alcohol is arguably bad we could talk about that no problem everything in moderation so so here's the thing wait

() 

(1:45:10) everything in moderation those three things oh okay go

(1:45:15) ahead Andrew when you're talking about the rates of damage sure you can make an argument that alcoholism bad there's no

(1:45:23) no dispute here but you know what I do with alcoholics I don't say you should keep [ __ ] drinking what you do is you

(1:45:29) go hey let's get you in rehab let's get you away from alcohol let's get you to stop doing this damaging thing your

(1:45:36) argument here the reason it makes no sense because you're saying the opposite you're like ah no keep going and [ __ ]

(1:45:42) sucking those dicks girl cuz it makes you happy and you white night for it why you're doing it what is that's the

(1:45:48) distinction so saying saying to to me this idea of but what about alcohol yeah

(1:45:54) okay alcohol can be bad just like porn can be bad but I'm not advocating over here that we don't treat and assist

(1:46:01) alcoholics you're advocating on the other hand there's no problem with this Behavior I disagree with you because the

(1:46:06) alcoholics are the porn consumers the porn stars are the creators of the beer

(1:46:12) of the Vodka of the whiskey and no one's coming at them you're coming at they do come at them you're coming at the people

(1:46:18) sued constantly coming at porn stars is coming at Tios

(1:46:23) coming at alcoholics is coming at porn consumers you have a problem with them sure because they're doing it too much

(1:46:29) it's ruing their life if a guy have you ever been at a bar late at night and you saw a bartender throw out a drunk he

(1:46:35) said you've had too many buddy that's a porn consumer not a porn star no no no he's a distributor of the alcohol he's

(1:46:41) the center point the distribution center for the alcohol to the consumer you mean the bartender yeah and how many times as

(1:46:47) a bartender have you been there and he's been like buddy you're [ __ ] drunk and you need to get the [ __ ] out of here and

(1:46:52) go home and sleep it off that's talking to someone their only and they say I don't want drunks in my [ __ ] bar get

(1:46:58) the [ __ ] out of here you want drunks in your bar if you're running a good and the drunks are the crazy ones that think

(1:47:04) they're in a relationship with the only F girls for talking them too much here's what's really interesting you ever noticed that that bartenders mostly

(1:47:10) don't drink they mostly don't drink what what do you mean all my bartender friends are bartenders mostly there's

(1:47:16) been yeah all the time there's been study after study about this okay they mostly don't drink it's really an

(1:47:23) interesting phenomenon because they see what being a [ __ ] drunk can do to you but bartenders will still be like look

(1:47:30) you should not be a drunk well they're legally responsible if you get a well they just don't want you to anyway

(1:47:35) because I just don't think that they're horrible people because they tend bar they say look if you're an alcoholic you should be getting help you should not be

(1:47:42) doing that there's nothing wrong with consuming a drink responsibly nothing at all that's not what's going on here

(1:47:48) what's going on here is you're like look this does an incredible amount of damage and I just just don't [ __ ] care

(1:47:54) that's the distinction they don't compare they don't compare because again the bar why'

(1:48:01) you just compare them I I I'll comp they don't compare they don't compare but I comp you didn't go with what I said I I

(1:48:07) I said the bartender is the porn distributor mhm not the porn star okay

(1:48:13) the porn distributor sorry sorry the bartender is D why don't you run for office and change some [ __ ] cuz it seems

(1:48:18) like you guys just complain yeah I mean that's not an argument no I'm just I'm just generally asking you you're an

() 

(1:48:24) intelligent we wake up I don't want to get shot seems like sh the chances are

(1:48:30) literally might wake up like [ __ ] what am I pissed about today and I just think life is so much better when life is good

(1:48:35) Live and Let Live you want to suck a dick suck it you want to do this do that why do you think that being chill about

(1:48:41) being a degenerate makes you less of a degenerate like this this always this has always been amazing to me when people are like look man the forest is

(1:48:48) burning down things are going to [ __ ] but man I'm just chilling smoking blunt what are you so mad

(1:48:54) about I can't do anything about it repeat the question back before

(1:49:00) answering I don't think even Shaq is this low Brandon shab who's that

(1:49:06) is I know who Brandon shab is but who who's that yeah who's who's that probably me cuz BR is jacked I'm kind of

(1:49:13) skinny now I think you maybe it's you you look maybe a little okay maybe he's

(1:49:18) just St but yeah okay so anyway just saying like I get yeah just just being like

(1:49:25) well because I'm really chill about the fact that everything is burning down and you're saying we should probably do something about it I don't think that

(1:49:32) that's a really good argument I just think you're going out the wrong things I also think they just like care too much you care too much about's the thing

(1:49:39) is like caring too much cuz like you're going to be dead in 50 Years bro who gives a [ __ ] if a bunch of people are

(1:49:45) having sex having F bro you just you just got to get yours and go [ __ ] everybody else you're going to make it

(1:49:50) to 90 you did when have a you're not selfish at all do you think do you think you're selfish at all

(1:49:56) course chief chief of Sinners you got to relax perfect at all let me take you to a sex party with me but it's it's also

(1:50:04) bad to say PSA donated $100 I have a child raised her well she

(1:50:11) is a wonderful person engaged now and no only fans in her past or future okay I

(1:50:17) could not be more proud as a father educate do not promote horrid Behavior

(1:50:22) good job wrath but all saying is like great job there is there is a such a thing right it's justified in righteous

(1:50:28) anger when things get so [ __ ] out of hand and people are just like look [ __ ] it let this horrible things that are

(1:50:35) happening just kind of just take it and it's like you know what ends up happening what ends up happening is

(1:50:40) riots in the UK as people lose their [ __ ] minds because they go to a boiling point guys like me we're the

(1:50:46) stop Gap we're the ones who are like before we get to this crazy Boiling Point Let's interject some logic and

(1:50:52) reason let me ask you a question I I hang out with porn stars right how annoying would I be if every minute I

(1:50:57) preach to them about how they're degenerates and need to find God and or whatever and change their job right I'm

() 

(1:51:03) not here to judge you right unless you're doing something extremely [ __ ] up like we discuss CP whatever any of

(1:51:08) that [ __ ] you have vested interest in capitalizing on it I have a vested interest in capitalizing on what the hanging out with hanging out on on

(1:51:15) Extreme degeneracy right like that's that's what your interest is your this is it too you guys capitalize on that

(1:51:21) too of the the opposite the opposite we have vested interest in stopping it

(1:51:27) right but you bring them on as if you're going to change them yeah do you think that I have not gotten hundreds of DMS

(1:51:33) from different women who say man thank you so much that actually helped a lot cuz I have bro that's not a brag like if

(1:51:39) you're be like I got women dming me how go of a guy I am like wow they're not dming me pictures of their [ __ ] dude

(1:51:45) they're dming me thank you for the conversation wow wow man I really I just some [ __ ] degenerate exploit

(1:51:52) exploitative [ __ ] right there is I just don't brag about the people that D you're married uhhuh Brian what's up

(1:51:59) have you slept with girls that have only fans never really never slept with a girl who hasn't only fans you

(1:52:06) wouldn't no I mean I've I think I've said before at this point it's pretty

(1:52:11) much a strong Note pre I have made previous statements because people will dig it up and be like well you said this previously so what I have said

(1:52:17) previously is I and this is I don't know the last time I said this but so long as

(1:52:23) she hasn't done boy girl content but then I started learning more about the nature of not to dat to sleep

(1:52:29) with I'm talking oh even if a girl's done any sort of like content with another man I don't care how attractive

(1:52:35) she is I would not have sex is it because it's out there or do you care if she [ __ ] other men as long as it's not

(1:52:41) documented do you want a virgin or are you okay with girl I'll date a woman I'll date a woman who's not a virgin but

(1:52:46) there is an issue if she's done content that's out I'm asking it's it's it's you're okay with having so no I've never

(1:52:52) slept or hooked up or dated with it's a lot harder these days to me a girl not yeah well I don't date content creators

(1:52:59) I don't date content creators something I'm trying to help you've been hanging out Andrew too much it's a lot of fun no

(1:53:06) I I date like normal quote unquote civilians girls who have sex for free

(1:53:12) well so also I I don't even they're [ __ ] interns in the the prostition the difference is also think that's bad

(1:53:20) I don't even have sex for free girls who are having sex outside of wedlock but you did that yeah so if I murdered

(1:53:26) people and then told you murdering people was bad murdering people would still be bad even fight I agree but I'd

(1:53:31) be like I don't want to hear it from you it's like a fat person telling me to lose weight would he be wrong that's it

(1:53:36) would he be wrong no but I want to hear it from you it doesn't matter what you want to hear what matters is thees is

(1:53:43) the same the Nazis used and all those that looked away when millions are killed also Brian I messaged on next

(1:53:50) Twitter let me know if wise yeah I mean really

(1:53:56) quick the only fence was slippery slope to [ __ ] by you would think you would think for sure wasn't that what your boy

(1:54:02) just said the same Nazi attitude I don't agree with that I don't even understand what the comment was like the idea here

(1:54:09) first of all he's Jewish I think I think some of the best Advocates against and who are the most persuasive against only

(1:54:16) fans were women who were onon fans some of the most persuasive Advocates against prostitution were women prostitutes

(1:54:23) guess who's the best Advocates against Starbucks former employees bro it's like in a shitty in every industry you're

(1:54:29) going to have people who come out but the reason the reason they're convincing is because they they can shed they can

(1:54:35) shed light on things that the public does not know about to to say though that we can't get great insight for

(1:54:42) about serial killers from serial killers is insane to say because Andrew you had sex before marriage that somehow that

(1:54:48) means you can't talk about why you shouldn't have sex outside of marriage that's an insane take that makes no

(1:54:53) sense but can you but why can't you have sex without before marriage what is what is getting can you imagine buying a car

(1:55:00) without test driving it well so that's insane bro you're not test driving a

(1:55:05) [ __ ] well I'm test driving everything guess what SE doesn't work for most of human for most of human history the

(1:55:12) reason that men wanted women who had a low body count no body count in fact virgins is because it assured paternity

(1:55:18) right you couldn't test drive it because I also didn't leave my zip code you didn't need to test drive it cuz as

(1:55:24) it turns out basically all thicks fit into all [ __ ] isn't that crazy no there's a thing called sexual chemistry

(1:55:30) bro I've had plenty of girls that I just don't Vibe with sexually that I actually loved and then I'm like I'm trying to

(1:55:36) find a girl that hits all the butt yeah but you know what's really funny about that right if you marry if you marry as

(1:55:42) a virgin and you are a virgin right your comparison level goes way down what's your comparison for what bad sex even

(1:55:49) is that's the worst example of being like I like vanilla ice cream cuz I've never tried any of the other flavors if

(1:55:54) every other form of ice cream was [ __ ] poison it would be a great example well it's po what's poisonous about having sex and finding out what

(1:56:01) you like sexual let me ask you a question let me ask you shotgun ask one point at a time don't shotgun the points

(1:56:08) one at a time question for and you can hold the question I'll answer it right well there's two of you yelling at me

(1:56:14) right I haven't said [ __ ] in months don't cry I'm I'm trying not you spoke so so anyway back to this yes here's

(1:56:21) what we see with people who are virgins who get married it lasts way longer than people who aren't virgins who get

(1:56:26) married and their sexual satisfaction rates that they report are much higher the reason for this the scientific

(1:56:32) reason for this is because if you have a sample size which is lower there's nothing to compare it to right but for

(1:56:38) all you know that is the most amazing sex they could ever have from their perspective if that's good for society

(1:56:45) great but I so so fine but science forence

(1:56:55) other parents he'll think I'm good but the best point you two have made was if you make something illegal you make it

(1:57:00) more enticing autobar next me I would be a safer driver knowing that it's up to my judgment

(1:57:07) thank you Alex say there's another one coming in there's another one coming in and I'll pause it for a few minutes to let you guys get through thank you Alex

(1:57:15) we're turning some of your fans you see that appreciate it Alex we have another one coming in from Sons of Liberty thank

(1:57:21) you appreciate it uh you two and I are different men to the core seems your morality rests on the seven deadly some

(1:57:28) men view sex as sacred and porn as degeneracy the Hat guy's dad was harsh and rarely said he loved him wait where

(1:57:35) did that go you I don't care my dad loves me I'm close to my dad my dad loves me too shout out to Tom I love you

(1:57:40) Dad thank you Sons of Liberty I'm going to pause the TTS temporarily just so you guys can I think my argument to you is dude well sure you could have all the

(1:57:47) scientific data to back that up but I think being a human being to me is like I don't want to commit to something

(1:57:53) without knowing what's out there right like I don't eat only one type of food I explore it all [ __ ] I like [ __ ] I don't

(1:57:59) like guess what I like [ __ ] girls in the butt if I don't know my girl likes it in the butt that's never going to

(1:58:05) work guess what if my girl is vegan we're never going to work either right so there's certain things I need to know

(1:58:11) before I go you're my girl forever like you marry forever right so if your kid doesn't or if your woman doesn't have

(1:58:16) kids you wouldn't know if you wanted to have kids with her if my I'm sorry if your woman didn't have kids you wouldn't know if if you wanted to have kids with

(1:58:23) her if your woman didn't have kids you wouldn't know if you wanted to have kids with her is that

(1:58:29) correct if I don't have kids with her yes and if she doesn't have kids you

(1:58:35) would have nothing to sample it against so then why would you have kids with her I think that's a terrible way to look I don't understand that argument I just

(1:58:41) don't want kids so let's try this again yeah explain it to me it's just confusing me Sor you're say I must [ __ ] you to know if we're sexually compatible

(1:58:48) and we have blah blah blah blah blah well then why shouldn't you go with a chick has kids that way you can make

(1:58:53) sure she's a good mother no because well I don't I don't I don't need a mother I'm not looking for a mother but a good mother for your kids yeah but I find

(1:59:00) that in her other personality types oh wait wait you mean you can know that you

(1:59:05) can't know if someone suck a dick until she sucks it wait no matter how much my girlfriend's like baby look at me and

(1:59:11) you can't know she's going to be a good mother for your kids unless she already has kids yeah I can I how because she can take care of herself her life

(1:59:18) everything around her how she treats her that doesn't prove that she would be a good mother any more than it would prove

(1:59:23) first of all I don't believe for a second for a second that you don't know if you have sexual chemistry with a

(1:59:28) woman until you've slept with her cuz the reason you want to sleep with her is cuz you have sexual chemistry the one I

(1:59:33) sleep with her is cuz I'm horny dude you met I disagree I disagree so you just [ __ ] everything you see yeah oh okay

(1:59:40) that's the idea we didn't grow up gorgeous like you dude that's the idea okay so so if you see it Fu you're a

(1:59:46) handsome guy dude if I drink six shots of tequila I'll literally sleep with the anyone with a heartbeat at the end of

(1:59:52) the night right it's better than my so what I'm saying is if you can create indicators for why a woman X would be a

(1:59:57) great mother even if she doesn't have kids for you comparon Banas let me finish you can find you can find

(2:00:04) indicators for sexual compatibility outside of sex that argument makes no sense what how what are the sexual

(2:00:10) indicators until [ __ ] you well let's start with this let's start with the idea that if you have nothing to compare

(2:00:16) it to you're a virgin she's a virgin it's going to be the best sex you ever had no matter what it's the only sex you ever had the wor

(2:00:22) now hang on hang on hang on you can't possibly I love you but you can't be defending being virgin first let's move

(2:00:28) on to the next I'll defend being a virgin too yeah not only that but let's move on not let's move on to the next

(2:00:34) idea idea oh wait really really hot really really hot woman who I'm dating

(2:00:39) right now who I'm sexually charged up about I'm just certain that we're not going to have any sexual chemistry at

(2:00:44) all even though people who have waited to have sex for months with each other say it's some of the best sex that they've ever had because they waited and

(2:00:52) dude I've met I've been with girls that I thought were going to be great in bed and they're not and then you go you know

(2:00:58) what I need those pieces in my life so I'm sorry like I wait can't you teach a girl you can't teach a girl how to be

(2:01:03) good bad you teach a girl how to suck a dick what am I gay that you have the best sex with would that be gay to tell

(2:01:10) this is how you suck at girl no you don't show her we all have that girl that we don't make her practice on who

(2:01:16) you hey back when you were doing you me I prefer someone that shows up know how to play the game a woman get really

(2:01:22) really good at having sex by having less or more sex yeah absolutely so they had more sex why can't they just have the

(2:01:29) more sex with you because I suck at sex and I'm waiting for you to show up already good with guys that are better than me bro so wait you need guys to

(2:01:36) [ __ ] your chick to make sure that she's good enough before me okay then you

(2:01:41) don't go to the Olympics for without training four years I need men to [ __ ] my chicks so that you'll get enough to

(2:01:47) have sex with me that's your position no I I don't I don't Wild position okay can

(2:01:54) I say one thing before I but the idea of Sheltering someone so they think you're good as if you relate that to any other

(2:01:59) thing that's really [ __ ] I shelter my kids from alcohol wait wait I shelter my kids from alcohol that's bad parenting

(2:02:06) what country is it South Korea or North Korea where they don't let you watch TV outside to see how good the world is so their shitty lives don't look as bad

(2:02:12) yeah that's a [ __ ] that's [ __ ] awful that's an extrem that's what you're doing with your dick wait wait wait wait that's an extraordinary

(2:02:18) example but I would say this what's doing there's all sorts of public smut you don't know how bad the other dicks

(2:02:23) are wait your whole life to [ __ ] me and you'll probably like it there's so much in the way of propaganda that if you

(2:02:29) remove from TV would be perfectly acceptable for both you and I not only that you regulate this type of of [ __ ]

(2:02:35) constantly constantly in your daily life you don't even think twice about it non-stop all the [ __ ] time why do you

() 

(2:02:42) got locks on your door why CU have [ __ ] you don't want to steal there cuz I've

(2:02:47) been using my dick pump my dick game so good crazy girls are coming back over so you make the you make the Assumption bad

(2:02:53) thing could happen right yes yeah so so you have a lock you you put the [ __ ] lock on the door just in case bad things

(2:02:58) happen so you can make mitigation mitigation from risk of bad thing happening so if you were to go to your

(2:03:06) kid for instance and say see this alcohol right have a drink at 10: would they be more or less likely to become

(2:03:11) addicted to alcohol more likely more likely so keeping that away from them keeping that experience from them is a

(2:03:17) [ __ ] good thing your example here is to say no keeping the exper away from

(2:03:22) him you're Sheltering them and doing something evil it's like no the opposite is true kids will find it anyways you're

(2:03:28) keeping it away from what does that mean your kids will find it no they won't necessarily find I drank a lot of these

(2:03:35) porn girls are Mormons okay and they were sheltered their whole lives they went to all girls school they weren't allowed to talk to boys and then when

(2:03:41) they turn 18 they say now I want to get [ __ ] by eight dicks in my mouth like you said yeah here's what's really funny

(2:03:47) considering that the sample size too much Sheltering can [ __ ] some up considering that the sample size of the United States mostly identifies as

(2:03:53) Christian it wouldn't surprise me if most people who were raised Christian end up in only fans because it's a much

(2:03:58) larger sample size no I'm talking about much larger talk extremist the extremists that really bro if you say

(2:04:05) most of the [ __ ] uh only fans chicks and Utah are Mormons that makes total sense cuz most of the people in [ __ ]

(2:04:10) Utah are Mormon yeah that's why that makes sense but so many of them that doesn't mean Mormonism equals

(2:04:18) porn I don't see other that that's not what that means well it it means that if you [ __ ] shelter someone too much

(2:04:25) Rebels are going to break out no it doesn't it just means that if your sample size is almost 100% of this that

(2:04:32) if any deviation of this is this other thing becomes this other thing that was the whole sample size to pull from it

(2:04:38) doesn't mean being this leads to that that would be an insane correlation

(2:04:43) nutty correlation I'm not saying every time you're getting the destiny L right now I'm not saying every time I'm saying

(2:04:49) I've met girls that weren't allowed to speak to a boy till they're 18 and now they're getting gang banged yeah hey what's that say would also say a l of

(2:04:56) listen your shelter shelter shelter life they're going to break free and and they're going to go the opposite direction what you want oh it's Shel

(2:05:02) here let me justra face to the screen and play more in 24 hours otherwise you're shelter you're going to tell your

(2:05:08) daughter that she can't [ __ ] till marriage right I'm going to tell her that she would have the best results in her life Nat to yes that's insan based

(2:05:14) on your B on your your son too yeah of course your son that's [ __ ] insane girl I get it you want to protect her

(2:05:20) from bad guys out there cool that's fine that's your view but a dude at 18 who's

(2:05:26) going to have on spring break you better not [ __ ] anyone son yeah it's going to be really bad for you you know who won't get any STDs is he going to get STDs you

(2:05:34) could get STDs from the first he going to get STDs if he's in Cancun everyone's [ __ ] by him it's a safe dice roll for

(2:05:39) me I don't want you already got him what do you mean bills and I'm good baby I'm back in

(2:05:45) Block yeah two antibiotic pills later you're you're [ __ ] golden thank God I have to take two pills gotu all the

(2:05:51) women I did before marriage it's like drinking tequila if I wake up pop two Advil I'm fine so yeah again so this

(2:05:57) argument makes no sense from your worldview then you should have a 13-year-old son tape his [ __ ] face to

(2:06:03) the computer and play porn for 24 hours no no no he needs to know every single type or he will never know what he's

(2:06:08) missing out on I just think that's I you guys aru that's what it I think you guys

(2:06:14) are arguing extremes here I'm with the hey I don't care that porn exists I'm

(2:06:20) not shoving it in front of any one's face but I could give a [ __ ] less that that it's out there it's literally doing

(2:06:26) no harm it's clearly doing a lot of harm and I showed you all the different that it does I mean you're a good talker dude

(2:06:33) and that's great but at the end of the day I'm not taking advice from a guy who has an invisible friend in the sky

() 

(2:06:40) that's it and you're a scientist don't take advice from a guy who says you got [ __ ] dead bodies wait please don't take

(2:06:47) my advice but so yes Andrew is he's a uh or Ox Christian but he's making secular

(2:06:53) arguments he's not AR single religious argum he's not making religious arguments think because you're relig so

(2:06:59) just so you know but you're saying because I'm a degenerator let me explain no I'm not I never said because you're degenerator he's religious never said

(2:07:07) because you're degenerate you're wrong or your arguments are wrong he said your arguments are wrong because your arguments are wrong you just also happen

(2:07:13) to be a degenerate me my arguments are right and I happen to be a Christian but I'm not making CHR your arguments are

(2:07:19) right because you're saying so dude because if your arguments were right you'd be in charge of this [ __ ] country if you think that you're like

(2:07:25) all knowing you saying in the world say I'm all knowing so then your arguments are just AR be your arguments and I

(2:07:31) still am not all knowing what arguments did you be you can't prove to me this whole thing the whole thing too this is

(2:07:38) fallacious thinking and let me explain the fallacy that you're engaging in the F the the fous way that you're thinking

(2:07:43) right now is to say it's called a genetic fallacy because you are this everything you say is wrong that's

(2:07:50) [ __ ] that's FCI thinking it's called the genetic fallacy because you engage

(2:07:56) in porn I'm not going to listen to what you say about I don't know brushing your teeth on Thursday because you're in porn

(2:08:03) does that even make sense I feel like that's how you feel that's literally I feel how you feel that is you wouldn't

(2:08:08) talk I feel like that's how you feel that's you yes that's exactly demon that that's what I do I'm just taking a guess

(2:08:14) that you wouldn't hang out with a porn star right I can deduce that you want to hang out with a porn star bro when it

(2:08:20) comes to this if a person is engaging in a lifestyle like that of course I will talk to them I'll engage with them but

(2:08:26) of course I'm not going to engage in anything which would lead me towards degeneracy so yes I distance myself from

(2:08:34) people who do acts that I think are bad yes I do that hey here's what I think okay I think 99% maybe maybe not you but

() 

(2:08:41) Brian I think too 99% of all these the girls are [ __ ] [ __ ] these women all

(2:08:46) these guys commenting [ __ ] only said that those guys but these people that hate on girls doing only fans and stuff

(2:08:53) if they were at a party and one of the [ __ ] hottest ones walked up to them and said you're cute let me suck your dick in the bathroom that's [ __ ]

(2:09:00) disgusting [ __ ] yeah I think you're right some of them would most 99% sure

(2:09:05) single point for you though it's the guys that get no [ __ ] that are hating on these girls [ __ ] them [ __ ] them if this girl turns around and says let me

(2:09:12) suck your dick in the bathroom they're sipping their pants faster than anyone wait a second 100 [ __ ] per now we got

(2:09:17) to untangle these two arguments think you would too so argument one think do it with a guy and an animal a barnyard

(2:09:24) animal literally I think you'd [ __ ] a sheep that's [ __ ] up well I mean if you just want to make that on your mind

(2:09:29) Weir if you just want to make allegations we'll just make allegations right or you can keep it to the domain of logic so if you keep it the domain of

(2:09:35) logic we'll entangle your two arguments I agree with the first one yes think some of the men who cap on these only

(2:09:40) fans girls and [ __ ] like that definitely would sleep with some of them [ __ ] but when you say all of them would do that

(2:09:46) not even [ __ ] close 99% not even close and you could never demonstrate it a million years we could actually

(2:09:52) because I've seen social experiments where they go up to these guys that hate on these women and they flirt with them and the guys flip a [ __ ] switch right

(2:09:58) away it's easy to hate on something social there's no social experiment that shows that you know what [ __ ] LeBron

(2:10:03) he's the worst no he's not you're hating on someone that is greater than you and [ __ ] him Jordan [ __ ] who says [ __ ]

(2:10:10) LeBron now [ __ ] this hot girl [ __ ] Sky Bri you would do anything to [ __ ] get a yeah let me ask you this to smell her

(2:10:17) hair so let's let me ask you this then and we'll we'll just see we'll one of us kind of has the the right way of

(2:10:23) thinking about this let's say a girl walks over to a guy she's really really hot and she says hey man okay I have

(2:10:30) [ __ ] 1,000 men and I want you to be 1,1 right next to her is a girl who's

(2:10:35) equally hot and she says I [ __ ] no men and I want you to be the first one which

(2:10:41) one does he [ __ ] hang no let him answer which one does he [ __ ] can I answer which one does he let him answer which

(2:10:47) one does he [ __ ] if you're picking a kick if you're picking a kickball team does he

(2:10:52) [ __ ] question plays if each of them were presented separately he's doing both no

(2:10:58) they with those two options together I would I would disagree with Corell I like uh I like the one that hasn't had

(2:11:05) as many personally but I'm [ __ ] let me ask you a question if you AR if

(2:11:10) you're trying to get any argument at all if you're kiding I wants this dude to be a

(2:11:16) [ __ ] virgin get smoke crazy how long does this Goan would you want your son

(2:11:21) be a virgin at at marriage well I want my son to you don't really chime in in this podcast where [ __ ]

(2:11:27) you too loud I try to get a couple words in you're the one who's yelling at people usually thank God hey you know

(2:11:33) what thank his God that I'm not his son cuz sex is [ __ ] cool and it's [ __ ] awesome and it's some of the best [ __ ]

(2:11:39) of my life I actually don't think I would have any issues if my son waited

(2:11:44) until marriage if I also wouldn't care I don't care I don't want to think about my son's dick it's not thinking about

(2:11:51) your son's day right at the end of the day if my son wants to [ __ ] at 15 or at 37 I'll be like that's your [ __ ] life

(2:11:58) dude your body your choice well we can get we can talk about abortion if you want to but all day so

(2:12:06) [ __ ] do you see the traffic getting up here I do 2 Andrew we W it let's WRA it we got how about we'll do another let

(2:12:13) me see how long we've been going here 212 it says anything over 2 hours and 30 uh I charge $100 we have to charge the

(2:12:19) Tesla oh my God I got to get I know so do you understand but I also will say this I will pay you one compliment and I

(2:12:25) said it to him in the car very very uh crazy that you you get

() 

(2:12:31) girls to drive 2 hours get bered and drive home for 2 hours cuz you truly do feel like a little bit of a prostitute

(2:12:37) doing that that run the the the're driving to you to get to get abused and

(2:12:42) then drive home I could have moved this to La two years ago yeah you're real you're kind of a real genius piece of

(2:12:48) [ __ ] you're like yeah because you're like I'm going to give them the after I berate them they still have a 2-hour

(2:12:53) drive home to decompress I don't really think I berate them all that much I don't know I'm pretty uh I'm pretty reasonable I mean from what I match

(2:13:00) you're very quiet I match energy if some if somebody's being polite and conducting themselves properly I tend to

(2:13:08) remain do you watch porn uh sure yeah occasionally I'm just asking although

(2:13:13) pretty rarely very do you have a girl I can't speak about my relationship status okay so you're just like the only fans

(2:13:19) girls you lie about who you're with I don't lie there so you have or you don't have hold on hold on hold on hold on I

(2:13:25) can't speak about it for uh security safety reasons why oh people want to kill your boyfriend huh I'm kidding yeah

(2:13:32) uh death death death threat dude you have death threat but don't you think that's also also given given the nature

(2:13:39) of my show like cuz also I don't date content creators I don't date these OS she's a pedestrian normal girl so I'm

(2:13:46) not going to like a normal girl who's got a normal job there's no I could be dating girl for 2 years nobody in my

(2:13:52) audience knows about it they would never know I keep it very private like for with my family for example I'm not

(2:13:58) bringing my family into this ever um I do want to ask you guys I do want to ask you guys a question though do want to

(2:14:04) ask you guys a question Andrew kind of brought it up but so for you guys specifically and I would like an answer from the both of you for you guys

() 

(2:14:11) specifically individually would you prefer to date a woman same attractiveness date a woman who's a

(2:14:19) virgin or date a woman who slept with a thousand men previously depends how I'm

(2:14:24) feeling that day hold on this is to uh you want me to answer yeah starting with you um I'm going to be 100% honest 100%

(2:14:31) honest with you like if you asked me this question when I was 21 I was a much

(2:14:37) more jealous and secure man about how sex works and how people work and like I'm from night life I understand like

(2:14:44) people just [ __ ] right and so now at age 40 yeah I wouldn't to me there's 's

(2:14:51) really no difference between the two actually the girl with no experience is guaranteed to be a terrible time for me

(2:14:58) right so like so you would pick the girl who slept with if I'm asking somebody I'm asking somebody to roof my house I'm

(2:15:04) going to go with someone who's got the hours versus some newbie right if I'm going to be honest I'm going to pick the

(2:15:09) person who can get the job done right are you going to ask a video editor who's never edited video or

(2:15:15) you're going to get a guy who's edited thousands of hours of video I don't really think that this comparison MS

(2:15:21) makes perfect bro then why can't they practice with you make themselves perfect because I'm not willing to sit

(2:15:28) there and [ __ ] be your coach yeah okay so but if you were a virgin and you married a woman who is a virgin why

(2:15:34) couldn't they continuously practice by the art of dude I'm not against that I'm not against that it's not

(2:15:41) problematic that's what you wanted that's cool but some guys like I'd rather be with a girl who's been around

(2:15:47) the block wait but SE sex is not a complicated I don't think most men are I'm not disag I'm not most men dude like

(2:15:54) my girlfriend is not most girlfriends to put up with the [ __ ] I do for a living you're asking you're inter you're debating with a guy who's not most men

(2:16:01) so obviously you're probably closer to most men right you probably are right

(2:16:07) according to this and according to this podcast right so you're you're kind of you brought you know we're here but

(2:16:14) we're kind of giving you a very different perspective than probably most people will give you so it's like Fair

(2:16:21) yeah that's it like I have a weird relationship with sex it's different to me I've never had you know are you like

(2:16:27) kind of more of a I'm not trying to like at you you you want D literally are you more submissive sexually yes I

(2:16:38) am no I'm not but I'm also very boring in

(2:16:44) bed like I'm not like a crazy guy where I'm like oh my God you got to do this and this and this for me to come right

(2:16:50) but then why this expence necessary it's necessary because I would like to look I'm a piece

(2:16:56) of [ __ ] like I'm not going to practice for the girl but I would like a girl that has a little practice you've never gotten a bad

(2:17:03) [ __ ] sure cool there you go can't marry a girl that gives a bad [ __ ]

(2:17:08) it's just like that's it you could probably teach her how to do it I mean if it was that important you know Chris

(2:17:14) Rock once said a man is only as faithful as his options right so from uh just curious so at the end of the day if your

(2:17:19) girl is not licking your [ __ ] and that's what gets you off guess what someone else will if Chris Rock said it that's [ __ ]

(2:17:27) disgusting I mean hey what's wrong with that guy um and do you want to get married one day or I I don't I I think

(2:17:33) the concept of marriage to me is like yo if it's like for my wife if she wants it cool I'll do it but like I don't think

(2:17:39) then I don't need to do like I have you you have me yeah but you you've been dating a girl for eight years going on

(2:17:45) eight years and are you guys monogamous or completely okay what's where's the

(2:17:51) noral human being who has a weird job that's literally it and I have [ __ ] up perspective on the world that's it or

(2:17:57) maybe for8 years you've been with her there's not been like any periods where you guys broke up or on a break and uh

(2:18:04) but so I mean as far I guess going back to the whole uh this whole thing of just I want it

(2:18:11) for a long-term relationship I can maybe I personally even for a one time one

(2:18:18) night stand which I'm not particularly cl to have I prefer long-term relationships I prefer continuity I have

(2:18:24) heard men say though well I guess for a one night stand it might be better if she's a bit more experienced even then

(2:18:31) though even if I was in cin to half one night stands I'd prefer I would prefer a virgin I mean most one but most one

(2:18:37) night stands kind of happen organically I'm not getting your [ __ ] Kelly Blue Book value right I'm literally meeting

(2:18:42) you at a bar and then we [ __ ] and then it's like okay I'm not marrying you cool right that's it so I guess okay just for

(2:18:51) for a long-term relationship for long-term relationship I also don't give a [ __ ] dude okay so I'll just ask I'll just ask the question again just to put

(2:18:57) it out there for a longterm relationship would you prefer being with a woman who's a virgin or a woman who's had sex

(2:19:04) with a a thousand men before you okay so but you're asking a completely you it's a loaded question I prefer a woman with

(2:19:09) 100 bodies uh but it's fine okay 100 over one that's fine over I don't need

(2:19:15) zero is it says more about you to me than a than a thousand right zero is

(2:19:20) like this girl has no sense of adventure this girl is boring this girl what the hell where did she you like boring sex

(2:19:26) though no no no no no I love a very exciting life I don't want a boring girl I don't want a boring human right like

(2:19:33) if someone's like I've never had a sip of alcohol I'm like get out of here like I don't want to hang out with you like you you know what I mean so a girl who's

(2:19:39) like hey I'm 40 and I've never been [ __ ] be like oh [ __ ] and at age 36 when I was single when I met her dude or

(2:19:46) 33 good luck finding a virgin at 40

(2:19:51) yeah sure it's harder right so that's it so if I find a 40-Year-Old Virgin there's literally a movie called

(2:19:57) 40-Year-Old Virgin if I find a 40-year-old vers bro what is wrong with this right but you can find a low body count woman bro what is she I don't pull

(2:20:04) up the [ __ ] hood and read the mileage right at the end of the day I don't understand if you have to test drive the

(2:20:09) car first wouldn't you also want to check the mileage no no because that's a one thing we're not going to Che do cuz

(2:20:16) a [ __ ] doesn't break gas mileage how does it get on the road how many miles it's got on it when that engine blows I

(2:20:21) don't give a [ __ ] you know right who whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa but now you're making a shitty argument and you're being funny obviously for the sake of

(2:20:27) the joke arent what a pussy's going to [ __ ] what overheat like a car I don't buy a car with a lot of miles cuz it

(2:20:34) needs to last me my girl's vagina is not going to fall off after a year of being

(2:20:39) married but she's going to be the one chick there's going to be the one chick you're going to have a long-term relationship with who somehow is not

(2:20:45) going to be able to figure out your sexual preferences after years of sleeping with her okay well that Mak

(2:20:51) sense well what if your girl's not into that right like what if you find out your girl's like I'm not licking your

(2:20:56) [ __ ] yeah I think that if you should I think that many girls probably wouldn't want to lick your [ __ ] yeah

(2:21:02) right but there are plenty of girls that do there's girls that love licking butthole you must have some Kinks right

(2:21:07) what do you like no Kinks you just do all three positions Bing Bang Boom there's three I like like he like boring sex

(2:21:15) right good I try to not let my don't need I don't need the rim J I guess if

(2:21:21) that's not I don't need it but I want it right there's a difference I thought you wanted boring sex now you

(2:21:26) want I do boring sex I want you bring the heat right like I

(2:21:33) it I can't wait to stop having boners mhm like because the the concept of sex

(2:21:38) to me is like at this age I'm just over it like I don't care about it as much

() 

(2:21:44) right do you you but doesn't it doesn't it devalue the experience that you have

(2:21:49) and the reason you value less is because of how available it's always been to you no oh because I have a girl that'll live

(2:21:56) [ __ ] me any no not a girl that'll [ __ ] you any time but if you've experienced and seen everything that you've seen

(2:22:02) when it comes to the sexual Marketplace of course it's not going to excite you that's the problem with porn porn itself

(2:22:07) itself people's brains become rewired dude they need and you know this they

(2:22:12) need more and more and more and more crazy [ __ ] in order to sexually stimulate I'm I'm telling I'm just being

(2:22:18) real with you like I know that concept 100% agree with that concept that's how you get [ __ ] billionaires [ __ ]

(2:22:23) children right cuz they need to satisfy some crazy urges that they [ __ ] everyone else over there I agree with

(2:22:29) you y I'm saying for me it's not because I'm over stimulated it's just I'm getting old maybe I'm [ __ ] losing my

(2:22:36) libido I'm just not a sexual guy no I understand for you personally that could be the case but you can understand from

(2:22:42) my perspective I say look I'm always excited around my wife I'm not overstimulated with needing more and

(2:22:48) more gradual crazy [ __ ] in order to [ __ ] be sexually satisfied that is

(2:22:54) the part of experience I'm talking about it's not just the idea of getting in the car right and having to test drive it

(2:23:01) but it's also the understanding of wait a second if I go and get into too many

(2:23:06) cars now I can only drive a [ __ ] Ferrari or else no car will do it for me

(2:23:11) anymore that's the problem so you're just lowering your standards you're like lowering standard you're like yo if I don't experience a Ferrari I so you're

(2:23:17) kind of insulting your wife honestly it's not a so so the the greater way to respect her is to go [ __ ] a bunch of

(2:23:23) women and then come to her and say you're better yeah yeah that's respectful bro I go eat at a lot of

(2:23:29) restaurants but I go back to a Beverly Hills I'm like I'm so sorry for cheating on you like you guys are amazing so your

(2:23:35) girl so your girl right knows that I chose her yeah yeah and she chose me did has she ever told you that other gu she

(2:23:40) slept with are way better than you uh she doesn't need to dude I know I'm right you just assume it right I know I

(2:23:46) know you just assume it yeah yeah but if she never slept with another guy who would be the best guy she ever slept with you yeah but but my brain doesn't

(2:23:53) bother me that I'm the worst guy she slept with right like that doesn't hurt my ego it might hurt your it's not

(2:23:59) egotistical my girl saying it's the longevity of a relationship bro if my girl [ __ ] a black dude before me I can

(2:24:05) clearly say that I'm not the biggest dick what she did what if she [ __ ] hundred in a row before you cool you

(2:24:11) don't care I don't right well so there's the thing right is that I think that that's actually the more insecure than

(2:24:17) secure position why is inure I'm insecure because what I'm willing to just because you're willing to settle

(2:24:24) for a chick who's been totally [ __ ] run through with a high body hang on

(2:24:29) hang on buy a hundred guys in a single night that's what you say that's an insecure position a secure position is I

() 

(2:24:36) have [ __ ] standards and you need to not be promiscuous and a piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] that's the more secure

(2:24:41) position I disagree I mean it's pretty insecure to be like I'm only going to marry the one girl I [ __ ] why would that

(2:24:47) be insecure you're so scared someone it better than you she needs to think I'm

(2:24:53) God if I'm her best myage is the best everybody should get insecure so

(2:24:59) everybody should get with mentally ill patients single mom that's you that's what you're saying no bro bro they have to if they don't they're insecure

(2:25:07) because they haven't tested everything else out nah we're saying we don't give a [ __ ] who they been with you are saying that no you are you're saying you don't

(2:25:13) want her to experience other dick in case it's better you're scared of that we're cool with it go [ __ ] go [ __ ] Mingo

(2:25:19) but you love me baby I love you let me get this right I'm glad we experienced life together so then so then again so

(2:25:25) then the question would come back to why is it that you might have a preference against uh not marrying a single mom for

(2:25:32) instance oh cuz she keeps trophies oh oh wait so that's it yeah I don't want I

(2:25:38) don't want to have I just don't want to pay for a kid I didn't make nothing to do that someone cream P has anything to

(2:25:43) do with I don't want to read right okay so let me get this not that I even said that let me so let so let me get this

(2:25:49) right just want to make sure how could you judge that though if you've never yourself been a stepfather and married

(2:25:56) you have nothing to compare it to now I have it compar it to this I don't want to spend money or hang out with a child

(2:26:03) I just don't I don't want to hang out with someone I want to hang out with my girl and not be look my my girlfriend when we first started dating had a job

(2:26:10) where she had to be there 7 days a week right and I was like dude this isn't a relationship for me and she figured it

(2:26:15) out and she got her own different job if I know I'm going to go marry or hang out with a chick with kid I'm like okay

(2:26:21) there's going to be a lot of obstacles in the way it's like having a dog I can't go on vacation without dog it's a standard it's I just it's a standard

(2:26:28) it's not a standard it's it's a convenience so you have standards based on your preferences yeah that's what we

(2:26:35) so then if you have a standard based on your preference that you don't want to check who run through how would that ever be an insecure position re finish

(2:26:42) the question okay let me ask but you called

(2:26:47) me insecure it's a more insecure position I think to settle to just settle for anything based on the fact so

(2:26:54) do you think that if that someone who's had a lot of sex is a bad person and I

(2:27:00) can't love them no but what I'm saying is that it's a less secure position than a person who says I actually have

(2:27:05) preferences and standards and stick to them yes and my preferences are standards or whatever no it's a girl

(2:27:11) it's a yeah we we're joking around but like in reality yeah I'd prefer a girl who's had some sex yeah how much sex I

(2:27:19) don't know but I don't care I don't ask do you sit is it less body Partners

(2:27:25) better I don't know you just don't know I but dude when I'm hanging out with a chick I'm not like yo how how many guys

(2:27:32) have you [ __ ] before I mean the conversation comes up in relationship yeah when you're [ __ ] virgins sure

(2:27:38) when you're 21 dude at 40 I'm not insecure I know that you're a human that's lived on this planet you probably

(2:27:45) got [ __ ] and none of it's my business anymore even if it's out there all over the internet then it's your business

(2:27:51) sure but I have to want to sign up for it like I can't but so I'm not signing up for it but wait so so the men who are

(2:27:57) though how could you say that's a more secure position it's not it's I'm not judging them it's you're a person who

(2:28:02) just wants that can someone just like like something they could but I don't think that they're settling for that

(2:28:08) because that was their preference that they wanted to run through chick who's now all over the internet I think

(2:28:14) they're settling for that tell me how that could be wrong your wife your wife has been with guys before you and you

(2:28:19) accepted that sure that's it that's not that's it you're again preaching the different thing that you're doing very

(2:28:25) strange very strange first of all that's it there's a distinction between a woman who has a a super low body count who you

(2:28:32) end up with especially if you yourself are promiscuous wait do you and your wife discuss body count let me finish I'm just asking let me finish

(2:28:38) conversation let me finish and then ask the question okay boss otherwise you shot well if you shotgun I can't respond

(2:28:44) right so there's a big distinction between that between having a low body count woman and somebody who's engaged

(2:28:51) in pornographic material is engaged in only fans materials putting that out there has had sex with many men which

(2:28:59) usually determines loyalty on top of that huge distinction to be made between these things my preference was always a

(2:29:06) woman with a very low body count that's exactly what I got and I think that's because you're insecure that they hit

(2:29:12) they [ __ ] your girl than I don't even think you're opposite way I don't

(2:29:17) think you're either insecure I think you wanted that right that's what you wanted and you found it and you got it it it

(2:29:23) [ __ ] your head up to think that like a guy rearranged your guts you know that's your that's your baby girl and some guy

(2:29:29) just [ __ ] destroyed her that [ __ ] you up doesn't [ __ ] us up that's all yeah you have no and I know I'm not no

(2:29:36) standards no we're just secure we're like she's in bed with me she's having fun with me no standards is the most you

(2:29:41) know what I'm happy she got good dick before me let me ask you a question I'm happy hey if if that's true go get a

(2:29:46) baby you lived a good life let's find out if that's true yeah so you get married you going to let other dudes [ __ ] your wife n you're insecure no not

(2:29:53) at all insecure however I disted an open relationship in the spring and I love it

(2:29:59) hang on why aren't you going to let other guys [ __ ] your wife because I tried the open thing and when I do get married I think I'm going to go monogamy

() 

(2:30:04) however I'm open to open relationships leading up to marriage you would let another guy [ __ ] your wife no way when I

(2:30:10) get married we'll have to cross that bridge when we get there but I'm open to open relationships right now yeah yeah I am wait can can I ask you a question

(2:30:16) you're open relationships cuz you're not in one no well I did it this summer I was in relationship is [ __ ] fun we're

(2:30:21) having three son so I just want to make sure that I got this straight yeah you are open to other men potentially

(2:30:26) [ __ ] your wife when you get married when I get married I believe I will go oneon-one why I believe I will

(2:30:34) because because the thought of another guy wife no then you're hanging up the high okay that that shows yeah it sounds

(2:30:40) like you're insecure why no when I'm married her there's your wife want to go

(2:30:46) [ __ ] up what would be the problem between having people [ __ ] your girl

(2:30:51) before you met her and [ __ ] your girl after you're dating listen I'm applying

(2:30:57) your standard to you I have my standard to you but the thing is the standard I don't stand I don't have a standard in

(2:31:03) what I want a body to count to be I have standards in other things I look for but we're not talking about the standard

(2:31:09) itself we're talking about whether or not you're secure by the standard itself okay so I I don't think I'm get marri

(2:31:15) dude I'm an insecure human being in lifefriend if the position is I'm going to be open with show that I'm the most

(2:31:21) secure because I'm willing to do the most degenerate [ __ ] bro do you understand you're just beating your chest being like I'm secure like bro

(2:31:28) cares anyway support my boy my boy Destiny so back to the argument my guy Destiny yeah your guy Destiny love

(2:31:34) Destiny yeah remember how his wife got [ __ ] by other dudes and she then divorced him I don't know what happened after yeah she divorced him did she

(2:31:40) divorce him yeah she divorced him my bad Destiny yeah it sucks for when I met him he was happy yeah yeah he was happy yeah

(2:31:47) now yeah divorce but anyway so back to this started here buddy I love you yeah back to this right if you are making the

(2:31:54) standard that the most secure thing is to not give a [ __ ] about X Y and Z and that's What Makes You Secure then if I

(2:32:00) apply the same standard to wait suddenly we introduce another form of degeneracy into this you don't like it wouldn't

(2:32:06) that be the most secure position then it's well we can all have our standards so you got to make up your

(2:32:12) mind I think you just need two people to meet who have the same like boundaries boundaries and

(2:32:17) standards right like if I meet a girl who likes doing heroin I'm not going to be able to date her right it's just

(2:32:23) that's never going to work so you met I don't think that's an insecure position that isn't and you met your chick and

(2:32:28) you're not insecure I met my chick whether she [ __ ] 10 guys or 20 guys you and your girl get to talk like cuz guess what cuz guess what body counts

(2:32:35) less than [ __ ] when you say it's insecure you're wrong no but it's guys that are

(2:32:42) think inse okay you know what I'll tell you this that's the point guys that like the point of the AR the Epstein [ __ ] mhm

(2:32:48) the psychology of that that [ __ ] is they want to be the woman's and that's [ __ ] up that is a [ __ ] up way of thinking

(2:32:56) and I think it almost relays to we can't dive into this but but on this point I want of young girls never touched anyone

(2:33:01) but me I'm her God is what I think it STS from he I'm going to totally agree that there are some men who are this way there's no doubt okay I think a lot of

(2:33:09) the times like those [ __ ] Rich Bohemian Grove weirdos with the goat MK and [ __ ] like that are super rich and

(2:33:14) just [ __ ] bored they're just [ __ ] bored out of their mind and they do all sorts of weird crazy insane [ __ ] cuzz

(2:33:21) their life has no Challenge and they just do that [ __ ] and if you read the writings it sure appears that way that really doesn't have anything to do

(2:33:27) though with the standard of the Common Man of which and just so you know no matter how rich you are right now you

(2:33:34) ain't [ __ ] Epstein Elite rich and he ain't never going to be those guys are in a way different category those guys

(2:33:40) already [ __ ] scar let me tell you this I will bet you there's a direct correlation of guys

(2:33:47) with small dicks that want girls with low body counts and guys with big dicks I don't give a [ __ ] prove it I will bet you that because I talk to my big dick

(2:33:53) boys and small dick I love high body she loves she loves it guys the little dickersen disproven the little dickersin

(2:34:02) around oh [ __ ] she [ __ ] him she's never going to like me I'll never satisfy her that's the mentality it's

(2:34:08) insecurity as [ __ ] [Music]

(2:34:13) what like you're not packing buddy I think insecurity steps from a lot of places like yeah I have a small dick I'm

(2:34:19) sure by comparison to most men I I don't know it disappears when I you know that one of the biggest feminist arguments

(2:34:25) that I've ever heard is men who concern themselves at all with the sexual history of women have small dicks

() 

(2:34:31) biggest feminist argument ever heard ever I believe I I back it what's wrong with a what's wrong with having a small

(2:34:38) dick what's wrong with having a small dick di shaming are you dick shaming are you [ __ ] body shaming to body sh

(2:34:46) coming over here I'm the first to admit online I don't have a big dick but I'm just but I'm more openminded so

(2:34:52) then so then if the two people but I'm open claim they have small dicks also

(2:34:58) want the high body count wouldn't the corlet be small anymore dick pump now it's average yeah so wouldn't the coret

(2:35:03) be that the men with the small dicks want the women with a high body count no they don't because they're oh I'll never

(2:35:09) satisfy her [ __ ] a little dick they're embarrassed that's why they like them young that's why they like them with no

(2:35:15) bodies that's why you just have anal cuz it's always so gu guys that can [ __ ] good with huge dicks they could take a girl with 10,000 bodies not care and

(2:35:22) still feel confident in the bedroom that's why I stick to anal sex agree that was for you car thank you I didn't

(2:45:25) not be a degenerate usually well I'll have to retrigger this one are we on the right or left right like I would say if you

(2:50:57) before you make the closing statement before we wrap up really quick you

(2:51:03) guys donated $69 you two just need to forgive your

(2:51:09) parents so you can stop acting like edgy teenagers acting edgy after 18 is just

(2:51:15) sad brixon go to an orthodox service with Andrew yeah I I'm going to go

(2:51:21) eventually but this past week we've had Andrew here week week and a half has been super packed with stuff um so guys

(2:51:29) if you want to learn how to become a master

(2:51:35) debater you got it ready Nick okay I thought verbal comat guys you got to go

(2:51:41) to debate university.com Jokes Aside if you want to learn how to think debate

(2:51:47) and craft arguments like Andrew Wilson if you want to debate like Andrew Wilson you need to get his course of verbal

(2:51:53) combat there's about six hours of instruction 80 plus different educational videos you can find it all

(2:51:58) debate university. question if I pay you for this University will you teach me how to

(2:52:04) debate for sex workers or will you not bend your Mor actually that that's Teach

(2:52:09) Me How to Argue you I always think that the best idea for people who disagree is

(2:52:14) to teach them the best ways to debate because I feel like if if they learn logic they'll come to similar

(2:52:19) conclusions as it's just hard because I this is less logic and it's like you know I know there's logic to it there's

(2:52:25) l no to what to the to like the arguments we're having today oh no I I understand that but there's also a lot

(2:52:31) of emotional right I can't can change I can't change how I feel right you can

(2:52:37) change how you feel you can yeah yeah I don't think I can people change how they feel all the time I don't think I can change how I

(2:52:43) feel about sex workers I just don't never um it's kind of like I can't change

(2:52:49) I can't change how I feel about this iPhone even though I know it's made by Chinese slaves children right like just

(2:52:54) it is what it ising then it's hard for me to believe that you can't change it if it's arbitrary what do you mean well like for

(2:53:01) instance the first time I smoked a cigarette I didn't like it but the second time I smoked one I like to find

(2:53:07) my feelings on it changed you can definitely through the course of doing something right change your feelings on

(2:53:13) it or you can run into arguments or rationalities that make you change your viewpoints on cool if four porn stars I

(2:53:20) found out robbed my house mhm guess who hates porn stars you

(2:53:25) yeah but I have a great relationship with them so I have no reason to hate them oh it's not and so my emotional

(2:53:30) attachment to them paladins donated $69 I agree with the feminists I only

(2:53:37) shoot POV amateur style corn as Brian can attest you have to keep your labor

(2:53:42) costs minimal just me and the girl no crew required just like a prostitute

(2:53:50) that's pretty funny set paladins up with a custom TTS thing that's my favorite by the way PV amateur boom huge okay um

(2:54:15) anyway so the the point is is um I do appreciate it I do think you guys need

(2:54:20) to think about your positions on this because they're not great right and you what I don't get is especially for you

(2:54:28) you deal with these sex workers all the time you know none of the stats on this you don't really you just don't really

(2:54:39) great day every but also like who wants to sit there and be like this is what I do for a living let me break it apart about how bad it might be versus like

(2:54:46) guess what I'm doing things that I think are good and fun and I'm using people

(2:54:52) and hanging out with people that might be influencers porn stars musicians whoever crosses my path that I kind of

(2:54:57) [ __ ] with that's it they just happen to be my life is this happy little Truman Show dude good way to never question

(2:55:27) industry we needed you and that makes me happy okay well I was able to demonstrate pretty easily the great

(2:55:32) harms of this industry I don't think my opponents were able to demonstrate anything to the contrary of that and

(2:55:39) their their arguments their arguments essentially just came from emotion which is fine I understand why right you're

(2:55:44) not Debaters I get that and I was not I didn't go Hardball on I did want to get the view points out so

(2:55:51) I appreciate you guys coming out it was it was nice of you to do and we made some uh some good content today you're
