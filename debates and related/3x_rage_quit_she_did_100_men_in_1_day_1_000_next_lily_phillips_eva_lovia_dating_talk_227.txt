(4:58) came from Idaho and now I live in SF uh I have no education I was homeschooled
(5:04) MH and I make most of my money through research right now but I also have done sex stuff of varying sorts in the past
(5:12) when did you uh when did you start doing s work started sing about 2018 2018 okay
(5:18) um and what's the nature of the or I guess the scope of the S work that you've been involved in well I have ads
(5:25) online and then people email me and they're like hey can I meet up and I'm like yeah and then they show up and then
(5:30) we go to hotel room and then they give me money actually did it last night in the hotel room that I used to stay here so I met somebody are you guys sharing
(5:37) uh no we're the same Hotel not same Hotel oh wow okay yeah so a lovely
(5:43) gentleman he's really great um okay yeah all right and uh what's I guess uh is
(5:49) there like a going rate or is it just kind of I Char 4K for the first hour and then a th each
(5:55) additional hour okay how many did he just do the one or was he like a baller and just it was a couple hours like how
(6:00) what if what if somebody wants like a day like 24 hours is that you give them a discount or I just changed it a little bit I think it's like 40K or something
(6:08) maybe 30 okay it doesn't happen often I don't really escort that much anymore because I make more money from writing
(6:14) but um okay I still occasionally what do you what go what do you do with the hotel rooms you guys just um talk about
(6:21) things chess uh yes and also have entra course oh okay cool and uh you also did
(6:29) O 2 is that correct and you were kind of an early adopter is my understanding yeah yeah I was one of the first I
(6:34) signed up first in 2017 um and then when it first hit I was
(6:39) uh making around 100K a month very early um but now I don't work on it that much
(6:44) anymore it's kind of repetitive okay got it uh what about you uh my name is
(6:50) Candace horbach I'm 35 I was in the adult industry from about
(6:56) 2001 to 2017 um I left I started a podcast that's
(7:02) what I'm doing now I'm in North Carolina and splitting my time between there and Austin got it uh and any uh college or
(7:09) university or anything like that bachelor's degree in Psychology gotcha can you say which university or Coastal
(7:15) Carolina and the funny thing is I'm not supposed to say that because when I I do now openly but when I was in school I
(7:21) had the dean actually bring me in and that was I was in film at the time and she's it was a very big deal that I was
(7:27) on film and going to college so she was like just don't say you graduated from here I was like well now I'm going to do
(7:32) that at every opportunity I can cuz I spent a lot of money so you had uh you
(7:38) had started doing uh cornography while you're still in
(7:44) college yes and she's like hey don't disclose because I see I see okay and
(7:49) you were uh I'm sorry I just did my notes Here what did you say the last name was horbach it's it's I know it's
(7:57) it's supposed to be horbach but that is like way too po for me or anyone to say so it's uh we just say horback it's not
(8:05) mine that is like super ironic but okay I know I know written in the stars and
(8:11) um so you were in uh your senior year of University when you started doing sex
(8:17) work or um I think it was my junior I was going parttime mhm and was there like a period of time where like people
(8:24) didn't know but then like your fellow student body did they find out it came out pretty quick okay and like how was
(8:31) that I guess going through maybe your senior year where like people knew maybe even your Junior I don't know amongst
(8:37) peers it was fine cuz when you're young like that people don't tend to be as judgmental and you don't really
(8:42) understand the ramification so you kind of just like live in that moment and you can be kind of seduced by all of those things um Family obviously didn't take
(8:50) it well I think it's very rare that they do so that was an issue um but I feel like most of the negative impacts of
(8:58) that decision came like way later after I got out actually okay and um uh are
(9:06) you able to share the your creator name or yeah yeah I don't care I'm an open book yeah so my stage name was evalovia
(9:12) um I mean they both names are kind of tied together in perpetuity got it okay
(9:19) um what about you um I'm Lily Phillips I am 23 I'm from darbishire in England I live
(9:27) in London um um what was the the question uh occupation occupation and uh
() 
(9:34) education adult star and the highest level education I think I got was a btech at College btech yes and was that
(9:42) like a so just before you go off to University you go to college in England you could rather go to college or do a
(9:48) levels and I went to college and did btech okay I mean and you recently uh
(9:53) and you've been on the show before so welcome back thank you um you've recently created quite a stir online
(10:00) with uh you filmed a uh a 100 per you slept with 100 men 101 101 get it right
(10:08) you snuck another one in there um uh and that was in December or November when was that I did that in October October
(10:15) okay and uh there was a documentary surrounding it went super viral everybody was com still is commenting on
(10:22) it I actually saw you did a recent interview with Russell BR is that yes interesting one definitely and so but
(10:29) you're now your eyes are set at you going to step it up what's
(10:35) going on number a thousand yeah H yeah so you're going to do a thousand in a in a day yes I was watching Australian
(10:42) check already do that paron I think she did a 100 or something what did you say sorry say I thought that Australian
(10:49) chick who was on the show already did that I don't know about that but yeah I
(10:54) did 101 and now I'm going for a thousand yeah I thought she did a Brian
(11:00) I I can reference the article though I think that the it was like the Australian I don't know they have like a
(11:05) Sun Times or something and they were writing about that art or writing about that I'll I'll reference it but I
(11:11) thought yeah I thought that that had already been achieved I guess well my understanding with Lily here is whatever
(11:16) the record is you're going to break it yeah I want to break a record that's it doesn't matter who's done it before or
(11:21) whatever and then I guess what are the terms of that like how logistically a th
(11:27) that's a lot like how are you going to it all has to be like penetrative and
(11:32) yeah just in out in out on like a conveyor about of Cox a conveyor about a
(11:37) [ __ ] Carousel yeah yeah just okay amazing all right um and they each get
(11:43) like two minutes or how does that less less like 40 seconds i' probably say
(11:49) like honestly each of them get like five seconds for a second just to see yeah like they get one thrust yeah one thrust
(11:55) each so this was um apparently the record set by Bonnie Blue it was 1057
(12:02) men the single day that's who I was referencing by the Australian chick but yeah so iess I guess that's been done so

(14:59) some of that more stuff as we uh get through the show what about you I'm Becca slider I'm a confidence coach and
(15:05) a speaker and I host a podcast and then I'm also a 1% Creator on only fans all
(15:10) right uh age 43 okay and uh where where
(15:15) are you from where do you live Ohio I just totally stopped short sorry about that and uh educ an unfinished degree
(15:23) and counseling unfinished did you get your ass it will not be finished no okay and uh my understanding at least what
(15:29) you indicated to us in your pre-show notes you used to be a pastor correct I was a pastor for which denomination it's
(15:34) non- denominational okay yeah um so you were like I don't know the process were you ordained how does that work uh yeah
(15:39) ordained so it would be more of an Evangelical style of church okay and then you were um like were you raised as
() 
(15:47) a Christian oh yeah I was raised Conservative Christian also non non denominational n denominational and then
(15:52) did you have to go to like a school to become a pastor or how does that work no um it depends on the church you're in
(15:58) every denomination is very different as to what they allow and a lot of denominations do not allow women to be in Ministry yeah and how long were you a
(16:05) pastor for um on staff and and then unpaid as well 10 years 10 years mhm but
(16:12) no longer no actually about uh five six years ago I not only walked away stepped
(16:18) down from Ministry I walked away from the church I deconstructed my faith which was one of the hardest most painful things I've ever done in my life
(16:26) and uh yeah now I'm I would consider myself spiritual but absolutely do not subscribe to any Christian beliefs so
(16:33) you're maybe agnostic yeah that would probably be more accurate as an umbrella statement all right you you went through
(16:38) the process of Christian deconstruction yeah MH okay Y what uh just if you don't
(16:44) mind me asking very briefly sure what was the most compelling argument for deconstruction for you the compelling
(16:51) argument to begin deconstruction no the compelling argument that led to you
(16:56) finally walking away from deconstruction sure yeah it was actually getting really honest about the fact that the beliefs
(17:02) that are Staples of Christianity are all founded in fear they're not actually they're they're masked in love but they
(17:09) are founded in fear and therefore very unsupportive to a life that is eliminating fear and
(17:14) shame yeah so so they it wasn't any historical argument or anything like
(17:20) that it was something which was foundational to how you felt about your life fear this type of thing yeah I
(17:27) would say that would be the the foundational part and then you said as far as like some of the things in the Bible that you can tear apart I didn't
(17:35) even get into a lot of those but I follow a lot of people who kind of tear them apart and it's pretty easy to see
(17:40) the holes I see okay all right what about you hi yeah I'm Carly I'm 21 and I'm

(21:03) I'm happy to be here tonight and talking with all of you all right welcome everybody we have uh two chats coming in
(21:09) here I'm going to let them come in from metromat sorry for the delay on these metromat donated
(21:15) $200 wow Brian you really outed yourself this time the ultimate D gen panel can't
(21:22) wait to hear the grift from the P Stars oh man okay do you guys want to respond
(21:27) to these Metro Mt here I love it takes one to No
(21:33) One Metro matad sorry to need to be a to no a peace car that's a new one
(21:40) everybody pay attention to this guy uh yo Metro Matt thank you man appreciate it um sorry for the delays on these we
(21:46) just wanted to get through the intro here but uh oh Bo Metro M donated $200 there's more bodies between those
(21:54) three than all of UCSB this is the prime example of why more and more men don't trust or respect
(22:01) women send the asteroid all right I'll send the asteroid um he wants me to send the asteroid uh it's a little early to
(22:07) talk about body count Metro mat but I do appreciate the com does anybody want you you feel free to respond to him if any
(22:13) of you want to I don't I don't really see the the insult so I mean people that have a more
(22:19) conservative view with sexuality and Body Count tend to pair up with each other and then people that have higher
(22:25) body counts pair up with each other so the only issue that people have are the ones that are aren't actively seeking each other out so I don't it's fine yeah
(22:33) I'm not denying a high body count sure all right uh let's get into
(22:39) uh the pre- actually excuse me I need to get through this uh so what's your current relationship status and if you're single how long

(22:52) am polymeris uh I've been dating this person for four years and currently yeah
(22:59) was that all of the questions uh longest relationship the four years is the longest yeah four years is that your
(23:04) current relationship four years okay and uh couple questions here you said you're
(23:10) paully right yeah um are there currently any other people that you're seeing right now uh not with dating but I
(23:17) definitely bang a lot other people for fun and uh your uh partners of the man
(23:22) or woman man man okay yeah and he's okay with the escorting and you and I think
(23:30) you said was it banging a lot of I don't want to misquote bang a lot of people a lot of people yes men and women uh or
(23:37) just men yes okay um and he's it's all copasetic for him he's cool with it I mean he's banging probably more women
(23:44) than I am banging men okay it's open for both of you yeah okay it's just a free-for all you guys compete at all
(23:49) like yeah we were we're like head-to-head on our spread sheets for body count right now wow okay oh you both have spreadsheets yes okay um all
(23:57) right do you keep count yeah she's a data she's all about the data so um oh also I guess kind of
(24:04) related to your intro I forgot this um there's a couple like uh interesting things about you that were on the
(24:09) internet uh you you set records for showering or lack thereof yeah um and
(24:16) you posted a tweet about it because you keep impeccable data Damian can we pull up the shower tweet um but so I think it
(24:23) was in 2022 you tracked how many times you did a variety of things one of these was showering
(24:28) oh every year and uh how many times did you shower in 2022 oh I think it was 34
(24:34) or something I think it was 27 in last year okay something like that uh pull it
(24:40) up do you have do you have the okay my 2022 in stats images images my uh and
(24:46) some uh went outside pooped socialized worked took Aderall drank alcohol danced
(24:51) had sex 63 cried 59 is there is there Le like crying and sex happens at the same
(24:58) time ever ideally yes ideally she's okay got it it was good sex there's crying involved good good to know um wrote
(25:05) gamed had a good meal and at the very bottom showered and then scroll down just a little bit oh yeah whatever um so
(25:12) showered 37 what uh lowest amount of times you've ever showered in a year uh
(25:18) I think it was like 14 17 I think 17 and that was in uh 2019 my guess and how
() 
(25:24) about how about for 2025 how's how's that looking so far uh two showers so far I want to challenge you I'd like to
(25:30) initiate a call to action Aya yes 2025 is your year the least the least least
(25:37) amount of showers what do we think I think sub what's the world record sub 10 probably zero yeah for sure for sure
(25:46) well I figured out that uh if you actually don't shower often enough my skin started turning darker uh from dirt
(25:52) that in a way that like wasn't coming off during the showering so I was like don't these don't these stats imply
(25:58) though so I was just kind of looking at them you if you are having sex more often than you're showering does this
(26:04) imply that between clients you're not showering I do hor baths so I do wash my
(26:10) it's see don't bring her into the wait what I I thought you said you do never
(26:15) mind those no I get a washcloth terrible you get a washcloth
(26:22) yeah you can spot wash what if you go in the shower but you only shower below the
(26:27) belt is that the shower sounds a little more annoying but is that the shower I don't there AER Point what you may as well
(26:35) just do a full shower at that point if you're doing half your body well what if you shower you just like you just like
(26:41) wipe so I I mean I'm sorry to be graphic but you just like basically wipe a dude's jizz off and then you'll you're
(26:47) going to have sex with another guy and you don't shower in between even I mean wiping a dude's jizz off in the shower is what people do I just do it more
(26:55) locally yeah well I mean there's a there's a factor of like water power and pressure and all sorts of things that
(27:01) come with showering that probably not going to get from a washcloth well I do have a bedet and I use that very aggressively I basically like sandpaper
(27:07) off a layer of skin cheating you use your bedet when you're at a hotel cuz there's no bed in hotels last night
(27:13) check bedet after I get home and then before I go see a client some nice hotels maybe half yeah there isn't there
(27:18) isn't any bedday in the hotels there and you just saw a client so I assume you didn't shower post sleeping with this
(27:23) client right well I go home and then I bedet
(27:30) it's very simple did you bedday last night after your client no actually I haven't beded yet yeah I Haven but I did
(27:37) aggressively use a washcloth so aggressive washcloth you have to scrub it down until you're in a little bit of pain that okay nice um but you should
(27:46) try to set a record this year 2025 your year you can do this think I can do 15
(27:51) showers want but I do I do shower more than 37 times a year not to brag you
(27:58) know but if it was a contest I would definitely be winning um and then and then uh let's
(28:04) see um okay so but you're in this polyamorous relationship have you always been poly yes even when you were younger
(28:10) like 18 19 the first time I heard the word was I was like that is unambiguously me I'm absolutely poly and I've never doubted it since and never
(28:17) been like in a monogamous when I was a teenager and very Christian I was like ah monogamy is the thing and then I was
(28:24) tried to do that for a while and kind of failed is anybody else here well I guess we'll we'll get into it we'll come back
(28:29) to some of this stuff but I'll just get everybody's relationship status uh Candace what about you uh married in 15
(28:35) years married uh longest relation MH longest relationship 15 years is that the guy who you're married to yes okay
(28:43) wait so you wait you've been with him for 15 years um and how long have you
(28:48) been married 10 10 10 years okay got it and um any other relationships before
(28:56) him or um I had one and that was eight years eight years okay
(29:01) wait so that's was like high school okay got it got it um and so I mean you were
(29:07) involved and you still do like I mean you have o right so you still do some content right yeah it's like it's much
(29:14) more tame than my previous work content yeah I don't work with anyone else mhm uh but you were in the traditional adult
(29:20) content space um and you were with him for when did you so you were with him
(29:26) before you started I started webcamming so that was when we first kind of just started casually dating and then he was
(29:32) there for the whole progression of everything gotcha and uh has it presented and if you you don't want to
(29:39) talk about that's fine but is it has it presented like any issues for the relationship of course yeah of course I
(29:44) think like when you first brought it to him was he like on board or where so initially I again so I started
(29:51) webcamming that's and it was all implied so there wasn't any nudity that was for a while and I mean I took my time with
(29:57) my career so it was was a very slow progression into what ended it with just like boy girl scenes but um solo wasn't
(30:03) an issue and then I transitioned to girl girl I did that for a while that's not an issue for most men so that wasn't
(30:08) really a conversation and then as that started to kind of kick up my career I wanted to start shooting boy girl scenes
(30:15) initially he said absolutely not and I wasn't motivated enough so I said sure I'm not going to do it that lasted a few
(30:22) years and then I got presented with a contract opportunity and those things were non-existent at that time so back
(30:29) in the '90s you had the contract girls and that kind of what is what leveraged them and like in their careers it went
(30:35) away it wasn't profitable and they were starting to bring it back so I got pitched that to start a competition and
(30:41) I was like I know I'm going to win this thing what do you think and we talked about it for months before I actually
(30:46) shot it and if you look at the whole scope it was like probably a two-year conversation before I made jump yeah MH
(30:53) and um was he so he was it was a monogamous it was until I started
(30:59) shooting and then so like kind of open well I guess well so what I saw happening was like a lot of women were
(31:05) making such a harsh distinction between sex that was for work versus like in
(31:11) their personal life so they expected their partner to be monogamous while they were shooting and their justification was that it was work and
(31:19) while I do think there is a difference it's still intimacy on some level and I saw those relationships never worked you
(31:25) have to have the same rules across the board so I said if I'm going to do this then we have to open up the whole thing
(31:30) for it to be fair MH and did he he was like dating other women at that point no
(31:36) he no he didn't I mean he maybe used that privilege like once or twice okay
(31:41) yeah all right uh definitely really interesting though I mean you were you were in this relationship for the entire
(31:47) duration stayed together ended up getting married so okay uh what about you Lily um I'm single my longest
(31:55) relationship was probably just about 2 years mhm um what was the other question
(32:01) how long have you uh been single um [ __ ] um when did I [ __ ] there probably like
(32:09) wait don't quote me on this I'm trying to like actually think on maybe maybe getting on for about four
(32:16) years now three four years H okay all right uh but the relationship was very
(32:22) on and off so I can't be like oh we broke up here and that sure you know what I mean bit like bit Rocky what
(32:28) about you I'm single divorced which which do you prefer uh
() 
(32:34) how long were you married for 21 years and uh how long have you been divorced about a year a little over a year and
(32:41) how wait uh how long were you together in total 22 22 okay so 22 and you said
(32:47) sorry divorced for two years you said it's been a officially a year about a year oh one year okay how long
(32:53) separated um the same yeah same amount of time okay yeah and uh uh who
(32:58) initiated the divorce I did okay did he see it coming or no yes I was very very
(33:03) communicative even starting about three years prior talking to him about just the fact that it was after
(33:09) deconstructing and realizing who more aligned with who I was like who am I a part from religion who am I apart from
(33:15) the roles that I play mhm and when you get to know yourself and you realize also getting married at 21 not really a
(33:22) good choice uh you don't know yourself at 21 so a lot had changed between the two of us and and not only did I not
(33:29) feel it aligned to be married to him anymore I just didn't feel marriage was aligned for me at all I have a hard time with the construct of marriage so I am
(33:36) single I will be single I won't marry again any kids yes three children three children from him yes MH and um I'm
(33:44) trying to think here uh are you polyamorous I don't consider myself polyamorous um only because that's not
(33:51) something I've actually experienced yet I do consider myself ethically non- monogamous eth ethically non- monogamous
(33:58) okay what's the uh distinction um so the way I would distinguish it and this isn't textbook um polyamorous you are
(34:05) actually having more than one partnership and it would be treated very much like a relationship there's more
(34:10) romantic experiences involved with both you have love for both whereas for me
(34:16) I'm very new out of the gate now even though we opened our marriage toward the end and so there have been a lot of relational aspects and things I've
(34:23) experienced I have no desire personally right now to have myself in a committed relationship even with multiple people
(34:30) so right now I see so so just to just to clarify when you say polyamory you mean
(34:37) could be romantic other partners as well as your primary partner what you're talking about is that your marriage is
(34:44) open to the point where you just have sex with other people there's not a romantic intimacy involved in it yeah
(34:49) that's correct okay gotcha all right all right um and have you been I
(34:57) mean you've been divorced for one year have there been other men in the picture uh just dating a little bit here and
(35:02) there nothing serious no nothing serious but I mean you were married for what 21
(35:07) years or something I mean did you just go like ham like like bounds or anything um so we several
(35:16) years before the divorce we actually started down the route of partnering with other couples and that came about
(35:23) because I've always known I was bisexual and even told him prior to marriage M that I was into other women and had been
(35:30) with other women but then you get into the construct of oh now we're in church and we're in Ministry and you get you just have to put that in a box you can't
(35:37) like experience that so he knew that about me and so we started having conversations after um deconstructing
(35:42) about that and the whole point was to actually bring in like a woman but he
(35:47) put us on a swinger website and I was like oh okay I'm very openminded though just as a person in general so I was
(35:54) like yeah whatever we'll try it out so we did that for a little while um it's not my jam it's a little too
(35:59) overstimulating there's just too many people involved uh but then we moved to more of an open relationship status um
(36:08) and yeah I it's really hard for me because I care very much about the energetics of being with someone and so for me like when I stand or just finding
(36:15) somebody who's a good [ __ ] is not sorry I'm trying not to can you um can you help me with the timeline just uh just a
(36:21) bit so with your with the same sex attraction were you experiencing that before you became a pastor and Minister
(36:27) oh yeah absolutely absolutely since I was since I was 16 17 yeah were you sleeping with women before you became a
(36:33) pastor um before I got married before I got married so yes that would be before I was a pastor absolutely okay got it
(36:40) and then the church I remember you said it was non-denominational MH uh were they pretty accepting towards lgbtq they
(36:48) were accepting but it was it was um love the sin or not the
(36:53) sin so it was still considered absolutely wrong okay gotcha all right thank you for clarifying appreciate it
(37:00) and uh so you did swing during your marriage yep mhm okay and you would go
(37:05) to swingers parties or were you just meet up with a couple and meet up with a couple was more yeah we tried a few different like clubs that's again I mean
(37:13) how many different couples do you did you swing with um that's a good question
(37:18) maybe four okay four total I think mhm sure all right all right uh what about
(37:24) you Carly um well like okay well I'm single right now yeah single how long you been
(37:31) single for I've been single for like 5 months or it's been a while um my last
(37:38) relationship ended like over the summer and it was like 5 years
(37:44) um yeah okay who broke up with who yeah he yeah he cheated on me with a teenager
(37:50) with an 18 year-old um so an adult well it was like right after like he was
(37:57) waiting but yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah um and so I found out and then I like
(38:04) punched him in the dick and then that was it you punched him in the dick like literally or fig figuratively no like
(38:11) like literally yeah figuratively punched him in the dick okay nice in the balls
(38:17) did the balls catch any I don't I mean or just the dick I don't know just you don't know you the general flash okay
(38:23) the general area I mean any rebounds any other guys you've been seeing or yeah yeah I mean I've been like kind of just
(38:30) going out and like doing whatever cuz I mean catching up on 5 years is like you
(38:36) know what do you mean by catching up on five years what does that what does that mean just like well basically like just
(38:43) going out on dates like seeing different people and like just kind of figuring
(38:49) out like what my type is and like how all that works out and I mean kind of
(38:55) similar like I mean I'm I'm pan and so I've been out with like a bunch of different people and women and all of
(39:02) that and it's just been like good to yeah like catch up with the last five
(39:08) years sure and uh do you have a roster currently a roster no like are you kind of like dating multiple people or just
(39:15) not right I don't know previously previously I had I had a roster how big was the roster it wasn't that big it was
(39:23) like okay five six like yeah like maybe seven
(39:30) seven multip by three and that's the real number no that's seven I mean 21 that's czy just the roster but no yeah
(39:36) that's like too many people to keep up with okay and then do you have a roster currently you got a roster cuz you're
(39:42) enm right so I don't keep track why would I keep track so it's it's you can't even keep track right it's like no
(39:49) but I didn't have a roster before oh no it's not it's not 100 I have no idea how do you know if it's not 100 if
(39:55) you don't keep track uh just because of time in right so like how much time I've actually not been and I'm not having I'm
(40:02) wildly under effed so wildly under so you're celibate no I'm just under oh you

(40:21) sorry I'm confused um didn't she say you were married no she's the conversation
(40:28) um and so but did you have a rebound or you mean when I after I got divorced no
(40:34) there's no rebound because we were already having sex with other people so it was a very easy transition out oh not
(40:40) just the swinging you were like individually [ __ ] other people during no there was like the swinging and then
(40:45) that ended and then it was open relationship during the marriage during the marriage for a period of it correct
(40:51) and then you were okay you were seeing people then I see okay yeah all right and uh
(40:58) was there a roster during the marriage we were monogamous up until that point up until the swinging yeah but so
(41:03) there's The Swinging then it was open during the open period did you have a roster just during the open Period or
(41:10) after sure oh like how many different people were you kind of like simultaneously D at the same oh very few

(41:38) heart um before my current relationship I was single for 4 years um and I had a
(41:45) roster if that's what you want to call it but half of them were my exes cuz I don't like to put my number

(46:02) all right thank you Jackson appreciate it man um all right we do need to get into some of the pre-show notes so why
(46:08) don't we start with uh let's start with Aya uh let's see sorry one sec let me
(46:15) there's so much uh so Aya you were homeschooled from birth uh to the end of
(46:20) high school your parents were uh Evangelical fundamentalist Christians in
(46:25) Idaho is this like Westboro Baptist or no oh we thought they were cool but we
(46:30) were not Westborough but like kind of similar or yeah I would say if there's a spectrum from like normal Christian to
(46:36) Westborough we were like probably 70% close to the West B okay uh you said calvinist calvinist okay you said after
(46:43) leaving home uh losing your faith in failing to attend college you turned to a series of shitty jobs involving uh
(46:50) like a factory work waking up 400 a.m. you escaped from that into the warm wet Embrace of uh adult content which you
(46:59) used to fund dives into far away Realms both physical and psychedelic you did a
(47:04) documentary or two you spent a year somehow getting addicted to LSD and
(47:11) you did become one of the top only fans creators until your attention span R out I believe that was the bio on your
(47:17) website yes um and you've done escorting uh we talked about the shower thing we
(47:22) won't we don't need to touch on that um and you've been involved in sex works since you said 2017 was it or uh since I
(47:30) was 20 since you were 20 okay gotcha and uh your dad was super conservative yes
(47:36) professionally so and uh I watched most of your interview with Lex Freedman is
(47:41) really interesting um you said you grew up in a very patriarchal uh I guess
(47:46) household yeah where and uh to quote you you said women were subordinate to men
(47:52) in regards to making decisions when married um and so I was curious on this this um I it sounds like you kind of
(47:59) disagree with this sort of sentiment uh I guess maybe a jumping off point and we can get into more broad General
(48:05) conversations related to that um does anybody kind of agree with her when it comes to like should women be
(48:11) subordinate to men when married ask Kanye
(48:18) West did he just show us that's like being subordinate right what his naked
(48:24) wife on the Grammy red carpet she submitted to him to do that allegedly
(48:29) that's her idea like she she really enjoys being naked from what I hear pre
(48:35) pre Kanye West there was not a lot that was stopping that woman from taking her clothes off for anybody who she could
() 
(48:40) take them off for for a camera so just pointing that out I think subordinate is an interesting word I do like I I do
(48:46) believe that men should be the leader in most situations and relationships but when I look at marriage specifically
(48:53) it's um I hate the word partner cuz it's like so co-opted but you're supposed to
(48:58) be complimentary to each other right like we bring out the best and we demand the best out of each other so I think
(49:04) women are really good soundboard for men and like the best relationships they take advice from each other but I do
(49:09) think that there needs to be a leader in the relationship and typically should be the man does anybody agree with that I
(49:15) agree with that or do you guys think I don't know what the s word means subordinate yeah um submissive basically
(49:25) underneath I guess you could say um but does anybody here just subordination would be
(49:31) an underling so like if you're if you're at a you got to work right you got a boss uh he's the boss you're the
(49:39) subordinate thank you so who agrees with uh Candice like should the man be the
(49:45) leader or do you guys view things more 5050 well my boyriend why we just go around the table okay we'll start with you what do you think so H I think it
(49:54) depends on the relationship I think that some women can lead well and some men can I remember last time I was saying
(50:01) that in my own relationship I like it to be traditional but I support women other
(50:07) women having the choice to be in a complementarian relationship or an egalitarian
(50:13) relationship and I think the live chat cuz I can't see it now but last time I was here on the live chat they kept
(50:20) saying that I wanted the good parts of feminism for myself and I was trying to
(50:25) promote the bad quote unquote bad parts to the rest of the female population but
(50:33) that's not the case it's just like how I have respect for people who are of a different religion than me then that
(50:40) doesn't mean that I'm contradicting myself I respect their right to make that choice to believe in what they do
(50:46) what's what's the nature of the your relationship um well I'm kind of like
(50:51) stay atome and he is the bread winner going around the table what about you um
(50:57) I also think that when I think of a man I think of someone masculine that kind of takes care of you in a sense more
(51:03) traditional um I definitely am a little more outspoken so if we can banter back
(51:09) and forth and do things like that and have a say in what we're doing together
(51:14) it's um better um but for the most part I I think that a man should lead and be
(51:22) more masculine and and and just take care of you sure what about
(51:29) you um it's a tricky question I think it's all circumstantial and every individual
(51:36) relationships are different and how do you want your relationship to be my relationship I
(51:44) am I'm here on this podcast and my boyfriend was not down so like but also like I paid
(51:53) for it all myself so unless like you know he was paying all the bills and
(51:59) stuff maybe like I would consider not coming on to the podcast but since I'm
(52:05) it's 50/50 then like I can kind of do what I want okay what about you Carly yeah um I think it really depends
(52:13) on the maturity levels of each partner um but personally I think that everybody
(52:19) kind of has to have their own independence within a relationship like just in terms of like everyone has their
(52:25) responsibility and like but it really does just depend on the relationship and
(52:32) like how each person is once once we go around I'm going to ask like a really
(52:37) specific question I think that will kind of get to the heart of the issue what about you though yes I agree except
(52:43) again there's so many caveats because there's all this pressure on men to oh be the leader but men don't even know themselves so you're asking them to do
(52:49) something they don't know how to do and they haven't been taught to do so this is why we get into all of the mix of the problems of what you see in a
(52:54) relationship of the woman doesn't want to follow the lead because the lead doesn't know how to lead and then she can't trust the lead and then it's a sh
(53:00) Show sure Lily I think it's really circumstantial but in my personal relationship I would like a 50/50 5050
(53:06) kly it looked like you wanted to jump in really quick or oh I was yeah I was just saying that like I like totally agree with that agree with it got it I think
(53:13) you already kind of talked about it uh a I guess your position on this topic if you want to elaborate a bit I just don't
(53:19) know what should means like should for what purpose what do you mean like like should you jump up and down and I'm like
(53:26) well you should you do that in order to achieve what goal like should there he doesn't mean should he doesn't like you
(53:31) know like mean should is like an a he's talking in the comments so when you're talking about like should and you're
(53:37) doing the little like autistic hsbg thing uh I I know exactly what you're doing it's um it's a very low tier form
(53:43) of philosophy he's saying should in the comments he's not saying should as an odd statement of a moral imperative what
(53:49) is a slightly higher to your philosophy that you would recommend I try uh well I would try I would start
() 
(53:55) with understanding that you're not in a philosophical engagement at the moment unless you see everything purely as a
(54:01) philosophical engagement and that there are you would have to agree with me that you distinguish between words in the
(54:06) Commons and you distinguish between Words which have philosophical terms so if somebody's engaging with you for
(54:11) instance a medical doctor or lawyer they're going to use legal terms or medical terms they're going to have a different meaning than the common terms
(54:17) of those words or the philosophical terms so when you say I don't know what should means I actually don't believe you in this context I think you know
(54:24) exactly what it means by should uh this is the way that I talk all the time and sort of the question that I
(54:30) would ask anytime somebody asks me if somebody should do anything yeah and I just explained to
(54:36) you that there's a distinction here uh I still don't understand what should means in this context so what it should mean
(54:42) in any context uh well it's usually dependent on something right okay like should I go to the store like you're H
(54:49) so dependent on this context what do you think should means uh like my guess is probably there's some implicit like to
(54:55) be happy kind of thing but I don't know if this is true well then we'll we'll go with that I would like to check though
(55:01) like is that what we mean cuz if so then I can answer yeah so can you even repeat what
(55:07) the question was but it's also different because sometimes people argue the purpose of like some types of social structures is not to be happy but rather
(55:13) to have like a flourishing Society or something yeah like I'm fine I'm fine getting into semantics with you when it comes to should but can you repeat what
(55:20) the question even was uh should men lead their wives or some variation on that
(55:26) yeah so he's asking from your worldview whatever that is believe you say that you're a rationalist so from whatever
(55:32) your rational worldview is the should sense here is ought they or ought they
(55:38) not lead wives for what I can't get over the what purpose like for happiness uh I
(55:44) think probably a lot of people would be happier if their husbands LED them this seems true okay I don't think I would be
(55:50) that much happier but I am not normal okay so then they should should
(55:58) they or should they not ought they or ought they not for the purpose of Happiness uh you sound very confident in
(56:03) the things that you say but I'm not sure that makes you more right uh I it doesn't it doesn't make you uh more
(56:10) right because you don't understand the things I say either so I would just like an answer when you're talking about ought or ought not ought they or ought
(56:17) they not for the purpose of happiness I can't answer I mean maybe I'm very stupid and maybe you could explain this to me but uh you're saying UT is a
(56:24) common I use really small words yeah you we can use very small baby words for me uh because my small little brain has
(56:30) difficulty sometimes but when you're saying uh if should ought they lead their wives um do you mean that there's
(56:37) like a general sort of way that the world is good if it is and bad if it isn't and you're referring to like a general sense of goodness no I'm not I'm
(56:44) not inferring or making an implication for anything this is an asking from the world viiew of you who is not me
(56:50) whatever your worldview is who is not me from your world view that is not mine ought men lead their WI wies uh I I I'm
(56:59) trying to communicate my view and my view is something like I think that some people would be happier if their husbands LED them and some people would
(57:04) be sadder if their husbands LED them I'm not sure that there's such a thing as an overworking goodness uh so I don't
(57:10) really okay so sometimes thank you appreciate that yeah thanks for
(57:18) clarifying well that was a interesting exchange um I do have a question related to this though to again perhaps get to
(57:25) the heart of the issue who gets final say so in a relationship or marriage whatever let's say there's some sort of
(57:31) impass there is no resolution you can't come you know you want one thing he
(57:36) wants the other who should get final say whoever pays hold on um so and I think
(57:43) Andrew sometimes you refer to this as a threshold breaker I think but uh who do
(57:48) you think gets final say or would you I guess either in your own Dynamics who
() 
(57:54) should get final say what do you think starting with you Aya uh like it depends
(57:59) on the thing I'm confused like if you're disagreeing over like where should we move sure uh I don't know probably you
(58:06) should bet on it or like see who would want to pay more given that you had the money or make prediction markets to
(58:11) figure out I don't know I don't think I operate by these Norms but I know a lot of people do sure what do you think I think it's
(58:18) going to depend on the situation you obviously have to respect the person that you're with so to do something that
(58:24) is going to damage the relationship or blatantly disrespect the other person's not going to end up um you're not going
(58:30) to end up with a thriving relationship but it's like nothing's without consequence at the same time so it's
(58:37) trusting your gut like if you trust your husband fully and he's like this is a terrible idea maybe consider the option
(58:43) that you're wrong and that he's right and vice versa so if you're telling him not to do something and this happens a lot um if you talk to anyone in in
(58:50) business the wife will be like that person had a really sketchy feeling I don't think that this investment is good that ignores the woman's intuition and
(58:57) the thing just like crumbles right so it's looking at the history of the relationship too it's like how often has he been right about this thing and
(59:03) you've been wrong and vice versa Andrew if I have you jump in really quick do you want to provide like maybe a good
(59:08) example of like a impass sort of situation that could arise in like a
(59:13) relationship or marriage um just for use as an example here well I mean a very
(59:19) common one is just money so the idea of how money is used in a spent in a relationship versus not spent a
(59:26) relationship with one of the number one disagreements that men and women have so the idea is if you can't come to an
(59:32) agreement on how money is spent or what school the kid should go to which might infer spending money as well right uh
(59:39) ultimately there's only two of you right so uh either a third party has to break
(59:46) this threshold barrier or one of you ultimately has to be the decider otherwise how do you uh essentially how
(59:53) do you how do you come to an agreement if both of you disagree like how how is that done if one person
(1:00:00) ultimately doesn't end up with the final say I don't think one person holds that position permanently so and then it's
(1:00:07) also going to be who acts on it first so typically women are the ones that set all of the appointments pay the school
(1:00:13) tuition if they're going to private school set up the doctor's appointments they make 60 to 80% of all of the
(1:00:18) household purchases so if you're just looking at Behavior you'd say women are but that could be the man saying no and
(1:00:25) they're just making that decision anyways so I'm not really sure that any of that would matter though so I understand what you're it's what's being
(1:00:31) acted on right now right so like whether or not that's right or that's that's helpful for a healthy relationship like
(1:00:37) that's a whole different conversation but what is happening as women are I'm not sure it's actually pertinent to what
(1:00:43) I'm saying though so I I understand what your position is you're saying hey look um you know women already have lots of
(1:00:49) household responsibilities and so they're in a decision-making role already we're not really discussing that
(1:00:54) though no I'm saying that they're actually executing the decision already yeah well but they're executing the
(1:01:00) decision at the behest of the husband though that right so this is the consent of the husband essentially is going into
(1:01:06) this decision-making meeting she's doing the day-to-day activities because he's saying you should do these day-to-day
(1:01:12) activities right he doesn't have any disagreement with that it's when there's disagreement within that who becomes the
(1:01:18) Arbiter then how do we how do we find this threshold breaker between two people for who makes the determination
(1:01:25) or who has the ultimate say again I I don't think anyone holds that permanently so it's it's trusting your
(1:01:31) your partner I don't know yeah I'm not I'm not saying that well okay if they don't
(1:01:37) hold it permanently right but let's say the man considers himself to be in the position of authority uh and has been in
(1:01:44) the position of authority right this still doesn't really get to the heart of the question of if there's a disagreement and they can't reconcile it
(1:01:52) you say well the man doesn't hold that permanently it's like okay great but what I'm saying is when you can't
(1:01:57) reconcile the disagreement you both disagree who gets to ultimately make the decision whether you think that it's a
(1:02:04) permanent basis for a man to be in control of it or not I I don't even I don't I'm not even sure that's relevant
(1:02:11) really well because it the question seems that it's it's permanent so maybe I'm misunderstanding if you're saying
(1:02:16) who's in charge and who is responsible for the deal breaker that sounds like who is always responsible for the deal breaker no not really but so what the
(1:02:24) question is asking is is if two people since you know most relationships anyway are are two people I understand that
(1:02:31) there's polyamorous people here in this type of thing but that's outside of what you would consider the norm for society
(1:02:37) it's usually man woman that's it right uh and people generally tend to not like to share their Partners uh you can
(1:02:44) dispute why that is sexual Liberation whatever but it is a fact that most people are in monogamous relationships
(1:02:51) one man one woman most that's globally that's not even just in the west so if that is the case and you you have a
(1:02:58) disagreement can't reconcile it right how do you figure out who Rec you know
(1:03:04) who ultimately is going to have this say I don't know I mean I've been in a relationship for 15 years and that's
(1:03:09) never happened there's never been a decision that there was an impass and if there was if there was anything that was
(1:03:15) even close to that we tabled it until there was a mutual decision yeah but the the problem is is
(1:03:21) like what if what if it's not a mutual decision it's like no I'm not backing down on this well then how well do they
(1:03:26) really communicate how well do they really communicate because the reality is if you if you care about the person
(1:03:32) especially you're talking about specifically a marriage the whole goal of conversations where you disagree is to let the other person feel heard
(1:03:38) understood and respected and if both people are receiving that and they're safety involved you're going to be able
(1:03:43) maybe not that moment maybe not that day to come to a conclusion that feels really good to the both of you where it doesn't have to be it's my say so
(1:03:50) because I say so and I'm the lead and I think that's where the the ego gets in there and it can go wild wrong whereas a
(1:03:57) man who if we're going back to the man is leading and a man in his like healthy masculinity it doesn't come from a place
(1:04:02) of ego it comes from a very confident place where he knows who he is and he cares very much for the other for the
(1:04:08) partner for the wife and so he gives a whole lot of hex i c a lot so I should
(1:04:14) filter it about her being on board with him so it's it's a mutual exchange of
(1:04:20) again being heard understood and respected there's not going to be this okay I get the final say that's like a that's like a child which unhealthy but
(1:04:26) that is like a child parent relationship to me oh okay well that's nice and all
(1:04:33) but it doesn't actually answer the question so I understand that you're saying there should be mutual respect we
(1:04:38) should both feel heard we should both discuss things etc etc um okay great so
(1:04:44) you've discussed everything and you know he still disagrees with you and thinks no you're incorrect and I'm just really
(1:04:50) not willing to budge on this so either we have one of two choices right either the the relationship is over because you
(1:04:58) won't budge or or he won't budge or you won't concede or um or what what's the
(1:05:05) other like what's the other option you would have to concede to the authority right like I don't see any way around it
(1:05:10) I don't understand this though I thought relationships were all about compromise yeah I think the answer that you're looking for would be answered if you
(1:05:16) gave us like a specific scenario instead of just being like who gets final say
(1:05:22) because it like super that's it that's way too like if you ask a very specific
(1:05:29) like give us a specific scenario like I think you'll get the answers that you're looking for I mean the spe specific
(1:05:35) scenario wouldn't even be relevant but I could just give I'll give you one just to give you one I guess I think that so
(1:05:41) there's money there's there's money there's an inheritance of $100,000 okay it's left to both of the members of the
(1:05:46) household not just one okay and they're arguing about how to spend it and the man is saying okay listen uh I've heard
(1:05:54) all of your reasoning I've heard heard all of your everything right I've I'm hearing you right I'm compassionate
(1:06:00) towards you but also no we're going to spend it on this instead um relationship why would it not just be
(1:06:07) split I don't to me it's sent to both of them it's 100 Grand they each get 50 and they can do what they want with it yeah
(1:06:13) and also in this scenario are their kids like he's saying no right he's saying
(1:06:18) look well that's kind of no he's saying no I don't want it I don't want it split
(1:06:23) I want it going towards whatever this household thing is so already I don't have respect for the
(1:06:28) person yeah yeah this seems like such a stupid question it's about like respect
(1:06:34) not about like like you can't just give one person ultimate power and it really
() 
(1:06:40) once again depends on the situation like it's a partnership it's a relationship
(1:06:45) you both talk about it and like depending on the situation yeah maybe someone will make the final say but it
(1:06:52) depends and you still have to have that conversation and you still have to have that respect yeah so then so then in this situation
(1:06:58) we're talking about Authority then right the man really doesn't have any Authority because ultimately if he says
(1:07:06) listen this is super important to me and I know it's super important to you too right but I'm not willing to budge on it
(1:07:12) because I really think I'm right here you feel in that instance it's totally appropriate for you to and I quote get a
(1:07:18) that's a divorce right so then this this would infer that you actually have a lot of power in this situation a lot of
(1:07:25) power in this Dynamic that a man wouldn't have or wouldn't exercise so if that's the case right it would basically
(1:07:33) make men want to steer clear of marriages like that right because the the position of authority would not
(1:07:38) actually be there yeah well I'm saying divorce in terms of if he came up to you and he was like this is what we're doing
(1:07:44) you don't get to say like that's how you kind of like or that that's what I took from it the first time that's not the
(1:07:50) that's not no he listened to what you had to say everything you had to say he
(1:07:55) just thinks that what you had to say is incorrect and that ultimately it needs to go the way that he wants it to go
(1:08:02) because he thinks you're incorrect so if that is the case right then we're still
(1:08:07) if we're still in divorc territory then you what you're doing I never said we were still in divorc territory I would say that you have to have to recognize
(1:08:14) everyone's skill set right so let's say that the woman tends to be better with money in this example and the man is
(1:08:21) better um I don't know let let's say he's like a contractor so he's not into
(1:08:27) investing and he the conversation is around like what do we do with this inheritance so historically speaking
(1:08:33) she's been more accurate and More well-versed in finances that would probably go to her and then if it was something in his wheelhouse so it's just
(1:08:40) dependent on the person specialty I think is probably but that's not what's in dispute it's it's not in dispute that
(1:08:46) these two people would have variety of skills all those skills could be variously applied there could be skills she's far better at than him the
(1:08:53) hypothetical is looking towards we're not able to compromise on this one
(1:08:59) thing whatever it is there we're not we're not able to come to an agreement right we're just not able to so this
(1:09:07) this would again state that there would have to either be uh somebody makes the
(1:09:13) concession right or you part ways I don't I don't see a way around that exactly right but then earlier you said
(1:09:20) no one's holding that position permanently but you you want one answer like absolutely it's either absolutely
(1:09:25) the man or absolutely the woman and then everyone that's asking for cont no no no no this is a critique that was a critique of your worldview so I just
(1:09:32) conceded that even if it was the case that they did not that both parties did
(1:09:37) not permanently hold this position it still doesn't answer to the question of when you hit this impass right how do
(1:09:44) you deal with it when one won't compromise because they or they both think that they're right one person
(1:09:49) would have to ultimately be the person who was conceited to right and it's whoever excels in that Dominion so again
(1:09:55) it it's if it's finances typically that ends up being the man traditionally speaking so if it has to do with money
(1:10:02) it's going to be the man if it has to do with the kids or people I would say it's the woman yeah then you're then you're taking the feminist position how's that
(1:10:09) femin because what you're doing is you're saying that there's a shared Authority there's not it's not
(1:10:15) necessarily Authority and I think that there is a difference between leadership and Authority like leadership is looking for counsel and it's not just dismissing
(1:10:22) anyone else how can you have authority with or leadership with no Authority I don't even know how that's how how
(1:10:27) that's done leadership to me implies that there's Authority that you're that
(1:10:32) people are seeing you as an authority of some kind they're looking to you as an authority of some kind I'm not even sure
(1:10:37) that you can have leaders because you're instilling respect and in that respect the person is choosing to follow that's
(1:10:43) the difference well yeah but even what regardless of why they are perhaps it's because you show them respect or
(1:10:49) something like this they would still have to conceed some sort of Authority for leadership right would would you like us to be in relationships where we
(1:10:55) see to authority of a man it has nothing to do with what I would like I'm just asking this
(1:11:01) question I I just I don't actually think I don't actually think I'm getting an answer to it okay you want an answer
(1:11:07) here's your answer from all of us from what I've heard at least from the people talking it depends on the situation A
(1:11:13) relationship is a partnership nobody has absolute say over anything and if you seriously are in an argument that's that
(1:11:20) deep and like you can't compromise and both people are not like they're not willing to budge at all then why are you
(1:11:27) in a relationship like the whole point of a relationship is you guys are equals and yet you have different responsibilities maybe some people have
(1:11:34) different things that they focus on that they do but in the end it's not about gender it's not about who has more power
(1:11:40) it's about the situation and like well that really wasn't I mean that's your view yeah but that really wasn't her
(1:11:46) view her view was she thought a man should generally lead right A man should
(1:11:51) generally be in a position of authority but then when we die when we hone in on on it it looks like more more that
(1:11:58) there's a shared Authority which is more of a feminist position so I understand your position I get it you you you were
(1:12:03) clear on the outset you believe that men and women should share Authority in a relationship I get it I understand I'm
(1:12:09) not disputing that I'm just looking at the idea of if you think a man should mostly have authority I don't know what
(1:12:15) the hell that actually means if we reduce it to well unless he's not really good at it and then the authority moves
(1:12:22) over to the woman I'm not sure how we even make these determinations unless you're seeding to your own authority
(1:12:28) well that's because this has been like dragged out and you're not accepting you're not accepting anyone's answer so
(1:12:34) initially my response would it's it's trusting the other person so yes the man can absolutely lead but there's a
(1:12:40) difference between a leader and a tyrant so if you have the man that's leading and you respect his decision you come to
(1:12:46) an impass what I originally said which wasn't accepted was that in my 15-year
(1:12:51) relationship this has never come up because in that Dynamic nothing has been at an impass and if anything was it was
(1:12:58) mutually tabled until we could revisit it and come to an answer so it wasn't me taking I know why you're saying I don't
(1:13:04) I because that answer wasn't accepted or I accept that you're answering I'm not accepting that you're giving an actual
(1:13:11) answer so that is AB question the question is not in your personal life have you ever had an impass with a man
(1:13:18) or your husband or whoever that's not the question the question is not asking that not asking about your personal
() 
(1:13:24) situation cu they don't give a [ __ ] right the question is asking uh specifically if Authority is to be
(1:13:30) shared the dynamic is to be shared then who ultimately makes the decision for who even gets to share the authority
(1:13:37) right if it's going to be you you get to make that decision then it can't really be that the man is in Authority most of
(1:13:43) the time because it would infer there would at least be an inference here that you're sharing Authority with yeah you
(1:13:50) would decide that ahead of time I think this goes back to communication I think and the fact that everyone's saying all
(1:13:55) relationships are different I think if you're conversing about this with your partner ahead of time it's like okay let's talk about Authority let's talk
(1:14:01) about who gets the final say are there areas that you feel like you want the final say in and how do I feel about that are there areas I feel like I want
(1:14:07) the final say like we talked about kids money all of those things you can create so many like eliminate so many problems
(1:14:14) if you just have communication on the front end and talk about what feels good for each person it's going to look different in every relationship but that
(1:14:20) would be what I say there is just no this you're wanting this overarching umbrella it sounds like of like this is the way it is this is the way it should
(1:14:26) be that's it and it just doesn't really it just doesn't really work because I haven't told you anything that I want
(1:14:32) like all I'm doing is this this is so that you know okay she made a claim she
(1:14:38) said most of the time I think a man should be in a position of authority so all I'm doing is exploring that idea by
(1:14:45) asking her okay but if the position of authority is actually shared how's he really in Authority that's that's what
(1:14:52) we're diving hang on hang on hang on hang on that's what we're diving into right I'm not disputing that you could
(1:14:58) make pre-arrangements with somebody for who has Authority who doesn't I'm not disputing that you can't have long
(1:15:04) conversations and walks on the beach at night to make determinations about decisions in your life I'm not disputing
(1:15:09) any of that I'm just trying to determine who ultimately if Authority mostly
(1:15:15) should be in the hands of a man gets to determine that Authority then and if it's you aren't you really the authority
(1:15:25) sit here while she's gone I mean I feel like you know we've kind of said like
(1:15:30) it's like we just keep repeating our answers like sorry that is not the answer that you're looking for but I
(1:15:36) mean everybody's different and like you know if someone's in a relationship where like the man is considered like
(1:15:43) you know head of the household um you still have to make those big decisions
(1:15:49) together and like yeah maybe he'll he'll decide like what he wants to eat for dinner or like something smaller but
(1:15:55) I personally feel like in terms of like really big decisions like that you can't
(1:16:01) really have one person fully take over but once yeah I understand that I I've
(1:16:06) but I I've always understood your view your view is equality you're so you just
(1:16:11) so you know your view is different than the view of the girl next to you the girl next to her and the girl next to her I'm only exploring one view of a
(1:16:19) person who's not you right so therefore I would like her to answer the question
(1:16:25) cuz she's her and not you who has a different view hang on who has a different view than she does so back to
(1:16:31) her I'd like to just you know if you don't mind we can just finish this real quick I'm I'm actually still act
(1:16:37) confused right so perhaps without the sister Hood getting involved with their view which I don't give a [ __ ] about and
(1:16:43) just your view if it is the case that Authority is shared right uh or not in
(1:16:49) your case you say the man should mostly be an authority are you the are you the determined
(1:16:56) of that no and again so in well then who is who is the determiner it depends on
(1:17:02) the subject so L there have been conversations where and these are exact conversations if it has to do with
(1:17:08) health if it has to do with medicine if it has to do with food if I has to do with the kids it is you I trust you
() 
(1:17:13) entirely to make these decisions that has been conversations in my relationship and then I say if it has to
(1:17:19) do with money that's him all day I'm he'll ask me once in a while what do you think about this what do you think about that and then he'll Ely does whatever he
(1:17:25) wants like that's my Dynamic and I'm very happy seing ultimately to your Authority no not at all because if I
(1:17:32) didn't want to do something with money yeah well hang on you are I'll show you so if you say if you're if you're saying
(1:17:37) on all of these different situations I me he assigned them to me okay but the
(1:17:43) ones you assign to him let's say right I trust you to do these things X you know a b c d whatever it is right M so what
(1:17:51) happens if you fail or fail to trust him on a one of these particular issues
(1:17:56) right you're still going to see to yourself you the person as to whether or not this should be followed or not
(1:18:02) followed which would actually put you in a position of authority right that's never happened in my relationship I know I'm not asking if it's happened I'm just
(1:18:09) telling you that the consequence would be that you are still in a position of authority because no because I've
(1:18:15) relinquished that with with what they agreed upon in subject so if it comes to you relinquish it based on your
(1:18:21) Authority though and you'll bring it right back the second you need to no trust me there have been plenty there
(1:18:26) have been plenty of financial like bombs and I have said it and I have disagreed
(1:18:31) like till I was blue in the face and he still pressed forward and I let him do that and I did it's not like yeah you
(1:18:38) let him yeah because I could choose to nag I could choose to like make his life a nightmare I'm not right because that
(1:18:44) is so that if you want to use your terminology that is submitting right that is letting him lead right not
(1:18:50) really not really in the case of this uh it's still the the question is still kind of who has the authority ultimately
(1:18:58) because if you just say well I will see these things over because I want to because I choose to this and that it
(1:19:04) actually doesn't really infer Authority like you're not really giving him the say of for instance um let's say let's
(1:19:11) say you're in a Christian marriage um the gal here the deconstructionist she can probably confirm this right the
(1:19:17) belief there would be that uh the man is in Authority regardless of what your
(1:19:24) personal View Viewpoint is on what it is that he's doing right you you're supposed to see the authority to him so
(1:19:30) the the question here is rooted who has ultimate Authority is it you or him if
(1:19:36) you're just seeding it to him because you want to then it would imply that you still have kind of authority well in the
(1:19:42) Bible it does talk about submitting to each other a man and a wife should submit to each other yeah sure sure I'm
(1:19:47) just I'm giving you an example of a view that's it so that I can explain when we're talking about authority authority
(1:19:53) means in charge not in charge because you allow it that's the point well we
(1:19:58) live in a country where relationships only exist because of consent so you're talking about allowing like it is
(1:20:03) allowed because now we're getting into non-consent territory yeah so so in this case then
(1:20:09) the position of Authority for a man is make believe it's not make believe it's be a a strong enough man have follow
(1:20:16) through be competent and confident so that you have a woman that follows you a man is physically larger so everything
(1:20:24) that you do techic is because he's allowing it right because he could physically stop you yeah that's true too
(1:20:31) yeah
(1:20:36) so so anyway so so yeah when we're talking about Authority though it would
(1:20:42) it would just seem to infer then that men don't even even if you are saying I'm following you because of XYZ reason
(1:20:50) right you can retract that anytime you want it's not really a position of a Authority like for instance if you were
(1:20:56) in a uh a workplace right you couldn't you couldn't go to your boss and be like
(1:21:01) you're not the boss anymore no but if he you couldn't do that the only thing you could do the only thing you could do in
(1:21:07) that case is like leave you know what I mean but you couldn't you couldn't usurp the position of authority right because
(1:21:14) that would infer that you were actually the boss if you could go to your boss say you're not the boss anymore I'm the boss who actually has the authority see
(1:21:20) what I'm saying mhm yeah but do you think that there's not a distinction between a work relationship and a
(1:21:26) romantic relationship like the duties aren't different and how you show up and what you're looking for sure I'm yeah sure I'm not talking about those things
(1:21:32) I'm just talking specifically about Authority here who has Authority in relationship is a threshold breaker I and I guess it' be the same thing with a
(1:21:39) boss is like in a workplace who has the authority in the workplace it's your boss not you right so it' be the same
(1:21:44) it'd be the same thing do you see Authority and Leadership is exactly identical cuz that's like the thing that's kind of making they're not
(1:21:51) they're not identical I just don't think I think that leadership implies Authority are are you trying to figure
(1:21:56) out where the power lies like are you trying to point that power fundamentally lies in somewhere yeah I well I don't think that
(1:22:03) men when when women say that uh you know my man has uh Authority or this type of
(1:22:08) thing I don't know that that's actually the case because it seems that uh the
(1:22:14) authority is granted from them the authority it almost seems circular so
(1:22:19) just to clarify your position what would be an example of something where a man truly has Authority
(1:22:25) he's your boss at work so in a romantic relationship I mean yeah that's not what you asked you
(1:22:31) asked what would be a POS a position I know I asked it but I I used the words wrong my my intent think in the I think
(1:22:36) I think in the west it I would be hard pressed to give you an example of where a man truly has Authority okay
(1:22:43) yeah okay uh do you want a closing thought on that Andrew or is that sufficient for you yeah you and you have
(1:22:50) all the authority yeah well it's just it's just the what looking at is just uh
(1:22:55) whether or not we're we're dealing with the feminist view or not so I understand the panelists have the feminist view of equality egalitarianism this and that
(1:23:01) but she actually said something different which is the implication that hey Men actually mostly should have
(1:23:07) authority but then when we reduce it it's like H maybe not so much maybe not so sorry I missed what you were saying
() 
(1:23:14) what was that I just said that Andrew you win you have all the authority like it just depends on the
(1:23:19) person and the man I guess I don't know like you're making it seem like super helpful to the conversation I appreciate
(1:23:27) it that's basically what I got out of
(1:23:33) it big strong man wait so you're saying Andrew has all the author I'm just confused I'm a
(1:23:38) little confused I just like you know in his relationship he's got all the authority and that's what he's trying to
(1:23:44) prove is that like you know every man should be like him right is that where was any where was any of this stated
(1:23:50) like it's just all head Cannon so what you should say is Andrew I'm about to make a bunch of [ __ ] [ __ ] about
(1:23:56) and then say it out loud for reasons nobody understands you should just lead with that say anything just said yes sir
(1:24:03) yeah he's just lead with I'm about to make up a bunch of [ __ ] and then say it out loud for reasons not nobody understands H Andrew there's a chat here
(1:24:11) coming for you uh Jane slice donated
(1:24:17) $200 this creep gave me herpes and never did his own dishes or laundry he smells
(1:24:23) like chinger cheese and camel smoke and rainbows sorry for Mar smoke mar mar Boro Mar maror I
(1:24:33) don't smell [ __ ] camels all right well we're going to move on to the next thing uh going Let's uh oh Aya you sell
(1:24:39) your eggs yeah yeah so hopefully one day on your website you haven't done it yet
(1:24:44) no but you do say if you're interested in using my eggs to reproduce you're down to discuss this in exchange for payment for your time and fear of
(1:24:51) needles you have ancestry Health testing and family history that you can share uh
(1:24:57) have you had any inquiries or at all or not yeah yeah we've I've talked with some people we might we might do
(1:25:03) something I just did my first round a couple months ago first sorry what first round my first round of freezing round
(1:25:08) oh you're freezing the okay so you can like uh just sell those then yeah although I think we might get genetic
(1:25:13) engineering soon so I think I would maybe like a whole bunch of them to do a genetic engineering experiments on
(1:25:19) interesting okay how much you sell them for uh ideally about 100K wow would you
(1:25:25) do surrogacy or no I don't think so like you carry the child seems why it seems
(1:25:30) like I could pay someone else to do that oh well if someone's like five mil I would definitely carry a child for $5
(1:25:35) million for5 mil all right uh now into something kind of pretty interesting um
(1:25:41) there is a gang bang flow chart we have to pull this up can we pull up the Tweet sir
(1:25:48) Damian uh so why don't you tell usland is that is that back Gangland
() 
(1:25:54) something like that do you got it Daman yeah okay pull it up please okay uh this is your Twitter for my birthday my
(1:26:00) partner and some friends organized a huge gang bang for me 42 attendees
(1:26:05) here's the break Lily loves this one here's the breakdown of how the event was organized there were exit survey
(1:26:11) statistics and what it was like for me psychologically why don't we pull up the next tab with with the actual graphic
(1:26:16) okay um make put us on the uh other side so there were a uh 1,600 respondents uh
(1:26:24) 800 failed the auto filter uh seven about 700 pass the filter uh 250 you
(1:26:32) contacted half but like half of those didn't respond there's 83 who didn't interview 87 got invited 56 got tickets
(1:26:39) 43 did STD test uh 42 showed up five of which did not bang Aya 37 penetrated Aya
(1:26:48) 17 of which came in AA five came in the fluffer 15 did not climax um I love that
(1:26:55) this show is like the logistical nightmare of so many questions for you because when you were like you're doing so many guys I was like can I ask you
(1:27:02) about the logistics It's Tricky honestly you should do a flowchart amaz I need you like on the I would love that AOW
(1:27:09) chart do the flowchart for uh for uh yeah I could do it right I love the tracking the the data and stuffff really
(1:27:17) we could check corations you need a flowchart yeah I feel like also it's great to have someone to like verify
(1:27:23) things MH like he did penetrate yes they had me do they had me do Sharpies on my leg to track what was happening and that
(1:27:29) helped a lotp and then they signed a guest book afterwards there was a guest book yeah okay so they write a little
(1:27:35) like note or yeah it really sweet um were there rules like do they get the time limit or
(1:27:41) how does that yeah I think it was like a Max of two minutes per guy cuz you know it really adds up um did you like was
(1:27:47) there one that you liked and you gave him like next to 30 seconds or uh there wasn't it was really a blur the very
(1:27:52) first guy was a virgin and he they popped confetti when he entered me and then he shouted Leroy Jenkins um as he
(1:27:59) started [ __ ] me or banging me whatever uh which was
(1:28:04) yes I have that ready to go W lovely yeah and I was like this is an interesting experience to be in I like
(1:28:12) it when things are sural though wait he was how old was he the Virgin I don't know mid mid 20s maybe he also wore a
(1:28:17) heart rate monitor and then gave me the data of his heart rate is he diabetic or what no he just I he just offered it
(1:28:23) like do you want to see my heart rate data and I was like please wear a heart rate monitor for the yeah so he lost his virginity in a birthday King bang okay
(1:28:32) yeah only one although you did how many virgins did you do I've probably done like maybe five virgins okay I did it I
(1:28:39) did quite a lot cuz I did recently a 50 man anal gang bang and I took a lot of anal virginities recently so wow what
(1:28:47) wait you hold on like you pegged no no no then I I got [ __ ] all of them
(1:28:54) the ass ARS yeah okay congrats yeah
() 
(1:29:00) there was a lot of anal virgins though wait I got to ask Lily so like is this
(1:29:06) actually recorded though yeah yeah yeah I'll show you I'll show I feel like some of the like I don't know if it's the
(1:29:12) case for you but I've heard these stories like these girls will like make up these kind of elaborate scenarios that are just not actually true um but
(1:29:19) this is actually like recorded I'll show you all the evidence don't you or I yeah we can't show
(1:29:25) on but some you know some of these people like make this up because it's like for the clout or whatever but you actually did it yeah I did it with
(1:29:31) another girl as well um Tiff so she can vouch me as well all right okay um and
(1:29:37) have you done multiple of the the gang bang no I just did it that one time I actually didn't like it very much
(1:29:43) singular gang bang yeah okay you didn't like it I just want to see what it was like yeah it wasn't your thing no because you have to be like oh no I feel
(1:29:49) bad for the guy like is he like is he feeling okay like I want to make sure that he feels fine and then you like Let Go your the reason we tried that gang
(1:29:56) bang in the first place was because I was running an orgy and these people ran a train on me I think it was like 15 11
(1:30:02) guys or something that was a different that was a different a different or this yeah I isn't that a gang bang no org is
(1:30:07) like all genders gang bangs is all guys and let one go I mean it was like kind of a impromptu gang bang if you will in
(1:30:14) the middle of this orgy half a gang bang it I throw like non-consent orgies so you wear a wristband and people can do
(1:30:20) like whatever you want they want to you within a certain period of thing anyway so I was wearing The Wristband and just like threw me down it started it was
(1:30:25) like it was a train and it was [ __ ] fantastic afterwards I was like glowing
(1:30:30) I felt so good for days it was like I had done like a really good psychedelic and then I was like this is so amazing and so my partner saw that and he was
(1:30:37) like wow sounds like it was really good for you he's like so for your birthday I'm going to try and arrange like an even bigger one but I think like the
(1:30:42) logistics of the bigger one just like it the magic wasn't there sometimes that takes away from it I does AR Ariel here
(1:30:51) speaking of the mic you had a really big reaction to the did you want to say something eron I'm just like kind of intrigued
(1:30:58) like I've never heard of it before ging Bings honestly like good for you guys I don't know I'm just learning
(1:31:06) new stuff she's learning she's learning all right um wait so you've done
(1:31:12) multiple uh grape play orgies CNC yeah CNC consensual yeah I run a series how
(1:31:19) many have you done of these eight I think seven or eight yeah and so
(1:31:24) uh YouTube's a little tricky with it um I I understand it basically though um
(1:31:30) you describe yourself on Twitter as a wh Lord yes and a vex vex worker indeed um
(1:31:36) what is a wh Lord uh the Lord of [ __ ] you're the Lord of [ __ ] yes okay the
(1:31:41) Lord of I thought it was relatively self-explanatory M
(1:31:48) lady okay you're you're the Lord of them uh yeah I mean I I write guides on how
(1:31:53) to do it if like if a girl's interested getting into it you a horror guide yeah
(1:31:59) like like how to be the best [ __ ] it's hard to be a good wh how you even get into it it's hard like how do you stay
(1:32:04) safe I tried once just um you tried how was it I'm just joking um but uh okay so
(1:32:11) you you're kind of like the the Lord of [ __ ] yeah I'm kiding myself at this
(1:32:16) point um in Vex worker what's that are you a witch well I think people really get mad at me a lot for things that I
() 
(1:32:22) for a while I didn't know they were going to get mad at me before and now I've started to catch on um and so
(1:32:27) people seem to be very vexed by me they're vexed they are vexed why are they how are they vexed uh oh I think
(1:32:34) people are like horrified by a lot of like I ask a lot of like moral conundrum polls which I probably can't repeat on
(1:32:40) stream um but or like for example uh moral conundrum like uh can I have a
(1:32:47) moral conundrum yes oh can you say what well can I talk don't bring up the miners don't bring them no not it's not
(1:32:53) it's um um like like is beastiality wrong and are you a vegan you talked about this at dinner
(1:33:00) when we were um in Colorado H oh yeah oh yeah I did see some of your tweets on
(1:33:05) this uh it just seems like a little funny that we have different standards for uh like intercourse versus killing
(1:33:11) and eating like I know if someone were going to do one to me I would rather not be killed and eaten okay and so anyway this an example
(1:33:18) of uh people seem to get really mad at me for that one but I thought it was relatively straightforward sure uh and
(1:33:25) then let's see here you said you built a dating survey you picked the top guy from that you were not attracted to him
(1:33:31) but you brute forced through the first date uh you guys spent three days at
(1:33:36) Airbnb brute forced it um and You' forced yourself to have sex with him
(1:33:44) yeah that's my current partner oh that's your current uh for four years does that
(1:33:50) upset him does that upset you know like P sex was it P sex it was a bit of pity sex no I think it was curiosity sex I
(1:33:56) was like I should probably try it you forced yourself yeah I he he just scored I had a survey that was scored so people
(1:34:02) answer questions and then if the on the back end that I built it and then you get an output and then I contacted the
(1:34:08) top scorers and then he was like one of the very top scorers and so I was like date and I pointed I made a graph of the
(1:34:14) scores and pointed at him and he said sure 3 days in Airbnb and I was like great so I went to an Airbnb for 3 days
(1:34:20) which was the first time IID like seriously talked to him and then I was like well if I'm going to figure out if
(1:34:25) I should date you I should probably have sex with you I was not attracted to him at all he was really annoying to me at that time but he's much better now do
(1:34:32) you want kids uh I would like to have genetic Offspring genetic Offspring okay
(1:34:38) with with him or yeah well he doesn't want to it's a very long story that probably is not going to get
(1:34:44) communicated but I I think probably the world's going to end relatively soon uh
(1:34:50) and I think he's like working on that pretty hard to stop it I mean oh yeah I was like [ __ ] apocalypse uh he's
(1:34:57) trying to stop it the end of the world um oh I'm just curious because you said
(1:35:02) I feel like you can't if you do have kids you cannot tell them I wasn't feeling your dad at all like I wasn't
(1:35:09) into why can't I tell them that well you you could I definitely tell them that oh you'll definitely tell them that yeah if I did if I had them do you tell like
(1:35:16) he's not upset by that like but it's the truth I sure it's the truth but I mean
(1:35:22) it feels like it would be hurtful if the person who you're pain is just coming
(1:35:27) into contact with reality and then when you're in contact with it it doesn't hurt anymore I need LSD for this um but uh no I'm just kidding uh no it's just
(1:35:35) like you know what I mean like if I told if I was dating a girl and I was like
(1:35:40) BTW I thought you were ugly at first and I had to I like yeah I faked an orgasm I
(1:35:47) just but would you want to know that I had to like force myself to have sex with you like I feel feel like she would
(1:35:54) take it the wrong way you know what I mean I mean he told me that I wasn't that pretty once uh when I was trying to
(1:35:59) have a 10 you posted a tweet about it have it pull it up pull up the Tweet um yeah that was pretty rough I was like
(1:36:06) ow damn yeah like it's actually he just said you're not that pretty yeah he said I'm not that pretty because I was like
(1:36:12) I'm afraid that people you know how people like kind of tell each other girl you're so hot I'm like everybody's incentivized just say positive things
(1:36:17) about each other's appearance like I don't actually understand and I did actually run a a face rating survey so I
(1:36:23) could determine my attractivness and I'm a 4.6 so I'm in fact actually not that
(1:36:29) pretty interesting yeah you should uh we we should get you to do some like surveys for our podcast I no wait she's
(1:36:37) doing my survey first I will do both there we go we we have we've collected
(1:36:42) quite a bit of data from the show uh it's pretty inter really like what oh I mean nothing on the scale of what you're doing but simple things like uh total
(1:36:49) appearances like the breakdown of um like who's involved in sex work the amount of people who've canell who
(1:36:56) what's the percentages do you know uh I think it's about 15% of all the panelists have been involved in sex work
(1:37:02) or only fans or something like that um and uh yeah I'm trying to think if there's anything else age um
(1:37:09) relationship status the sort of thing so oh cool yeah do you have like in a spreadsheet um sort of yes it's very
(1:37:18) rudimentary though so we can talk after the show though and uh it'd be interesting to get some some stuff down
(1:37:24) um do we have her tweet pulled up all right so this is brutal uh and scroll down because this is like a quote tweet
() 
(1:37:30) in response to somebody else scroll down don't go too far though uh put us on the other side all right just just hide us
(1:37:36) for a sec all right so this is your response uh being a girl's boyfriend is all about
(1:37:42) committing to the bit that she is a 101 and the most beautiful woman you have ever seen scroll up and then you write
(1:37:48) can uh scroll up AI let me just have you read it in your voice uh one of my partners was like you're not that pretty
(1:37:54) during a tender moment I rolled over in the fetal position and groaned for like an hour and then he went and made me an I'm sorry card out of construction paper
(1:38:01) and markers and stickers okay so this is this is the guy who you told like you
(1:38:07) forced yourself to have sex with him and you weren't attracted to him yeah and you told him this yes how did he take
(1:38:13) that he was like oh he's just like oh no no reaction well I mean attracted to him now okay now you're attracted to him
(1:38:19) yeah how many like did you have to force having sex with him like multiple times or I think the six
(1:38:26) got better by about the sixth time the sixth time okay all right huh and now it's a best sex I've ever had in my life
(1:38:32) Li you got you got something or pin Oh I thought you it sounded because I because
(1:38:37) I don't think I would have given till the sixth time so I'm just impressed that if it wasn't good by the second I'm
(1:38:43) done well I think there are other benefits going for him like he was really high status in my community and I think that that's quite attractive and
(1:38:50) so if a guy is like really uh like uh interesting for other reasons um usually
(1:38:55) you can like be like all right I'm going to go make myself have sex with you because I'm interested in bonding with you and you say uh when you say your
(1:39:01) community what do you mean like CNC rationalist Community ration what is that it's uh do you have you heard of
(1:39:08) Les wrong less less wrong less wrong it's a long story I don't know how much time I want to take no it's a Blog it
(1:39:17) was a Blog it's written by Ellie owski about like how to think less wrong so it
(1:39:22) like covers a lot of cogn biases and like we do prediction markets I did a prediction Market when I was coming on
(1:39:27) this show of whether I'd regret it if you regret it yeah and it's said 27% 27% chance you would reg would regret it oh
(1:39:33) that's pretty good yeah it's not that bad pretty good not that bad how's it going so far little regret yeah no regret so far so far okay all right um
(1:39:41) so but yeah it's a lot of like how do you actually develop true beliefs about the world because a lot of the time when people are thinking things they're not
(1:39:47) like making like really concerted efforts to make their beliefs map onto reality so if you can like make it so that if it hurts if you're wrong that
(1:39:53) means you actually are incentivized to update in a way that most people are like really enjoy lying to themselves about a lot of things so you use a
(1:39:59) correspondence theory for truth um I don't know what that means well you just said that uh the
(1:40:06) truth is the thing which maps on to reality is that correct yes correspond
(1:40:12) that's correspondence theory okay um just moving on here you said that you study fetishes with an
(1:40:19) emphasis in gaps in sexuality between males and females you've collected what is probably the largest comprehensive data set on human sexuality in the world
(1:40:27) are you like published in any like journals or scientific like academic journals I don't get clearance by the IRB I have no academic Association or
(1:40:34) formal training so it's uh we I did there is one paper that is going through the things right now in conjunction with
(1:40:40) Jeffrey Miller um who's an academic and e pych but uh yeah I I did a survey that
(1:40:46) basically I designed to go viral and it did successfully go viral and now we have a total about 800,000 completed
(1:40:52) responses for a was a 40-minute survey of extremely exensive about human sexuality so there's a whole bunch of interesting
(1:40:58) stuff like if you want correlations about body count I have a whole bunch of data the kinds of people that have high body count versus low body count yeah no
(1:41:04) I looked at some of I didn't look at everything you've published but uh it's interesting stuff you said that there
(1:41:10) isn't isn't it true that often times and I saw some deleted tweets you can help me out with this but often times your
(1:41:16) sample sizes for these various surveys you do they're they're pre-loaded with tons of teenagers yes it's it's a
(1:41:22) primarily young I think the average age is 22 with like a median is a little bit lower than that isn't that a pretty
(1:41:27) biased sample size uh absolutely it's not a represent not representative of the general population but there are
() 
(1:41:33) ways to check I mean why should we take any of it seriously then like any of this data that's a great question
(1:41:39) actually so the majority of all published data in sex science is uh either equally or more so biased than
(1:41:45) what I have and also there's like methods of checking wait wait wait hang on let's start let's do a claim into
(1:41:51) time here before you get galoper around uh what is your demonstration or evidence that most sex scientific data
(1:41:58) is more biased than your data uh by biased I mean the selection effects cause it to be less uh representative
(1:42:04) than the general population like what uh generally it's uh you get like 30 to 4
(1:42:09) undergrads in a college is very common yeah but that's not a demonstration that most sex data is bias
(1:42:17) in comparison to years even if that was the case that would not be proof or evidence that more of it is bias than
(1:42:23) your own data uh you can I mean mostly it's just from reading a whole bunch of papers I just have read a bunch of
(1:42:29) papers and also talked a bunch of academics yeah but how's I mean how's
(1:42:34) that a demonstration though that most sex data is less biased than your sex data which is loaded with teenagers who
(1:42:41) are uh definitely not a good sample size of the general population at all uh you
(1:42:48) yes so there's there like really interesting things about like how to balance selection effects uh to develop
(1:42:54) like good extrapolation so one you can also pay random samples to sort of spot check to see in what ways that your
(1:43:01) sample deviates from the normal population um which I do this often I will if there are things that seem particularly unusual I will go spot
(1:43:07) check to see exactly how different my sample is yeah that's just a basic control like these are all using the
(1:43:13) that basic control I I would assume would be present in any professional SE
(1:43:18) unfortunately is not it really isn't I know I know it's shocking uh but most sex research what's the percentage where
(1:43:25) basic controls are not being used in sociological studies which are being done at universities uh I have not a
(1:43:33) made a spreadsheet out of all of the studies that I have read and whether or not they have controls yeah so you don't
(1:43:39) have anything backing this up at all what do you have a spreadsheet I don't need one you're the CL you do actually
(1:43:45) how many how many papers on sex research have you read if let's say I made a spreadsheet right now and I just put all
(1:43:50) of this is [ __ ] and then mapped out that it's all [ __ ] what would that have to do with anything that we're talking about wouldn't I I would not
(1:43:58) need a spreadsheet in order to question basic methodology when you make these bold claims like oh my my uh studies the
(1:44:06) ones that I'm doing actually are less biased than ones which are done by professional universities and I say wow
(1:44:11) that's a really bold claim I'm sure you can demonstrate that you go no actually I can't I actually can't demonstrate
(1:44:17) that it's like well then why should any of that be taken seriously um I've just read a whole
(1:44:22) bunch of studies and the vast majority of them like the biggest data sample
(1:44:27) size I've read maybe is like 8,000 people um and generally for example if
(1:44:33) you're looking at BDSM I was like oh I wonder what uh research has been done on BDSM and the kinds of people who like
(1:44:38) BDSM compared to my sample for example um and most of the research is for
(1:44:44) example people will go to BDSM forums and then they post a link to the survey this is academics this is the published
(1:44:50) research on this it it's not great this one this is one I'm giving an example of something that is very common for all
(1:44:56) I'm not listen I'm not looking for your outlier examples of when they're not outliers
(1:45:02) they're you know you don't have a spread right you need to have a spreadsheet to show that all the control basically all
(1:45:08) of the studies on BDSM that I can find it's possible that there's a bunch of them I haven't found that all of them my
(1:45:14) seriously have good control PL Che for peer review study really uh not the not like the thing is you don't necessarily
(1:45:20) have to right it depends on the kinds of things that you're measuring it's very specific on are going to be the controls
(1:45:26) are going to be variable based I need you guys to both make a closing statement on this I don't really find
(1:45:31) this particular material to the no good reason so I went through a bunch of your data right and since it's preloaded with
(1:45:38) essentially teenagers on Twitter teenagers in other places who are overloading the sample size not
(1:45:44) representative of anything like nothing there's really no good reason to believe at all even if it were hang on even if
(1:45:50) it were the case that it work true that it's still less biased than what is is
(1:45:56) uh being put forward by sociologists and sex studies facilities somewhere or universities that still wouldn't prove
(1:46:02) your data's good even if all their data was wrong still wouldn't prove your data's good uh I agree it would just prove its bias uh but it selection
(1:46:10) effects not necessarily biased but in general I agree and this is why there's lots of techniques that we can use to
(1:46:15) determine exactly the ways in which it is not representative um and it's a long story but I can go into all of those
(1:46:20) techniques that I have
(1:46:27) sorry he said it was a oh he asked me to do closing statement so I thought that I supposed to time time permitting we can
(1:46:32) maybe come back to the uh discourse about validity of uh surveys and
(1:46:39) self-reporting and so forth but uh I do need to move things on um but you did a
(1:46:44) uh there you said there's a about a 1.5 time ratio gap of dominance for submission in both directions you mean
(1:46:51) like in relationships or no in general like if you are you talking about BDSM uh like for when I asked the men which
(1:46:57) was like 250,000 people or something um this holds true even if you delete all of the teenagers and you look at older
(1:47:03) people um but uh the people who report like around 1.5 as many women report
(1:47:09) being into submission as there are men who report being into dominance and there are also around 1.5 uh times the
(1:47:15) amount of men interested in submission as there are women interested in the amount of dominance it's just the absolute numbers are lower which is
(1:47:21) really fascinating okay interesting um there's a few more notes but I need to get through a couple things first here
(1:47:27) guys uh so we guys I need to shout out some people who made some contributions first via this looks like uh venmo

(1:48:13) guys also like the video while uh you're what of course while you're watching if you're enjoying the stream also go to
(1:48:20) twitch.tv/ whatever drop us a follow and a Prime sub if you have one if you have Amazon Prime you can link it to your
(1:48:25) Twitch quick for easy way to support the show every single month and then we have couple messages coming in here via
(1:48:32) streamlabs we have a quick question from Lucas uh let's see Lucas says question
(1:48:38) from from wife if husband is one impeccably competent virtuous and moral
(1:48:45) two he's in New York City big law partner attorney uh three seven figures so bread winner four 6'4 in shape
(1:48:54) five uh oh question from wife I get to be the stay-at-home mom should I submit
(1:48:59) to his authority unconditionally I guess going around the table if you want to answer that question I don't understand it was so
(1:49:05) basically it's a question from a woman from the wife so her husband is um is
(1:49:12) awesome attorney High earner tall attractive physically attractive she gets to stay
(1:49:19) home she doesn't have to work uh stay at home mom uh should should she submit to
(1:49:24) his authority unconditionally going around the table unconditionally unconditionally I'm afraid that if I just I'm going to take
(1:49:31) so many issues with the definitions of words that everybody's going to be annoyed unconditionally what do you what
(1:49:37) do you mean I absolutely love getting into the definition of words in well we already talked about this particular
(1:49:42) conversation for quite bit and see if we agree or disagree I mean it's condition on him being him right so like if we
(1:49:48) enter a transhumanist future where you slowly change all the atoms in his body until he no longer himself you cannot
(1:49:54) unconditionally be only one person question H it to a transhumanist
(1:49:59) future it is conditional right there is no condition under which one would not
(1:50:05) submit and I just find that anyway this is why I'm saying we should uh people will be annoyed well then well then the
(1:50:10) answer would be no yeah yes yeah so then I don't know why you needed the word to
(1:50:16) find if you already knew that the answer was no that's really weird it almost seems like you're being pedantic I am a
(1:50:21) weird person no no no that's not weird that's that's pedantry and the thing is like if it is
(1:50:28) the case that you know what's being as and then you purposely office gate right that's what I was talking about earlier
(1:50:34) about low tier just so you know that's what that means oh thanks for letting me know I'm low tier you're welcome at
(1:50:41) least your philosophy is unconditionally no okay Lily what about you no no no not
(1:50:49) unconditionally nope I will say say yes in the sense of
(1:50:56) if he's you can always say your peace you say your peace he can compromise and and
(1:51:02) if he does respect you and love you he will change his answer to at least compromise if he doesn't change the
(1:51:08) answer to compromise then unfortunately like you can walk out tomorrow I guess
(1:51:13) and then you're just going to be homeless sure what about you no I think
(1:51:19) all relationships have rules and if someone is breaking those rules then
(1:51:25) they have to reconsider the relationship altogether okay all right thank you Lucas for the message we have meet the
(1:51:30) Kaiser says what's up Brian quite the panel good back and forth earlier Candice and Andrew is the best team up
(1:51:37) I've seen on the internet since Eva evaa and Abella danger okay all right uh have
(1:51:44) fun or cheers whatever they say in the UK thank you Candice had a bunch of really mean things that she said about
(1:51:50) me even though I've never talked about or discuss her or even knew anything about her she said some really mean things entally the video Brian I would
(1:51:57) actually like her to respond to all the mean things that she said she made a lot of horrible allegations too that weren't true I just I don't know if is this
() 
(1:52:05) something you want to get into or I mean if that's what you want would like I would like to get into it because you said some pretty mean things about me
(1:52:12) and I didn't what did I ever do to you I didn't kick your puppy or anything well no but I think you would probably agree
(1:52:17) and correct me if I'm wrong but if you decide to be on the internet and make content then you're going to be subject to other people having an opinion on it
(1:52:24) no yeah the great thing is though is that when I make commentary on what other people say I don't lie and do my research you li multiple times what did
(1:52:31) I lie about me well you you made a here's the most serious allegation you
(1:52:36) said that I had a belief that if men cheat uh and women cheat that it's okay for men to cheat and not okay for women
(1:52:43) to cheat or I'm sorry vice versa it's okay for men to cheat not okay for women right I don't know if it was not only
(1:52:49) have I literally never said that once the opposite it in fact emphatically you
(1:52:54) also pulled me in with red pillars of which I'm not I'm a Christian ethicist right you lied over and over and over
(1:53:01) because you didn't do any research whatsoever and I would like you to answer this to like why you think it's okay to lie about people on the internet
(1:53:07) who have never done anything to you well I I certainly didn't lie and you'd have to pull up the exact tweet where I'm
(1:53:12) naming you specifically I don't need the tweet I have the clip I sent it to Brian we can I know but it has to it has to be
(1:53:17) addressing who I'm talking about because you've had multiple say my name Andrew you say my name Andrew and then go
(1:53:23) through and accuse me of these things I do I say Andrew yes I don't know okay we can pull it
(1:53:31) and I'm I mean I need to PRI Andrew I you sent it to me 20 minutes before the
(1:53:37) show I didn't have time to review it I have to pre-screen it before I show it live um were you talking about Andrew
(1:53:44) Tate no it could have been Andrew no it could absolutely have been Andrew Tate and then there have been well hold on
(1:53:49) because you're asking a question I'm not being allowed to ask ever unless Andrew Tate is it it could have been whatever
(1:53:55) but here's I honestly I didn't know your name until I was coming on the show to be honest so if I said Andrew it could
(1:54:01) have been me misspeaking cuz there have been other men that were hosting on here and then it was a clip that I don't even
(1:54:06) know how old it was um I think it was a different Studio as well it was referring to one of the male like either
(1:54:12) hosts or guests and I'm not sure what his role was okay so well then why would I say it about you if you didn't say it there was
(1:54:18) a clip on this podcast that's that's what's in question I don't know why you would well then I would have to find the
(1:54:24) clip in question so that's not like you don't have to cuz I sent it no I'm I'm saying I would have to oh my goodness
(1:54:30) this isn't a conversation I'm saying I would have to find the clip that I was commentate on commentating on because it
(1:54:36) is possible that maybe I said the wrong name and if that's true I would apologize there my intention is not to
(1:54:41) lie but there was absolutely a clip that I saw on this podcast and I again I don't know if it was a a host or a guest
(1:54:49) and the argument was that if um if a I don't think it was you I think it was a younger host um and maybe he wasn't a
(1:54:56) host maybe he was a guest but he he was saying that if uh man was abusing his
(1:55:01) wife that it was the wife's duty to seek counseling within the church and not divorce but if the woman cheated that that would be grounds for divorce like
(1:55:08) that was the clip that was circulating is it possible that it got edited and what I watched was not true and that's what I'm saying if I was prepared I
(1:55:14) could come with the clip that I was commentating on and if the clip was inaccurate or if I miss said the name I
(1:55:20) will apologize without like any embarrassment whatsoever cuz I don't want to missp or lie that's not my
(1:55:25) intention but I can't do that because I don't have the clip I don't even have a phone yeah unfortunately I can't uh
(1:55:32) debunk this if there's if if we if we can't play it but what I am going to say is this is like you it definitely was an
(1:55:39) attribution and a mischaracterization of anything I've ever said and uh and total total
(1:55:46) nonsense uh so yeah I did I did want to uh get into it but if we can't get into
(1:55:51) it we can't get into yeah and again I don't think I was saying it about you cuz I don't know the guy's name he's like cleancut younger
(1:55:59) dude they could have just B me without a beard you know no no I'm sure it wasn't you because it the guy like he looked
(1:56:05) like he was in his 20s okay and his name was Andrew I don't
(1:56:11) know that I again I don't have the clip so I can't say it and if I said Andrew it could have been me just using the wrong name because I I literally had my
(1:56:18) producer like send me little bios of you guys before I came here quote those guys
(1:56:23) uh who host that show right they like nothing better than to be in a room so
(1:56:29) that they can abuse women and you'll never see them debating with men well there yeah and you would say
(1:56:35) that there have been there have been good conversations on the internet with you that are treating women with respect
(1:56:41) like that's what this podcast is known for is really reasonable conversations where everyone is mutually talking to
(1:56:46) each other with respect yeah that has not let's let's assume for a second everybody's always fighting on here and
(1:56:52) yelling at each other and screaming at each other so what that has nothing to do with your claim that the men on here would much rather be sitting across from
(1:56:59) women and debating with women because they're essentially you're referring that they're a bunch of cowards and here's the thing that's so funny is like
(1:57:05) I actually am quite famous for debating men around the world especially on these topics right um it's in in some ways
(1:57:14) right uh I've been accused of of uh it's not dignified enough for me to give you
(1:57:20) guys even the time of day yet I think that that is actually a very
(1:57:25) mean-spirited thing to say I think that you guys deserve if you have arguments and things like that to have them heard
(1:57:31) out I that almost seems like it's anti- misogynistic to me and that you have a misogynistic position well I don't
(1:57:37) believe that that's true at all I don't think that you're genuinely here to like listen or change opinions on anything
(1:57:43) and because that doesn't make good cont thousands upon thousands of opinions it may not change yours but remember that
(1:57:48) these uh clips and Views go out to millions of people and the idea is not
(1:57:53) and this is every debate which exists by the way the idea is not necessarily to change the opponent's mind the opponent
(1:57:59) is there to represent their worldview and I'm here to represent mine it is not necessarily to change your mind though
(1:58:04) that has happened too It ultimately is to put our World Views against each other and see which one makes more sense
(1:58:10) at least to the general public so yeah I think I I've changed tens of thousands
(1:58:16) or hundreds of thousands of Mines even sure but I mean to count to push back on the idea that you would be accepting of
(1:58:22) having men on the show there have been multiple times and for example there was a Navy SEAL friend of mine that was
(1:58:28) supposed to come on the show with a girl um to do the debate flew in and was
() 
(1:58:34) turned down at the door after they paid for all of their expenses and I've heard several of those stories um and then I
(1:58:41) was supposed to come on with a friend too who is former special ops he couldn't come on um because he ended up
(1:58:47) having to shoot a movie we were going to replace him and they're like actually no we don't want any men and and if you
(1:58:52) want you could bring a girlfriend so I mean that's not entirely honest either de many hold on Andrew let me address
(1:58:59) that um so let's address your first point who who came on who was turned
(1:59:05) away from the door literally never happened totally fake news but who was it oh I don't have the name it was like
(1:59:11) a friend of a friend gu it's a seal that's going around B we booked a Navy
(1:59:16) SEAL so it didn't happen so it didn't happen yeah I mean so we you're claiming we booked in Navy SEAL he showed up at
(1:59:24) the door that's what I heard he was scheduled to be on the show with a a female yeah female and he was turned away yeah this is entirely fake news um
(1:59:32) do you know who the girl was no and then I also heard and then I also heard from like one degree of way um and I'm not
(1:59:38) going to like say his name but that he's had friends come on the show and like that their mic was muted the whole time
(1:59:43) and or that the content gets edited in a way to like make them look well hold on let's we can address some of those
(1:59:49) different arguments but let's start with the one of us turning a Navy SEAL away at the door first off um are you sure he
(1:59:57) was booked because sometimes women will show up with a dude no I'm not and maybe that was misund um like girls will show
(2:00:06) up with like a plus one that wasn't cleared by us and we're like the only people in the who we allow in the
(2:00:12) building have to be scheduled to be on the show um sometimes girls will bring their boyfriends and they'll try to like
(2:00:19) oh can I hop on the show we've I don't even I've don't even think I've talked
(2:00:24) to a Navy Seal in any and I do all the guest booking I do all the guest booking okay so I'm very close and familiar to
(2:00:31) who does and does not come on the show this is entirely fabricated okay so I
(2:00:36) don't know why some Navy SEAL you'd assume this is a person of good moral character is lying about being booked on
(2:00:44) the show I sent you that particular accusation she makes it in the clip I saw the clip this person yeah this
(2:00:50) person you know um showed up at the door everything was paid for they were invited this type of thing totally
(2:00:56) fabricated absolutely facated and here's why here's why I take issue with it right to be to be to be fair um why is
(2:01:04) it that I'm not allowed to ask you like did you even did you ever even reach out to Brian to confirm that did you ever do
(2:01:10) any research on it before you decided that you'd put that out there to thousands upon thousands of people you
(2:01:16) didn't even bother right you didn't even like bother to even ask about it you just put it out there and it's like so
(2:01:21) of course I consider that to be slanderous and lying and nonsense right because I mean did you do any due
(2:01:28) diligence to verify how many episodes do you have men on that have opposing opinions so it's just pattern
(2:01:34) recognition so if me saying that you don't have men on debate you don't have men on debate look at the table right
(2:01:39) now you don't have men on to debate how's that relevant to the actual false accusation no it's relevant to saying that you don't have men on to debate and
(2:01:46) we've had Destiny Destiny who's like one of the strongest left one person so it's almost like that exception is actually
(2:01:51) proving the rule like if it was normal that you would have like I mean that's that's the format of the show sure that's yeah exactly though so
(2:01:59) why but why is that the format does but why is it always just women but okay how does that pertain it's not always just
(2:02:06) women it's usually just women the other thing is the exception hold on we brought on bivo well hold on bivo bivo
(2:02:12) is not I've done I've done a multitude of debates on whatever between myself and men just by ourselves in the studio
(2:02:18) in fact and there's been other times where there's been men on these panels and I'm happy to debate them I debate with men all over the world use STS
(2:02:25) right what percent are men we need a how how does that pertain to the false accusation like that's a
(2:02:31) totally R yeah it's a you're I don't know if it's Shifting the GL post or whatever but um I mean i' I almost be
(2:02:39) prepared to do a wager here if you can provide any sort of evidence mind you I've spoken to thousands of people right
(2:02:46) I'm so confident that this is totally fabricated and made up that a Navy SEAL show up at our door we had him on
(2:02:53) schedule and then we're like oh actually no [ __ ] you you spent all this money to come here never happened I mean show me
(2:03:00) the evidence show me the I'm happy to inquire about it for sure show me the proof I will pay you know what do you
(2:03:06) want to do a wager on this I'm ready to do wer no I'm not betting cuz I mean I have no idea I'm I don't have the game
(2:03:13) he's just he's just he's just joking around right we're on YouTube G Brian would never make a wager what he's
(2:03:18) saying is is like he's just so confident in that that you know he was being a bit
(2:03:24) tongue and cheek there but ultimately that's why that's why I wanted to address this because I'm like well okay
(2:03:31) like how many Fabrications has this uh girl made about this podcast and about its host that are just completely not
(2:03:38) true but then they get out of the ethos like they are true well no and then so anecdotally speaking obviously that that
(2:03:44) doesn't say anything at scale but um I think the first time I was invited on the show was probably like 2 or 3 years
(2:03:50) ago and it was in response to a clip that I had going was called canceled weekly with Gerard Michaels and Mickey G
(2:03:57) and the response was to have me come on but not the other two co-hosts that were male and so that I'll look at the
(2:04:04) message history and yeah I don't know if it was to me or Gerard if like there was a group I'm not sure um but like they
(2:04:11) the invitation was extended to them and then when JT was supposed to come and then that got cancelled then the
(2:04:18) response was you got canel by him just be clear we had you and him yeah not
(2:04:24) canceled by him or I'm sorry not canceled by you by him yeah absolutely so we were prepared to have him and you
(2:04:29) on the show he cancelled and then we were like well do you still want to come fine you didn't want to do it but um
(2:04:36) yeah no I reached out you reacted to this clip of me having a back and forth with this obnoxious woman who came on
(2:04:43) intentionally to troll the show and I had to kick her off the show um but as it pertains to the kind of initial reach
(2:04:49) out which was back in February of 2024 um you said you wanted to be a
(2:04:56) guest but the stipulation is the guys have to be able to join and I said we could accommodate excuse me we could
(2:05:01) accommodate one of your mail guests uh so we didn't outright deny them but I
(2:05:06) was like well we can have one we typically only like to book two people together okay it's just kind of our poliy here's here's my further challenge
(2:05:12) you can get anybody who you want uh who has issues with any of my views who's a
(2:05:18) man you can stack that whole panel I'll fly out there and debate all of them in person happily M and here's exactly what
(2:05:24) will happen nothing they'll all lose the debate I'll laugh hysterically that'll be it's a perfect day like go go let him
(2:05:31) know okay yeah and just to like actually and if you want to verify this but in March I
(2:05:39) said we could accommodate one of your male co-hosts and I asked if you primarily wanted to debate the kickoff
(2:05:44) of that one girl who came on and trolled uh to which he didn't respond I checked in a week later checking in checked in
(2:05:50) two weeks later hey just wanted to follow up one last time see if you're still interested did not hear from you until September of
(2:05:57) 2024 uh wanted to see if they're still an invitation JT he wants to come on um
(2:06:04) and then uh let's see we locked you in for or wait hold on when did we lock you
(2:06:12) in for uh oh we were in a group chat so I don't seea we were in a group chat so I
(2:06:19) don't see the and then we shifted the conversation there we had you sched at some time in the fall he canell a week
(2:06:27) prior because of a movie I don't know whatever not a big deal people have to reschedule not a big thing but I think
(2:06:34) that would indicate that we were prepared to have a m a male guest title the clip title is says Andrew Wilson
(2:06:41) cringe just so you know my name is Andrew Wilson and there's never been to
(2:06:46) my knowledge another Andrew Wilson on the just letting you know that the C is
(2:06:51) called Andrew Wilson cringe it sure seems like you are referencing me if
(2:06:58) it's called Andrew Wilson I'm just that's the editor unless my name my mouth said your name which I don't think
(2:07:04) it did it did I mean it did it said Andrew and then says Andrew Wilson cringe okay so I might I was probably
(2:07:11) talking about Tate and then the editors probably put your name I have no idea cuz I don't have the clip why
(2:07:17) referencing Tate I don't don't know I don't have the clip I don't have the clip
(2:07:25) okay okay um look sorry
(2:07:30) guys I mean I don't want to linger too long on The Meta conversation because it's you
(2:07:36) know whatever um but and wait just really one thing yeah just Andrew he wants to pull up the clip um you said
(2:07:43) that there were like other people who like we kicked them out or like we like
(2:07:49) denied them at the door that's what heard yeah from like a a friend we denied them
(2:07:55) at the my friend's friend and like he didn't see he didn't seem like a a liar
(2:08:01) so yeah wait so just and just so I understand the situation correctly we had him on schedule like he showed up
(2:08:07) that was what was no but he showed up and we like that's what I was told that's what I was told that it was only
(2:08:13) like she the only the woman was allowed on so yeah never happened never happened if you can I can't argue cuz I don't
(2:08:19) have any I don't have anything so I'm not arguing feel like we're like trying to make an argument when I'm saying I I don't have an argument no I'm not really
(2:08:25) arguing with you I just want to clear clear the air because um I think it would be kind of
(2:08:31) rude to like invite somebody on they spend money to come here and then we're just like oh [ __ ] you we've never done that it
(2:08:38) sounds crazy that would be super fun we've never done that never I mean uh I
(2:08:44) mean there's there's like opposition I give you a story of a time where there's been regret like Ryan's like maybe I
(2:08:51) shouldn't have invited this person but man they spent this money to come out here so I'm going to let them on anyway
(2:08:57) right like that's more Brian's attitude than the alternative MH yeah um anyways I don't know why
(2:09:05) people are making up these these lies um I'd be curious to see I mean you don't
(2:09:11) have to show me but obviously not now on the podcast but I'd be curious to see the actual uh basis for these claims
(2:09:19) because it's completely dubious and false um but and also like I I mean I don't
(2:09:27) know anyways whatever why we just play the clip and then we'll move on to the next
() 
(2:09:32) thing what who [ __ ] this is not I'm talking about go ahead just play it and
(2:09:39) I'm pretty sure speak on this is if a woman cheats or she's Unfaithful because her man's not he should her so a GU
(2:09:45) allowed to exit the relationship and um her behavior is no is never justifiable if he cheats nothing but
(2:09:50) compassion she deserved it just super hypocritical Beauty sex is terrible but also don't weaponize it so it's a this and thing and you have to check in with
(2:09:55) it and I'm curious how long any of these people have been married and how many children they have and how happy they are because there's also this idea that no matter what you have to say in a
(2:10:01) relationship especially if there's kids and I don't know that that's true I think that they deserve to see their parents in love and if you can't make that happen I think there are way worse
(2:10:06) things by sticking it out for the kids um that's something I've kind of come around on as well so I've uh I don't
(2:10:12) know I hate this I hate this person so bad we were actually supposed to go um me and a friend go on the show I don't think it's going to happen because we
(2:10:17) did some due diligence and they in the past have brought on a Navy SEAL he flies all the way to Northern in California to do the show knock knock
(2:10:22) actually we don't want to have you on and it's because if you bring on a man especially in Alpha these guys cannot stand it they cannot stand it all they
(2:10:27) want to do is sit across from women and Bully them and Badger them and dunk on them and it's just an excuse to um exercise actual sexism and I don't use
(2:10:33) that word a lot because I don't think that it is as prevalent as it used to be and as much of a problem but with this community it absolutely is um please don't get your relationship advice from
(2:10:39) there like look for healthy healed whole masculine Role Models this is not it if you are blaming half of the population for all of your problems and they ANW
(2:10:45) it's always just women it's always just eag girls it's always whatever you might be the problem buddy so so this was on Duty sex this wasn't
(2:10:52) on um the beating or the divorce or cheating I think that was in reference to a a duty sex
(2:10:59) tweet yeah I got it it was that's not what we were talking about earlier though we weren't talking about it's
(2:11:05) referencing me and the position is actually incorrect again the referent is wrong do we have your Tweet on duty sex
(2:11:12) incorrect what's that do we have the tweet that was on duty sex yeah so this is a what you're referencing is we're
(2:11:19) talking from a Christian paradigm so from a Christian not it's not a statement that women have or don't have
(2:11:25) duty sex it's a statement from the position of the Christian or the Muslim Paradigm or let's say you know X
(2:11:31) Paradigm that within that Paradigm there is a duty that women have to fulfill their in the the obligation of the
(2:11:38) marriage and part of that would be sex yeah yeah yeah it just seems like we're
(2:11:43) talking about multiple like we're talking about different things because initially we were talking about um abuse and cheating and divorce and then now
(2:11:49) we're circling to dir to duty sex and then when I see Rachel Wilson in the
(2:11:54) comments um I don't make my titles I don't think anyone does so when it says that I'm I'm that's not me so I don't
(2:12:02) know yeah I know but she said you did your due diligence I did we did our due diligence we checked into this and the
(2:12:08) whole thing's [ __ ] what due diligence did you do I'm commenting on a tweet on duty sex that's what I was
(2:12:14) doing yeah no no no you said we did our due diligence when it came to the Navy SEAL and this type of thing oh my due diligence was asking reference is that I
(2:12:22) trusted so I mean why you ask Brian wouldn't that be your due diligence well no it wouldn't because if I don't
(2:12:28) believe that he's an honest right but we but we've no cuz we've never met before and all I've seen is like a wa can I ask
(2:12:33) you one yeah yeah can I ask you one question well no I'm I every time you ask me a question I get cut off and then
(2:12:39) if I try to talk then you guys are like no let me finish talk way more than we have just so you know but go
(2:12:45) ahead I was you're asking what my due diligence was and I was saying that I asked people that had said that they
(2:12:51) were either on the show came on the show they experience so it's people that I would know or trust so to reach out to
(2:12:57) someone that I already kind of see as a position of being in an adversarial position like there's not really any
(2:13:03) there's not trust built so if I you say something I don't know you or your character so I mean just one question
(2:13:08) though did you hear it directly from the said Navy SEAL I can't say I'm not like
(2:13:14) sometimes throwing people under the bus you a friend told you that they knew somebody who knew a Navy SEAL like was
(2:13:20) it I can't cuz it's going to give people away I know I'm sorry but it's not I'm not asking who it is I'm just asking did
(2:13:26) you hear it from the person I know but the line of questioning is going to like throw certain people under the bus that I'm not I mean they throw me under the
(2:13:32) bus but that's fine whatever um in any case um don't even like reporters when
(2:13:39) they a story that they're commenting on contact the source and verify it like
(2:13:46) just ask him hey did this even happen like how hard would that have if it's due diligence like how hard would have
(2:13:51) actually been to just say hey did this actually happen I guess we disagree on how I
(2:13:56) should have approached it and that's fine well yeah I mean I I'm guessing that you would not appreciate me putting
(2:14:03) a video out to hundreds of thousands of people which was filled with besmirching lies about you if I didn't do my quote
(2:14:10) due diligence and maybe like I would have just DMD you i' would have been like hey is this actually true like is
(2:14:15) this actually what's what's going on and then I get the other side of the story right I'm sure you would actually appreciate that more wouldn't you I I
(2:14:21) mean I would absolutely but if I have full trust in someone else and they tell me something and they've done nothing to
(2:14:26) allude to the fact that like I need to be doubting what they're saying then like why wouldn't I believe them I
(2:14:34) don't because you did your due diligence I guess that's what that's what it means right but anyway all right I mean also
(2:14:41) just to like I guess provide you with an opportunity to potentially even verify the story like if you want to get up and
(2:14:48) like text the individual and be like hey is is this like do you have any evidence for this like what were the ask and then
(2:14:55) I can ask if he's willing for me to share it sure I could do that I'm happy to I mean I feel like it would be
(2:15:01) important for Navy SEAL to like that seems kind of like a position of ver uh I don't know
(2:15:09) Integrity honor like should he should clear this up I agree I think you should
(2:15:16) clear it up yeah I agree with that I don't know that seems fair yeah I'm willing to I'm willing text the person
(2:15:22) yeah that seem that seems reasonable but um I mean I can tell you uh yeah just tot I'm not trying to
(2:15:30) argue I'm willing totally fine yeah that's totally fine but uh and you said there were like other people who also got turned away I was curious about that
(2:15:36) too same it was the same person the same not the same individual like the same person like was putting
(2:15:43) feelers out and they've had um I don't know the girls names but like a bunch of
(2:15:48) like their girlfriends have come on and like they were sharing stories with um with him and then like there was a
(2:15:55) couple stories where guys got turned away but it could have been what you were saying right where they weren't approved and they weren't supposed to be on the show in the first place there I
(2:16:00) mean we get uh dozens of messages a day of people requesting to be on the show
(2:16:06) so when it comes to yeah but I mean we turn people down if they DM us hey can I come on the show we send them a very
(2:16:12) thoughtful message like we don't just like most people just ignore DMs like that we every single person who DMS us
(2:16:19) even if we're not interested in having them on the show we say hey unfort something like unfortunately at this time we um you know we uh can't have you
(2:16:27) on it's a little more diplomatic than that but can't have you on the show but we'll we'll keep your DMs if anything
(2:16:33) changes we'll be sure to reach out so we turn people down like in the DMS but
(2:16:38) we've never had somebody like booked to be on the show and then we like they
(2:16:44) come to the studio at the door uh don't really nah you can't be on it never has
(2:16:50) happened happened ever hasn't happened to a male hasn't happened to any women
(2:16:55) sure I appreciate you clarifying like I said I'm happy you know what there was one woman who she showed up unannounced
(2:17:02) with a service animal it was like a Chihuahua that [ __ ]
(2:17:08) was not a service animal and I was like and it was barking it was barking and
(2:17:14) normally we would try to accommodate somebody with a service animal but it was clearly not a service animal it was
(2:17:20) not trained to um to do a certain task
(2:17:25) MH and he was barking which would not be reasonable it would not be a reasonable accommodation like we can't we're
(2:17:30) recording audio we can't have a barking down dog in the studio so in that
(2:17:36) instance we did turn her away although we did offer her like could some could she came with a friend I was like can
(2:17:41) your friend watch the dog that's the only instance where we're just like we can't have the barking dog in the studio
(2:17:49) and we turned her down that's the only that's come to my that we've ever turned anybody way and for
(2:17:56) good reason mhm but yeah again all right whatever yeah
(2:18:04) um oh um we have a couple chats unless
(2:18:09) Andrew you wanted to was there more there or I don't know yeah I did just want to point out like I do have a video
(2:18:14) in front of me you have my tweet up right that's the reference you're definitely talking about me but you're Mis you're you're literally
(2:18:21) misappropriating the position even in the Tweet then you go on to say that basically Andrew is a beta male don't
(2:18:28) listen to him don't listen to these guys they're awful they don't know blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah right
(2:18:33) but the thing is is like when you're talking about viewpoints you're talking about from the view of right so if I was
(2:18:40) going to reference a view that you had and say from your view is XYZ true why
(2:18:46) is it true I understand why and then I would always make the reference to the Christian world I'd say here's why it's true from from the perspective here you
(2:18:53) would you would then go maybe back and forth and you could say hey you know the Christian view is wrong and here's why etc etc in this case though you didn't
(2:19:01) even refence that that that the Tweet was from the view of the Christian
(2:19:07) reference it yeah right but again due diligence do you know that you could have just dueil hey what what what's
(2:19:14) this meshing up so many things in this one argument so we started with um me
(2:19:19) talking about the um about the clip I thought we were talking about a totally different clip initially when we first
() 
(2:19:25) started this interaction so I thought we that's why I thought I was thinking well um Rachel is saying that I'm like
(2:19:32) intentionally lying I'm saying I didn't know which clip we were talking about it's not intentional I thought we were
(2:19:37) talking about a younger like that one younger co-host that I think you used to have talking about cheating and abuse
(2:19:42) specifically in regards to divorce and then the discrepancy there that was a totally different clip that I'm now
(2:19:47) realizing we wer no I'm just establishing that I'm not I'm not intentionally lying there's just confusion as to what content we're
(2:19:53) talking about moving on to the Tweet about um Duty sex if you're talking about this and there was more context
(2:19:59) like obviously things get taken the wrong way in a tweet so if there's like more interpretation that you have in
(2:20:05) regard to duty sex happy to hear whatever your take is on that the way that I read that tweet was that
(2:20:11) basically from a Christian view from a Christian view why well it could be Christian husbands wives hang on wives and husbands have a duty to sleep with
(2:20:18) each other from a Christian view yes no and I would agree with you can find this in Paul when he's talking about
(2:20:23) depriving right depriving each other sexually he says that's a nogo Christian view there's counseling which revolves
(2:20:29) around this specifically that that neither party is to deprive the other party of this thing there's no if ANS or
(2:20:36) buts about it this is not something that um I I even think is a controversial
(2:20:41) view right but it's being mischaracterized here and the reason you're mischaracterizing it is because
(2:20:46) you're trying to make it seem like Andrew Wilson's a monster and what he's trying to do is say that women have an
(2:20:52) obligation to have sex at the demand of their husband and it's like well that's not only such a mischaracterization but
(2:20:59) we could have cleared it up in 5 seconds you could have just asked and I would have been like here's actually what's going on you know what you're doing when
(2:21:04) you're tweeting too which is why you're successful and why you have a big c account and why you get so much
(2:21:09) engagement so like there is a little bit of that edge when you are going to Tweet so it's not like I just fell into this
(2:21:16) tweet and intentionally misrepresented you and it was just it was like a blame and mischaracterization what you're
(2:21:22) saying is that it was a bay tweet you f no I'm saying that you're very good at what you do I'm saying you're very good
(2:21:27) at what you do and you're good at ruffling feathers and you know that people like could have fallen for the
(2:21:32) bait though if you had done your D we're not doing du diligence on a tweet sir
(2:21:38) why not because it's a tweet right it's black and white text right there and if you do something that oh it's black and
(2:21:44) white now there's more context well no there's not there's not context well now that you have like more um characters
(2:21:50) available but there's not especially if there's a shorter tweet right you want it left open to into interpretation
(2:21:56) that's the whole point good job it worked due diligence would be like wait
(2:22:01) what did you mean by this right no because I do got to move it on I do got I do got to move it on it was um but uh
(2:22:08) here I got to do a couple chats and then also uh here we'll do uh a couple shout

(2:35:02) you should do a uh what is it is it the Kinks living on a thin line uh it goes uh all the stories have
(2:35:10) been told of kings of day of kings and days of old but there's no England now
(2:35:16) all the wars that were won and lost somehow don't seem to matter very much their castles have burned anyways
(2:35:24) feel like you're talking riddles it's basically saying like England was this uh great place andoun not great country
(2:35:30) andoun it's and this was back in the 80s they were wow like damn they ruined

(2:35:59) bringing up the morality the the morality oh boy Andrew's going to love that one um okay uh here we got some
(2:36:06) more chats uh chair one don't worry you are part of the 304 Club since you're
(2:36:11) not very smart type 304 into an older calculator and hold hold on Jason Jason
(2:36:16) you've been a little mean here Aya I think is very
(2:36:23) smart Jason I'm not being Jason's defense can I give a a defense of Jason
(2:36:29) I okay fine okay in defense of Jason I have noticed that he's often right about
(2:36:35) almost everything he says so I'm just pointing that out in defense of Jason in defense of Jason
(2:36:41) okay you're very small I don't know I saw I saw her interview with Lex it was really good mhm I thought it was good
(2:36:48) okay all right all right I think I just don't uh I'm not familiar with traditional debate tactics that people
(2:36:53) use when they're trying to win Wars you know like metaphorical Wars um it's pretty hard I think earlier on Andrew
(2:37:00) thought you were trying to do some debate Judo on me and he's like hold on
(2:37:06) as what Andrew what's the title I gave you I I still think that Andrew what's the title I gave you come quat to
(2:37:14) Defensor what was it the yeah that was a it was a it was a bad title right we don't talk about the title Brian Andrew
(2:37:22) is a uh he is the Defensor like King Henry he defended the Catholic faith
(2:37:28) when he was King and the pope gave him a title uh oh my God I can't it's uh fed
(2:37:35) day Defensor I think defender of the faith Andrew is defender of the whatever
(2:37:41) podcast and I gave him a laddin title quad kqu quad ququ defense or that's how
(2:37:47) you say whatever in Latin so he is the defend he's like my uh
(2:37:53) champion who I send into combat to [ __ ] aido my enemies or
(2:38:01) detractors wa shouldn't I I like I like the thought of like not being defensive
(2:38:07) and then like getting hurt if you should be hurt uh oh wait you were making a joke were you joking huh no were you
(2:38:16) wait what's going on I I you can explicitly sayate what's happening and then I would be more comfortable um I
(2:38:22) think I was just trying to say something like uh I like social norms where you
(2:38:28) sort of admit if you're wrong pretty fast and then the conversation and know it's not like
(2:38:33) losing to be wrong and I think a lot of the time like is you're trying to get one over on your opponent such that uh
(2:38:39) if you like score a point it's like very embarrassing if you prove that they're wrong but it's like pretty cool to admit if you're wrong that means you update
(2:38:46) that means that we get closer to finding out what's happening and I think that's like pretty dope I'd rather just Gaslight somebody and just make them
(2:38:51) think I'm kidding I'm kidding thank you for stating that I'm just I don't think Andrew is kidding though look at I
(2:38:58) listen you know it's just in my T that's you know the nodding of the head made the joke
(2:39:04) funnier and then you pointed it out and then that made it less funny so it's like not to me I'm just pointing that
(2:39:10) out yeah I know but women don't have a great sense of humor to be honest with yeah are you trying to and stop with
(2:39:15) this and comments though sense of humor it's
(2:39:21) not it's not Sly um I'm not not making an implication I'm making a declaration
(2:39:26) of fact men are objectively far more hilarious than all women who exist on
(2:39:31) Planet Earth I think probably you're great maybe not all right I'm not going to put in a monolith because otherwise
(2:39:39) you our friend over here is going to get all [ __ ] crazy on me but I'm just saying that uh ultimately I do think
(2:39:46) that men generally are much funnier than I think you're correct I think data generally supports this I also suspect
(2:39:52) they might be more intelligent on average too um but this is unclear about how IQ test about like the greater male
(2:39:58) variability hypothesis even even with that included like I was horrified to find that they normalize IQ test based
() 
(2:40:03) on gender but is really horrified doesn't it indicate that like if you average it the IQ is actually the same
(2:40:10) the IQ is the same they they construct it such that that is the outcome it's not the same uh it's unclear if it is or
(2:40:17) isn't right no but the greater male VAR like so you have like more really really stupid men and then you have more like
(2:40:22) really really really smart men or is that that's not really what the data is saying ultimately you're just saying
(2:40:28) it's not actually clear that that is that that is the case it just is clear that the greatest chess champion who's a
(2:40:34) woman is going to lose to a man that's what's clear it's not actually clear whether or not they're more dumb women
(2:40:41) or or men than there are dumb women when you get to the other level that's that's less clear I mean you can check IQ test
(2:40:47) scores right I mean anyways yeah but IQ but IQ is a variability I mean it has
(2:40:53) significant variance like it's there's a lot of social variance between crystallized IQ non-crystallized IQ like
(2:40:59) it's not that easy to determine even when you're digging into the data it's still to this day unclear you'll hear um
(2:41:06) uh racial supremacists use data a certain way you'll hear liberals use it a certain way you'll hear conservatives
(2:41:12) use it a certain way it's not actually clear H okay I do got to move things on
(2:41:17) but we have Michael Jones here Michael Jones donated $200 SE one is out here trying to resem
(2:41:25) with theism oh in 2025 rock paper scissors is now Gaslight gatekeep girl
(2:41:32) boss hail to King Andrew and vicount Brian thank you VI is VI count or Vis I
(2:41:39) don't know appreciate it man uh thank you Michael Jones really appreciate the TTS guys W's W's in the chat for Michael
(2:41:44) Jones are you do you have autism I think I'm a bit autistic to beon I've I've
(2:41:50) done a survey and people generally think that I do okay yeah have you been diagnosed by a professional
(2:41:56) though you're you're autistic yeah have you been Have You Been hang on hang on chair one have you actually been
(2:42:01) diagnosed no by a okay I didn't think so all show show who who here is autistic
(2:42:08) is it not everyone on the scale though B psychiatrist I me what psychiatrist yeah
(2:42:13) you were diagnosed as okay um but I had to comment on that I think yeah you want to sing a song too or
(2:42:21) I I did a oh sorry
(2:42:27) what I was just saying I did a survey with my community they all thought I was autistic too so I guess but were you
(2:42:33) diagnosed by a psychiatrist it doesn't matter the metric is community says so if the
(2:42:39) community says so then it must be true if they say I mean I didn't say that oh
(2:42:44) yeah I know I know that was that was that was joke oh that's my my head I
(2:42:50) didn't find that funny at all I know I know but again it's because women aren't
(2:42:55) very funny just just pointing it out well I think funniness you know is uh an opinion subjective it is subjective yeah
(2:43:02) I know I know I agree it just say subjectively more men seem to be found to be funny subjectively by more people
(2:43:09) than women I'm just pointing that out poin it out was subjectively unfunny all
(2:43:14) right I got to move on so uh oh going to Lily your notes
(2:43:20) my notes yeah your notes so you uh you did the 101 men in a day
(2:43:26) when's the Thousand scheduled for it well I was Meed it here but I actually got stopped at the border and so I've
() 
(2:43:32) decided against cuz they were very much like you know if you do that here you will be banned and I would like to they
(2:43:39) said that genuinely they when you say the Border like when you flew in or yeah so when I flew into I flew into Las
(2:43:45) Vegas and they stopped me at customs called and they kind of sat me down and
(2:43:51) they started like asking me questions you know what do I do and stuff like that and what's the nature of like why
(2:43:56) you coming into the country business or pleasure and you're like both uh yeah yeah and then um yeah and then they
(2:44:03) started bringing up like my pornhob and they started finding articles cuz my my name is my real name as well so it's
(2:44:09) like quite easy to see on my passport in comparison to and they they're like we know why you're here yeah we won't allow
(2:44:15) it yeah that's what they said yeah basically they said if you do that did you say what if you're one of the
(2:44:20) Thousand you know they were so Stone faced I was trying to make jokes like that and they weren't having any of it yeah wait
(2:44:27) so how willing are you when it comes to deportation I don't want to be deported
(2:44:32) cuz I I actually I would love to like move here and live here okay yeah for work it's great I see so how did you get
(2:44:38) in how did I get in well they let they let me in they said as long as you don't do it and stuff like that and I think they were just more caught up on as well
(2:44:45) making sure I'm not a prostitute um I don't think they care so much about making content more just like
(2:44:52) actual sure you so I guess like what other Hood winks and shenanigans have have you been up to Lily what else I did
(2:44:59) that 50 man that was recent anything else um I'm doing a sky dive where I saw
(2:45:06) a [ __ ] I don't you mentioned that I want to do like the largest
(2:45:11) bukkaki ever cuz I do love SW yeah um the what the largest bu excuse
(2:45:20) me so it's like where you just like a [ __ ] bucket for a day um yeah there I
(2:45:26) mean I've got lots of ideas I don't love to share them cuz I feel like you just never know people might Nick my
(2:45:32) idea shoose the mouth That Got Away um that's cool um yeah I've got a
(2:45:38) lot of ambitious content I I really love to like push the limits of creating content and create content that people
(2:45:44) really haven't seen before what and what does like Dad and Mom think are they cool with it or no my dad and my parents
(2:45:50) are they supportive it's interesting really cuz when I started only fans they were they were very supportive and stuff
(2:45:56) like that and then when I told them I was getting into porn they it wasn't necessarily their first like they
() 
(2:46:03) weren't like yes go on suck that [ __ ] you know they weren't cheering me on telling me to do porn it wasn't their
(2:46:09) first pick of jobs for me um and then when I started doing kind of like the more extreme stuff yeah they
(2:46:17) they're this is how I describe it they're not not supportive of their job but they're supportive of me and they always love me and have my back in you
(2:46:24) know okay yeah sure so that I hope that makes
(2:46:30) sense nice did you have to get used to liking spunk like was it acquired taste
(2:46:35) or did you I've always liked it okay yeah especially when I did my first buuk Kaki that was when I was like well
(2:46:41) what's what's spunk uh come
(2:46:46) Jazz oh I mean there but there's a limit here right so well there's a limit of SP you can take well this is what I'm also
(2:46:52) trying no no no no hang on hang on hang on let me ask the question just one second okay there has to be a a limit to
(2:46:59) the amount of crazier and crazy so this I mean this happens in every industry right so but especially in entertainment
(2:47:05) you're trying to push the number for attention right and this is how you can stand out so only fans be no different
(2:47:11) uh any industry would be this way if you push the limit with the extremes more attention is going to get focused on you
(2:47:17) so sure for for marketing purposes this is great this type of thing but there's only going to be so much of that right
(2:47:23) because other people they get involved in this type of stuff too they start moving the goal for what the limit is
(2:47:29) and there is definitely a limit like there is physically only so many men you can sleep with in a day only so many men
(2:47:35) who can hump you up the butt or whatever the [ __ ] it is that the next next thing is that you're wanting to do you're
(2:47:41) going to hit that threshold right and it'll be sooner rather than later because there's only so much content you
(2:47:46) can push out so what do you do post that exactly exctly well when I mentioned that like I want to do extreme stuff it
(2:47:52) didn't always mean numbers like with the Skydive that's not a numbers thing and
(2:47:57) things like that so there isn't really a limit now no I think I think there is like um you could do scuba di blue jobs
(2:48:04) right but I'm sure there there's definitely not a limit now I've got I've got a very imaginative literally
(2:48:10) has there I mean there there actually has to be a liit so it's just m i mean I'm not going to give you all my ideas
(2:48:15) but I could list off some stuff that you know you haven't seen before like she doesn't want her competitors to steal [ __ ] like you got to understand yeah but
(2:48:22) but I'm just trying to steal my ideas let's say you had 100 great ideas for Content nobody's ever seen before that kind of thing you will hit a limit
(2:48:29) threshold when I'm 55 and ready to retire yeah but when you make more and
(2:48:35) more extreme content you hit the threshold sooner rather than later like let me give you some examples of this in in other forms of media so somebody
(2:48:42) comes out recently Kanye West he came out and he was like he did the you know like I love Hitler thing right that
(2:48:48) drives a ton of attention to Kanye West there's no doubt about it but the problem is that he'd already done that
(2:48:54) brought less attention this time where does he go from iHeart Hitler where does
(2:49:00) he go next do you know what I mean what's the next extremity you can actually go to from that that's the same
(2:49:07) problem that you'll find in the same industry right I feel like you're getting me wrong as well like I'm not
(2:49:13) necessarily doing it you know for attention I want to create this unique content for my subscribers I like to do
(2:49:19) really like relative content as well like well then you would do it for free but you don't well I do do it for free I
(2:49:25) do gang bangs in my personal life and things like that I've always had a lot of sex but I just put two and two
(2:49:31) together something I love and something I can also monetize and mix them together and it has Honestly made the
(2:49:37) perfect job for me right so um we had a a gal on here once who said the exact
(2:49:42) same thing uh ended up becoming at least by her her metric a reformed Christian
(2:49:47) and said that everything that she was saying earlier on the podcast was a complete lie right and that she was
(2:49:53) actually just doing that for well that's one of the purpose of marketing hang on hang on I'll let you respond I promise
(2:50:00) uh but the thing is is like it does draw a large amount of media attention to you
(2:50:05) there's no ifans or butts about that and you can say well I would just do the do it anyway because I just really really
(2:50:10) really like it okay I can just kind of grant that but even if it is the case that you just really really like it and
(2:50:15) you're going to do it in your personal life anyway you're going to go bang a thousand men cuz just love that [ __ ] it wouldn't have anything to do with the
(2:50:21) fact that there's a threshold limit put on the extremes right but I just de that earlier there's a ton of other ideas
(2:50:28) that I have that aren't necessarily with high numbers yeah no I I I see the lag I I
(2:50:35) get it but that would still make my point like there's still going to be a threshold isn't this test like you could
(2:50:40) write down all those I'm just wondering if there's a post threshold if you have like plans post threshold for that I don't think you realize like how h you
(2:50:49) know the sex industry is and how many different routes you can take with content like there's there's tons of
(2:50:55) things you can always do I'm not I'm not disputing that the sex industry is huge
(2:51:00) and that there's tons of different types of content you can do I'm not disputing that but when you're talking about the
(2:51:05) draw so most women and only fans don't make it almost the vast vast vast majority the vast majority of women in
(2:51:11) getting corn don't make it the vast vast majority well it's because they don't have anything to makes them stand out
(2:51:17) right you have something here that makes you stand out but that that has limits too and so the question that I'm asking
(2:51:24) is is like I can just base this on the general average almost nobody makes it in your industry like almost nobody so
(2:51:31) almost nobody don't think so well if that would be corn only fans things like that almost no woman makes it in those
(2:51:36) Industries makes it what you oh is in like makes it big sorry I thought you meant like well makes it big or even makes enough money to support themselves
(2:51:43) most of them don't even make enough money to support themselves the a average only fans a couple hundred bucks yeah no I don't doubt
(2:51:49) yeah they're hardly making anything so it is definitely the multimedia attention this type of thing which assists in the elevation of the amount
(2:51:55) of people who watch somebody's content so you do have to think about what threshold Breakers are like what happens
(2:52:01) when I reach whatever this Zenith is that could come very quickly and so I'm just wondering if there's post plans to
(2:52:07) it I I don't understand what question you're asking like have I got enough content to last me my lifetime and like
(2:52:12) have I gotten off ideas I'm I'm confused I'm saying that assuming that
(2:52:18) there's less media attention for your Skydive [ __ ] than there was for a thousand man gang bang but for me it's
(2:52:23) not always about media possible that there could be a massive decrease in fact it's likely as you get older and as
(2:52:30) you do more extreme content there's going to be a massive decrease I'm just asking if there's post plans past what
(2:52:36) happens when that happens that's all I'm asking yeah I definitely have post plans I mean I want to be in this industry for
(2:52:42) as long as I enjoy it and for me right now that's looking at 10 20 years honestly um but for me it's also just
(2:52:49) not all about the medor attention like I just genuinely Do It For the Love of
(2:52:54) it so you would do a Skydive blow job for free yeah I think that would be hilarious like I can't wait to do it I'm
(2:53:01) super gassed to do it now then all the all the money that you make from that are you going to give it to
(2:53:06) charity what what has that got to do with it what has me being Char are you
(2:53:12) going to give it to charity you're going to keep it I I I couldn't care less if I gave money to charity like the money for
(2:53:17) me can you give me some the money for me is a plus don't get me
(2:53:22) wrong I'm not trying to hear saying you know but everyone does stuff for money like that's why we [ __ ] have jobs I'm
(2:53:27) not disputing that either I'm just saying that I if you say that the motivation is there and it has nothing
(2:53:33) to do with the money I would do it any no I'm not saying final final thought there's just like it's different aspects
(2:53:39) I love it it's also pays me like those are just two great recipes together why
(2:53:45) would I not want to do it yeah right exactly so then if if there's monetary gain here right and I assume that there
(2:53:51) is and there is this is directly proportional to the amount of publicity that you get for the various things that
(2:53:57) you do however women often especially in your industry hit walls with that very
(2:54:02) quickly just like beist actors will have a breakout movie and then it just goes right down it's very hard to keep
(2:54:07) yourself on top for anong elongated period of time that's why I'm asking the question well I'll keep you updated in
(2:54:13) 10 years all right we have to leave it there uh moving on uh so you said you did the bow and then your boyfriend
(2:54:20) reacted oh yeah that because I saw an episode on your
(2:54:26) podcast oops sorry um it was because I saw an episode on your podcast where a
(2:54:32) wife did that for her husband my um boyfriend did not really react he I just
(2:54:38) greeted him at the door when he came home from work and did the bow and I was like you know I have dinner ready and we

(2:54:45) just continued our conversation normally he didn't really react he didn't like it
(2:54:51) um it's not that he didn't like it also since we have Andrew here Korean women do not bow to we're going
(2:54:59) to let's not that's just B they they let's not get into it yeah they do I
(2:55:04) literally lived in Korea and my mom's Korean and my grandma's Korean they do not yeah well I mean whether you live
(2:55:09) there or not um they definitely do bow in Korea they bow in Korea that is very
(2:55:15) true but not to their husbands well they don't now because of the the 4B movement but that used to be very
(2:55:22) common place no they the door tell I'll tell ask your mom if it used to be very
(2:55:28) common place for a wife to bow to her husband I already asked back back 30 or 40 even 40 years ago common I asked it's
(2:55:37) not a thing yeah it is a thing they bow to their bosses maybe to their acquaintances that they don't know very
(2:55:42) well to show respect but your husband is someone that or to their boss or comfortable or for ritualistic purposes
(2:55:50) or sometimes to the husband especially considering how many Christians are in South Korea that's why they have a full
(2:55:56) porn band in South Korea right it is actually common place even among that Community to bow to each other just so
(2:56:02) you know they do Bow to each other but not to their husbands to their husband yes to their husband maybe at a formal
(2:56:09) event like a wedding but not every day at the door well this is I mean
(2:56:15) obviously I can't say every woman in South Korea bows or husband but I would never make that claim anyway I'm just saying that it is common place or at
(2:56:22) least it used to be common place enough still common place in Japan still common place in a lot of Asian Nations
(2:56:28) including South Korea and North Korea even no in Korea they do Bow but not to their
(2:56:33) spouse okay yeah thank you I mean I I I I don't know how I
(2:56:41) could falsify I mean I can give you demonstrations that this is the case I mean you can in fact you literally
(2:56:47) Google it write this second if you wanted to and it would come up and and tell you that yes the Bowing is a is a
(2:56:53) form of respect between husband and wife even in South Korea and still is even to this day with more traditional families
(2:57:00) where are you getting your answer from uh I mean you again you can look at the
(2:57:05) various cultural studies which have been done including in South Korean Culture by by own
(2:57:10) cult they do B to each other Koreans do B to each other but not to their family
(2:57:16) which is their husband yeah sometimes to their family like why wouldn't they so let me ask you this why wouldn't they
(2:57:21) bow to their family what is the cult my older brother I do not bow to my
(2:57:27) parents I might bow to my grandparents I'm not asking if you bow to your parents or you bow to your older brother though there could be circumstances
(2:57:33) where that was the case in South Korea too especially for your parents I'm saying that yes there are traditional
(2:57:38) Koreans whose why the wife bows to the husband that is factually the case I don't know what else to tell you no fact
(2:57:46) the case that's not factually the cas Cas okay so and I know that
(2:57:51) because because my grandma was born in 1951 in South Korea and I lived glad
(2:57:59) through my entire childhood yeah and my brother married a South Korean brought her home when he was stationed in South
(2:58:05) Korea and uh yeah there was definitely bowing which was going on so I mean my an I guess I guess my anecdote Trump's
(2:58:13) your anecdote right no there is bowing to the other family but not to the
(2:58:18) husband and if it is to the husband because she hasn't seen him in a long
(2:58:23) time so they do Bow to their husband if they haven't seen them in a long time if they haven't seen them in a long time
(2:58:29) but not on the daily oh I see so they do B to their husbands got you thank you not on the daily like you Proclaim yeah
(2:58:35) I didn't say that they did on the daily you just made that up well you said on special events and in weddings they do B
(2:58:40) I said it's common that in Asian cultures including South Korea that wives will bow to husbands that is
(2:58:46) common you just asserted it's not common because they see their husband every day it's not it's not
(2:58:53) common but okay you tell yourself that okay do husband do wives bow to husbands
(2:58:58) who they haven't seen in a while um usually with the cas now you're
(2:59:03) not sure but um they can okay got it so because there's probably lots and lots
(2:59:10) and lots of couples who haven't seen each other in a long timeing how many people in South they usually live close
(2:59:16) to their work especially how many people people live closer to their work and then they go to their they go to
(2:59:23) their if it is thee to GRE them after they come home from work
(2:59:29) common after they come home from work what does common mean does that
(2:59:35) just mean every everybody has to do it is that common no it means the majority of people and the majority of Korean
(2:59:40) wives do not bow to their husbands when they come home from work every day I mean you guys are just going back and forth who cares just ask you a question
(2:59:49) right uh do the majority of people buy expensive
(2:59:55) dresses no no okay but isn't it common that people buy expensive
(3:00:01) dresses no no it's not common it's not it's not something that happens so much
(3:00:07) on the regular that you never dispute it happening because it's common place
(3:00:12) right um a lot of people will not pay more than $50 for a dress tot agree but
(3:00:19) it's still common that people will buy expensive dresses guys guys guys guys guys stop both of you just stop both of you stop
(3:00:26) we have so much to get through I'm sorry I don't care about the the bow oh he
(3:00:32) doesn't care about the bow no because you put it in your notes and honestly I I excluded it like everybody submits
(3:00:39) different things I don't find it particularly an interesting conversation to have if you guys are debating about the the uh bowing meta in South Kore I
(3:00:48) don't I do not care honestly if ID wanted to discuss it I would have included it in the notes I don't you
(3:00:55) think one thing Andrew thinks another thing like what you guys are just going in circles what else well I you're not
(3:01:02) going to change your mind she he's not going to change his mind like I I what else do you guys want to talk about no I'll change my mind if it was
(3:01:09) demonstrated to me that uh South Koreans do not actually in fact ever B to their husbands I would retract my statement
(3:01:16) but in fact she she she asserted that it is in fact true that they do it's just circumstantial in the way that they do
(3:01:23) circumstantial yes what percent of women do never it's never been my claim that
(3:01:28) South Korean women the second if their husband hits the door they get on their knees and bow to him I don't know where he ever came up with
(3:01:34) that that's what you said in a prior podcast no it's not what I said in a prior podcast it says very commment in
(3:01:42) Asian Nations for women to vow including to their husband which is true including South Korea which is also true which you
(3:01:48) just demonstrated not every day I didn't say every day if you could show me them saying that me ever saying the word
(3:01:54) every day uh then you would have a g but uh it's never happened they don't greet
(3:02:00) I'm always careful with my language for a reason bow every day they don't okay yeah but nobody ever claimed
(3:02:06) they did so I don't know what you're argu I don't I don't know what you're arguing against so it's not a claim I made
(3:02:13) that's for sure okay
(3:02:21) okay all right um so you brought up the bow thing your boyfriend had no reaction
(3:02:27) to it okay you said best advice about relationships you want to elaborate on the show please be uh concise if you can
(3:02:34) yeah my best relationship for advice is uh the Law of Attraction if you create
(3:02:40) the best version of yourself if you educate yourself strengthen yourself every single day then you will attract a
(3:02:47) very good person person for you in your life so it's not chasing you have to better yourself before you can be
() 
(3:02:54) anyone's partner so Law of Attraction mhm that's
(3:02:59) the relationship advice yep what does that mean what does that look like Law of Attraction so going to the gym you
(3:03:06) see things in yourself that you want to fix you shouldn't go out trying to um
(3:03:12) get a date instead you should be improving the flaws that you want to fix so like going to the gym or going to
(3:03:19) your classes every day um making that bank at your job or whatever it
(3:03:26) is so you're saying you shouldn't actively be trying to chase somebody yeah you should just sit back and wait
(3:03:33) for them to come yep because I mean this is kind of a very convenient position for women to take although men cannot I
(3:03:39) have to categor categorically just reject your position as it pertains to men's uh mating strategy men cannot just
(3:03:47) sit around and wait for a woman to magically manifest out of The Ether men have to actually take initiative when it
(3:03:54) comes to dating so I just reject position around they are improving themselves doesn't matter men still have
(3:04:00) to take initiative men have to make the first move even if they're like they do I agree with you that men should they
(3:04:05) can make the first move but I'm saying not to make that your whole life like looking for a partner don't make that
(3:04:11) your whole life make your life you make it about improving yourself uh yeah I I agree with you that
(3:04:18) men should improve themselves but this idea that uh just kind of like go about your life as a man live your life as
(3:04:24) best as you can and women will magically Manifest this is just this is a position women can take you just have to exist
(3:04:31) and by virtue of existing you will have men in your DMs you will have men who come and approach you women almost uh
(3:04:39) women never make almost never make the first move women don't approach women don't typically slide into DMS so I just
(3:04:47) I don't understand how your advice perhaps this is to some degree good advice for women I'm not even sure if
(3:04:52) that's the case but I cannot advise this uh well I I think it is good advice for
(3:04:57) women um I can understand where you're coming from in the position that it's harder for men to find a partner if um
(3:05:06) they're the only ones really making the first move um I'm just saying that if
(3:05:13) you're really desperate for a partner and you make that your entire life
(3:05:18) um it will be harder for you to spend time improving yourself so you have to
(3:05:24) uh focus on improving yourself rather than pursuing
(3:05:30) women so what should men do then prove themselves okay but I mean I
(3:05:37) don't think like even like so you're just saying oh all these men they're only focusing on women
(3:05:43) like they're they're just like spending all day like cold approaching women in the street
(3:05:49) they're like neglecting large time consumption I would say in people's schedules like the one day I decided to
(3:05:56) download dating app I was on there I think I looked at my screen time for 3 hours that's as much time as I spent on like Instagram and I didn't even realize
(3:06:03) it because it's so fastpaced into the mic please go ahead it's so fast paced
(3:06:08) mhm so sure it just is very timec consuming I just don't think it's good
(3:06:13) prescriptive advice to tell men to just manifest a woman like oh she'll just um
(3:06:21) well depends on what we're talking about but um yeah a guy can't just like sit around
(3:06:28) even if he like levels up gets his money up gets in the gym I'm not saying sit around you can make the first move but
(3:06:35) just don't you know pursue it like don't don't pursue it don't pursue it to the point where I mean for the third time
(3:06:41) can you speak into your mic please don't pursue it to the point where you feel like um it's taking up three three hours
(3:06:48) of your day you could be spending that at the gym at school at work um you see
(3:06:53) a pretty girl at at the gym and you go up to her and say hey what's up don't let that take over the time that you're
(3:06:59) going to be working out yeah I mean I don't disagree I don't think all your time should be dedicated towards chasing
(3:07:04) women exactly but like if we're talking about the law of attraction like my understand like the secret this seems to
(3:07:09) be some sort of uh prescriptive advice that things will come to you if you like have a vision board or some [ __ ]
(3:07:16) like oh okay I'm just just going to like manifest these things into the universe they'll come to me in fact they they'll
(3:07:23) even say I I saw the the secret they're like oh you just if you get bills in the mail and you just start thinking like
(3:07:30) how abundant your life is the bills will stop coming or you manifest a parking
(3:07:35) spot simply by thinking about I'm going to find a parking spot it's like what no
(3:07:42) like as a guy you have to actually take like actual steps when it comes to dating to like get a woman you can't
(3:07:48) just like sit there I'm in the club I'll just sit here let all the women come up to me and offer them me sex never
(3:07:55) happens except for Andrew happens to him all the time right Andrew when he was when he used to go to
(3:08:03) the club when he was a Chad still is a Chad sorry still Chad still Chad okay I
(3:08:08) don't know whatever anyways um you said comment on Natural Body Supremacy you like to elaborate you watch the video uh
(3:08:16) everyone will reverse what they did you want to clarify yeah so I saw this um Tick Tock about how um there's going to
(3:08:24) be a new Beauty Trend and it's going to be about reversing all of the plastic surgery that people have done so like um
(3:08:30) dissolving their Botox um getting the fat removed out of their BBL Etc um and
(3:08:37) that's just because beauty standards are forever unreachable and uh now that people have
() 
(3:08:43) kind of permanently altered their body they're going to or semi-permanently um
(3:08:49) they're going to make them reverse it so now it the natural body is going to be trending the natural body is going to be
(3:08:57) trending and [Music] yeah what do you mean
(3:09:02) trending as in beauty standards they're constantly changing okay yep sure yeah any any fake
(3:09:11) titties at the panel yourself included no no I got
(3:09:16) those naturally uh got to lose a bit of weight you know um okay yeah um so
(3:09:23) you're just commenting on how natural bodies are like coming more back into favor yes because said f that you're a
(3:09:31) natural body supremacist right yeah I am so I thought that was somewhat relevant
(3:09:36) okay sure yeah uh you dis disagreement with something you said last time apparently contradictory that you're an
(3:09:42) egalitarian for other women but a complementarian in your own personal life yeah I addressed that before Oh
(3:09:49) okay um and then you wanted to react to like a bear video or not the bear video but um you sent me a clip you want to
(3:09:55) react to that you wanted to like have the panel react to that um yeah because you always ask the question if you were
(3:10:01) stuck in a forest would it rather be would you rather it be a bear or a man and so um that came up on my for you
(3:10:08) where a woman was actually battered for not acknowledging a man across the
(3:10:14) street who was cat calling her so that's why in the caption she she said this is why women choose the bear okay sure
(3:10:20) that's totally fine um we'll go into that really quick we'll pull up the video in the moment but first let's go around the table uh so you're in the
(3:10:29) woods would you rather come across a random man or random bear starting with
(3:10:35) you um I think I have to think for a second yeah I'm not saying her position
() 
(3:10:41) was mine I'm just I don't know now yeah how did you not know I was going to ask
(3:10:47) this qu okay I thought you were going to start there well sometimes we go this way um this is like kneejerk gut
(3:10:54) reaction man or a bear probably a bear okay what about you
(3:11:00) a man okay a man okay probably bear bear
(3:11:05) all right a man man is this adraa have a man yeah not for
(3:11:11) sex for you can't have no bear gang bangs Okay they're H hung by the way
(3:11:19) just be careful um what I'm not going to be saling oh okay is that more somebody else's okay never mind uh be man which
(3:11:26) do you pick man oh did you yeah which did you pick um I picked i' Rob have the guy the
(3:11:33) man okay how yeah Candice man Aya what do you pick man definitely man okay so
(3:11:39) we got only two bears here so bear and then you picked the bear um
(3:11:44) just really quick why do you pick bear why don't you pick man I think the last time I was on I asked if um I asked if
(3:11:51) um we could have bear spray on us and you said yes so yeah I would chose the
(3:11:57) bear what's B spray it's uh it's like pepper spray except yeah you can also
(3:12:02) use the bear also works on a man that works on a man pretty effectively um but
(3:12:07) uh what What's your fear there what's the fear of the man because you you pick a wild animal over the man so why do you
(3:12:13) pick uh bear I feel like in any case of trouble they're just as um agile as I am
(3:12:18) you know bearss are kind of limited to their bears are faster than humans and they can climb trees yeah but they're a
(3:12:24) little bit more clumsy and big so they can't quite get into the Bears are not
(3:12:29) clumsy yes they're quite they're quite clumsy maybe climb mountains climb
(3:12:34) mountains with ease they literally climb up sheer Rock faces with ease and same
(3:12:40) thing with trees they climb up trees very easily they're not they're not actually very clumsy at all
(3:12:46) yeah yeah because they have their claws but I mean like in general their movements like their arms waving in the
(3:12:51) air sure um but what what's the fear of the man what's the fear of man what
(3:12:57) their arms waving in the is this like what bare arm AR kind
(3:13:02) of anime are you watching yeah I don't know yeah I mean they do have to like attack you do the bass run at you they
(3:13:10) don't need to stand up do they run oh really um why don't you pick man though
(3:13:16) for forget about the bear why why don't you pick man H um I would be scared they try to
(3:13:22) violate me in some way that's okay that's the concern what about you oh I mean I kind of just said it like off the
(3:13:28) top of my head like in my head it was like if a bear is trying to attack me versus if a man is trying to attack me
(3:13:35) like I feel like with the bear it would just be over faster oh no they eat you alive and slowly and they started the
(3:13:42) groin Candace is I did not know that yeah Candace is right they they
(3:13:48) it will be the worst death imaginable well then you know I change my answer like some animals will kill you first
(3:13:53) then eat you but Bears will just start eating I don't know a lot about bears so that's what I thought but if not then
(3:13:59) but the was the concern for you similar to her like oh well like a bear could kill me a man could kill me but the man could like torture me he could essay me
(3:14:06) this sort of thing I mean I guess that's like a small part of it for me it was more so like you know in my head once
(3:14:12) again that like bear would kill me faster so no okay which apparently is not true but but that's more so you know
(3:14:21) what though I don't think we can actually pull up the clip because it's kind of graphic and she's
(3:14:27) got like facial injuries um so I yeah it's it would fall on her door probably
(3:14:32) that yeah I mean it's not it's not that like terrible like she's got like pretty bad uh like black eyes but what's your
(3:14:41) how do you categorize like this this incident or whatever um so the the PRP
(3:14:47) over that she's in like the hospital she is pretty bruised up I I'll just have to describe it there's a uh text that reads
(3:14:55) this is why women pick the bear I was quite literally walking down the street and me not acknowledging a man got me
(3:15:02) this um and then she did some other posts I didn't really investigate it that much but
(3:15:09) um I mean she was attacked violently um obviously that's a terrible thing um I'm
(3:15:17) a little confused though like she's claiming it's happened because she didn't acknowledge the man obviously we're not there we don't know um I do
() 
(3:15:25) think sometimes women like will like a homeless man will like say some like outlandish [ __ ] like a homeless mentally
(3:15:30) challenged per not mentally challenged like mentally ill homeless person who's like on drugs will like say something to
(3:15:37) a woman and then women will like map that on to all men not saying that there like there's not normal quote unquote
(3:15:44) normal men who are like Despicable I'm not saying that but like women will encounter like homeless people homeless
(3:15:50) men or like mentally ill men and then be like oh okay like let me map this on to
(3:15:56) like all men and I just think some guy like randomly beating up a woman in the
(3:16:01) street like unprovoked I have to wonder like was he was he on drugs was he
(3:16:07) like homeless or something I don't know we don't know the full story okay oh okay but I do have a
(3:16:15) question for you um when it comes to this whole like this is so this it reads this is why women pick the
(3:16:22) bear um if we replace
(3:16:28) um uh women with white people this is why white people pick the
(3:16:34) bear and the implication here would be over a black person I was quite literally walking
(3:16:40) down the street and me not acknowledging a black person got me this would this be a racist
(3:16:45) statement if they're generalizing white people to uh choose a black person over
(3:16:52) being on the street with a bear no but like so she's saying this is
(3:16:58) why women pick the bear over men so like let's say let's say you're victimized by
(3:17:04) a black person and then you make a an Instagram story and you say oh okay well
(3:17:10) this is why white people pick the bear over black people because
(3:17:17) I was victimized by this demographic is it
(3:17:24) racist yeah okay so then the position when it comes to men is sexist just to
(3:17:30) be logically consistent
(3:17:38) um yeah I would say okay so women just women who pick bear are they
(3:17:43) sexist um they're not sexist it might come from a point of view of personal experience I think when you make those
(3:17:50) General statements like this is why women choose the bear over the man um
(3:17:57) those statements are pretty sexist but from an individual that statement might be coming from personal experience so
(3:18:04) you're saying on the individual level it's if someone prefers the bear over the man but would they individually on
(3:18:11) the micro level be sexist uh they might be sexist they might be sexist yeah oh okay I mean if
(3:18:19) you're granting my position that it's sexist I really have anything to debate with you on um do you think sexism is
(3:18:26) good or bad uh I don't think sexism in any case is good okay so
(3:18:32) like why do we sort of paint men with this sort of broad brush like why do we just view them as Predators or um to the
(3:18:41) point where like vast amounts of women are saying I'd rather be in the force alone
(3:18:47) with like a dangerous wild animal over a man like imagine if people like white people just started saying I'd rather be
(3:18:52) in the force alone with a dangerous wild animal than a black person that that would like have to be racist so I'm
(3:18:59) wondering like why is it so okay in I guess modern discourse to just be like
(3:19:05) openly sexist towards men that's what I find kind of confusing I'm not sure why but um a lot
(3:19:11) of women have had bad personal experiences with I I don't disagree but
(3:19:17) I would just go back to like doing a parallel to race okay let's say a white
(3:19:22) person has had one two or three bad experiences with a black person they see news stories and belong to online groups
(3:19:29) and their Tik Tock Tik Tok algorithm is feeding them stories about black onwhite crime and they have safety concerns uh
(3:19:36) and then they're like all of a sudden they're scared of black people they believe they uh believe all black people
(3:19:42) have the capacity for violence or assault of some kind would this has to be a racist position to hold AO it also
(3:19:49) must be a sexist position to hold if as a woman you've had individual negative experiences with men and then you think
(3:19:55) all men are like Predators or dangerous or whatever those women who've had those
(3:20:00) negative experiences they might not think that all men are predators or dangerous they might just be a little
(3:20:06) bit more cautious based on their experience yeah sure and that's okay for
(3:20:11) people to be more cautious based on their experience it doesn't mean that they think that all men are dangerous or
(3:20:17) Predators it's just that they have a wall up or a guard up okay
(3:20:23) sure um anyways we kind of talk we always talk about the bear so we won't linger too long on that I'll get back to
(3:20:29) the show notes Here uh let's go to Becca Becca a ex Pastor you walked away from
(3:20:35) Ministry religion un and unsupportive beliefs in order to find fall in love
(3:20:40) with and live as your true self true self okay uh you said you excuse me help
(3:20:47) women drop the good girl Persona and you create a full turn turn turn on of their
(3:20:53) voice visibility and impact you also occasionally get a little naked on the only
(3:20:59) fans um you said something about [ __ ] based confidence what is [ __ ] based
(3:21:05) confidence um [ __ ] based confidence is kind of a term that I coin but what it

(3:21:11) really has to do with is um our sexuality is like the creative life force of us so so when I talk about
(3:21:17) [ __ ] based confidence it's really the energy of a full turn on like that statement says a full turn on not just sexually speaking but a turn on of our
(3:21:23) life force a turn on of ourselves in every way a turn on of actually like appreciating who we are validating who
(3:21:31) we are and living in a way that's aligned to our soul [ __ ] based conf is there what is
(3:21:37) the um what is the soul in this context uh for me the soul is like
(3:21:44) people use different versions of this word I would say it's like your deeper intuition your deeper knowing I believe personally that our soul existed before
(3:21:50) this is just a body so this is where my spirituality gets into it a little bit is it's not an agenda I push but I would
(3:21:56) say like you know you have like a gut knowing like this is like something's off or this is the right decision that's
(3:22:01) what I'm referencing do do you think then that people who don't have good intuition don't have souls or they have bad souls
(3:22:08) or no not at all everyone has great intuition people are just disconnected from it and as women we are taught from
(3:22:15) a young age many of us not all of us to be disconnected from our bodies we're
(3:22:20) taught that our body is bad like I grew up in a home where it's like your body it wasn't called bad it was very much
(3:22:26) like you need to cover it you need to keep it protected it's for your husband only like masturbation is wrong the
(3:22:33) [ __ ] no I'm talking about like the the body and the disconnection from it cuz I was referencing how your intuition is
(3:22:39) within your body you feel it in your body yeah so this um well just real quick before Brian continues the line of
(3:22:45) inquiry I just want to sure I understand a couple things so when you say spiritualism I'm not sure does that are
(3:22:52) you saying there's a Creator it's not the Christian God but it's some other God or what what does that mean exactly
(3:22:57) spiritualism ises that infer some religious archetype or no witchcraft or
(3:23:03) something like that like what is it what what are we what are we alluding to for spiritualism here um well I didn't say
(3:23:08) spiritualism I just said I'm spiritual but when I'm talking about spirituality for me spiritualism right sure sure I'm
(3:23:15) just go ahead I'm just referencing for me um some form of a higher power for me it
(3:23:21) feels more like energy that's how I would reference it yeah I think for everybody it's different right for me I
(3:23:26) had for years I had the lens of Christianity on what I mean by that is I had Supernatural experiences for many
(3:23:33) years and I look back and out it's like oh because I'm not a Christian anymore they weren't real no they were real they were very real they were real through
(3:23:39) the lens of my Christian world view and you take that lens ghost like ghosts and stuff like that uh I I never call them
(3:23:47) ghosts but yeah I mean I had yeah I feel like we're getting a ghost well I mean we're not I'm just
(3:23:53) clarifying right I just want to understand exactly what it is that you're saying when you use these terms
(3:23:59) right so for me I think you understand what I mean when I say Christianity anyway uh but if you ever want to
(3:24:04) clarify I could clarify it for you but when you say spiritual right it is important for me to understand what you
(3:24:09) mean by that so if you're if you're saying well there's some kind of grand archetype I'm not sure what it is or some type of deity perhaps I'm not sure
(3:24:15) what it is the supernatural does exist I'm just not sure what it is that all forms into that worldview that you have
(3:24:21) and so that's that's what I'm interested in is kind of seeing what that is you know what I mean so I can understand
(3:24:26) sure that's not something that I push yeah that's not something that I push as any type of agenda for me it goes back
(3:24:32) to like the intuition so as a coach one of my main goals if I have any really is to bring the person back home to
(3:24:37) themselves so I'm not going to tell them what to do I think that people can come back to a deeper knowing it's just that you have to come you have to actually
(3:24:43) start getting the layers of programming and conditioning off you first we're all
(3:24:49) brought up in some type of programming isn't what you're doing programming and conditioning in what way well you're
(3:24:55) programming people that they need to come back to a deeper sense of self and that there's a a deep sense of intuition
() 
(3:25:02) which spiritual yeah you can call it that I mean it's programming too right sure except there are no Staples of
(3:25:08) beliefs that I'm telling them to go to I'm bringing them back to themselves yeah well St there's no staple of belief
(3:25:15) what are you bringing them back to their own intuition their own knowing I that's one of I'm sorry would that
(3:25:23) require belief it does require belief yeah so then so then it sounds like it's
(3:25:28) Dogma sure whatever makes you feel good about calling it that I have a quick question is it are
(3:25:35) you just teaching people to love themselves or like you're asking like with the coaching yeah is it so I work I
(3:25:42) actually no I do a lot of confidence coaching for entrepreneurs so it's actually like this is not even the a lot
(3:25:48) of what I I do with coaching that's why I feel like we're kind of you describe yourself no go you go ahead no I was
(3:25:56) trying to understand what exactly it was that you do like if you're just teaching cuz what what did you call it [ __ ]
(3:26:03) something [ __ ] [ __ ] B [ __ ] based confidence are you like teaching people to go out there and use their [ __ ] to
(3:26:10) like love themselves in a sense I wouldn't I wouldn't word it that way no I'm getting them back in touch with they
(3:26:16) are and part of that is their sexual creative power but really we're doing a lot of work with mindset sematic
(3:26:22) elements because your nervous system if it's not on board you're not going to change your mind so there's a lot of there's a lot of but like are you is it
(3:26:29) per one partner or you're saying people oh no this isn't like about this is this has no agenda like separate with like
(3:26:36) people having sex with people or anything like that no you describe yourself as a baddie a baddie yeah I
(3:26:41) think I saw somewhere you describe yourself as a absolutely definitely I don't know I I have some thoughts on this cuz I've seen other women like
(3:26:47) self-describe like baddy boss babe bad [ __ ] whatever it is um I feel like like
(3:26:53) women who self-refer to themselves in it's kind of like guys who call themselves alpha male oh I don't think
(3:26:59) of it as an alpha energy well how about we ask me what definition would be clear
(3:27:05) I'm not saying that you're referring to yourself as an alpha yeah but it's like The Men Who refer to themselves as alpha
(3:27:12) or alpha male it's kind of lame that's fine yeah
(3:27:17) so like what's that quote from Game of Thrones Tywin Lannister Joffrey like
(3:27:23) yeah anyone that has to tell someone that they're a king is no King no King something like that I don't know it's just yeah it was more it was more out of
(3:27:30) fun and playfulness because I have a lot of fun and playfulness to myself that I can understand how that comes across are you saying you perceive her as insecure
(3:27:36) H are you saying you perceive her as insecure I don't think that would be enough like data to make like a total
(3:27:44) like a determination into ality but I do think like women who tend to like self-refer like Oh I'm a baddie like if
(3:27:52) you're a baddy you don't need to say you're a baddy and I it's not so much like uh it's more so I I draw parallel
(3:27:59) to like the guys who call themselves alpha males like it's just kind of like like do you guys think that's like attractive if or
(3:28:06) like if a guy calls himself an alpha male like it's just kind of you know it
(3:28:12) doesn't really right you don't you don't feel the type of way about that I do yeah I don't I it I wonder if there's
(3:28:17) are they actually Alpha usually never usually never I don't
(3:28:22) know oh did you have more Aya or just bit of a I I feel like like there's like
(3:28:29) I think it's like fine if you view her as insecure and for what I don't know if you are or not yeah that's oh I mean I
(3:28:34) wasn't even making a a claim like that okay I just was Wonder I wasn't sure if like when you responding to me you were
(3:28:40) like kind of feeling like maybe like you're not supposed to like say that directly or something so I just want to say that I I wasn't feeling I was trying
(3:28:46) to trap you or anything I was just generally curious if that was how you felt M but it's that's fine it's not a
(3:28:52) big deal yeah I don't I can't make a uh determination on that specific thing
(3:28:57) just on the basis that she referred to herself as a baddie but I mean I was
(3:29:03) just making the parallel to like the whole thing where guys call themselves alpha or alpha male um you have a
(3:29:08) daughter right I have two daughters and a son two daughters and a son um and how how old is she 19 18 and 133 okay and
(3:29:16) like would you want her to do uh o if she felt it was a line for her but I don't push it okay all right and um all
(3:29:26) right uh getting into your some crazy dating stories you said there was a time you were swinger for a bit but lots of
(3:29:32) stories there in general uh what will be fun to talk about with me is that you're a pastor we talked about that um and
(3:29:38) then like you said you're a top one o Creator like so what does that actually mean like top 1% um top top one
(3:29:46) percentages have to do with income typically but isn't I I don't know exactly how it works on only fans but
(3:29:52) isn't it the case like when you're factoring in top 1% like aren't you factoring in the accounts that are like the consumers so they don't post
(3:29:59) anything but they're just like buying the only fans content no idea haven't you done stuff on this yeah or is it
(3:30:04) just Creator based when you're look people are talking about percentages yeah I you would know better than me yeah I I I'm under the impression that
(3:30:11) it does not take into account people who are creators but it does take into account inactive Creator accounts M so
(3:30:17) it it's a yeah I think like most active accounts are typically in the top like 3 to
(3:30:23) 8% okay sure uh and then let's see here you uh okay you wanted to talk about
(3:30:30) vetting dates communication sex plus respect and dismantling what is appropriate especially for women when it
(3:30:35) comes to what they do with their bodies um and then overall belief that what your dis what you desire exists this is
(3:30:42) a big one um what do you mean by uh when it comes to what they dismantling what is appropriate when it comes to what
(3:30:48) they do with their body as women I think it's just the narrative that is that exists and has existed for so long that
() 
(3:30:55) women who are um expressing themselves sexually in whatever way that looks like
(3:31:00) maybe it's just they dress super sexy whatever that they can't be that and also respected that they can't be that
(3:31:06) and also a person of influence that they can't be that and also a leader and so and that's not to say everyone feels
(3:31:12) that way but I think that is definitely a narrative in our society okay all right so I mean would you take
(3:31:19) quarrel then like let's say a a man a man's standard is uh he'd prefer to date
(3:31:26) a woman who dressed modestly do you you take objection or Coral no I think that's preference and there's nothing wrong with that okay um H all right but
(3:31:34) aren't these narratives aren't these narratives built around preference like isn't that the very idea
(3:31:40) behind the narrative that you're talking about so if the the you're saying a woman's dressing promiscuously let's say
(3:31:45) she all tatted up she's dressed promiscuously this type of thing um and you say but that doesn't actually
(3:31:51) detract from the fact that she could be a powerful leader or you could be this you could be that but isn't the the
(3:31:57) reason the narrative exists in the first place because the preference of exg
(3:32:02) group doesn't like that to begin with so isn't that in a way kind of setting people up for failure I guess but you're
(3:32:09) also talking about a standard of social norms versus just a preference right those are those to me are two different
(3:32:14) things right social norms come from preferences right sure a whole lot of
(3:32:21) people having a certain preference based on certain beliefs that can be really daming toward one gender or One race or
(3:32:27) whatever yeah I mean whether they are they're not right they're still coming from preferences so if it is the case
(3:32:33) that these are coming from preferences if you tell women that like let's say most men have a preference against women
(3:32:40) who dress promiscuously and have tons of tattoos and things like this right at least like let's say I don't know
(3:32:47) high-powered Executives or people like this who want a long-term relationship right the chances are they don't want
(3:32:53) their woman to show up with sleeve tattoos and dress promiscuously when they're around you know XX group isn't
(3:32:59) it kind of setting them up for failure to tell them that it's actually no you can reclaim this in some power position
(3:33:05) which ultimately isn't even up to them it's up to other people's preference right in certain ways but I'm it's not
(3:33:11) so black and white as you're declaring it to be right you're making I'm not saying it's black I'm just asking yeah I
(3:33:17) think in certain in certain ways yes if you're talking about like a top CEO executive position they're going in for
(3:33:22) they can't just dress however they want but it's it's more about embracing their sexuality in general and expressing it
(3:33:29) in whatever way feels good to them and the idea that and again this is like the whole taboo energy that we have in the
(3:33:36) society the idea that like oh well the respect goes out the window right like people aren't going to respect you and
(3:33:41) that's that's very true for the most part I I agree I just think that aren't you isn't it counterintuitive so if
(3:33:48) you're saying well this is socially taboo which means the taboo came from preference I mean otherwise it wouldn't
(3:33:55) be a taboo like it what would make it a taboo other than tons and tons of people prefer that it's not you know happening
(3:34:02) right that that's what a taboo would be so that's the case if if you're telling women to embrace this thing which is
(3:34:10) taboo then you're also essentially telling them that they're going to be at the mercy of all of these preferences is
(3:34:16) against that taboo doesn't that how does that not set them up for failure yeah it just depends on how they're choosing to
(3:34:21) because like for me right I'm on only fans okay that's not not every woman not even close to every woman or even a
(3:34:26) large percentage of it is going to want to express themselves that way so I have the privilege of running my own business
(3:34:33) so I'm not going to have anybody coming down my throat and telling me I can't dress a certain way or do certain things but it doesn't mean that a woman who's
(3:34:40) in corporate can't decide she's going to express herself in the way that she wants in a way that feels good to her
(3:34:46) because I have women come to me they're like oh I want to do only fans and because they know I do it they're asking me for my advice they're like I can't do
(3:34:52) it in the way that you do it can I do it anonymously whatever and this is just an only fans example but it's it's just
(3:34:58) figuring out what feels good to them and feels align that they can push the edges on and yes at the same time this is more
(3:35:05) of a movement of dismantling the things that are telling us as women we have to look a certain way we have to cover you
(3:35:11) know ourselves in a certain way to be respected or to be respectable and it has to you know fit in this box of other
(3:35:17) people's expectations that's literally the number one regret of the dying so this is much broader is that people
(3:35:23) aren't regretting what they didn't accomplish and they didn't freaking make a bunch of money they're regretting that they lived a life for everyone else's
(3:35:29) expectations instead of being true to themselves most people aren't on their deathbed wishing they got gang bang so
(3:35:34) the thing is is like ultimately ultimately if if the idea here is preference based right and you're like
(3:35:41) it's a movement against these social tabos which is what you're after right why wouldn't that in instead create
(3:35:47) Whiplash where the movement against those social taboos becomes even stronger it's like in some ways right I
(3:35:54) I get what you're trying to do you're saying going against the grain feminists have been doing this for you know decades and decades and decades but the
(3:36:00) Whiplash against it now is like nothing I've ever seen you know gen Z is becoming more conservative uh and less
(3:36:06) liberal and they they want more conservative women not less liberal more women are saying they want more conservative men less liberal men things
(3:36:13) like this it seems like the movement towards tradition is backlash against exactly what you're trying to attempt
(3:36:18) which is basically what feminists have been trying to attempt sexual Liberation for about 70 years well and I agree and
(3:36:26) also it's not a movement for everyone I'm not out here saying every [ __ ] woman needs to be following this every
(3:36:31) woman should be coming on but it is for the women who are in a place where they feel that angst they feel this
(3:36:37) fragmentation of their body of of their life because they're living this way and feeling this way right and so I'm not
(3:36:43) for everyone as a coach I'm not for everyone as a speaker and the movement isn't for every woman but it is for the women who want to Take Back Control in
(3:36:50) that way and actually be more self-expressed in a way that feels good that lights them up that they felt like they couldn't do before yeah but I guess
(3:36:57) what I'm asking is like is it really control so when you think about it so I'm just trying to think about it from
(3:37:02) your perspective right the idea of we're giving control back to these women who feel like they're maybe sexually
(3:37:07) oppressed or that they can't express themselves properly sexually without being judged by it right sure but is
(3:37:13) that really control like is that that really control or is it setting you up for failure well I don't consider it
(3:37:20) control like for instance what are you controlling at that point for me it's personal sovereignty it's personal
(3:37:25) autonomy it's personal agency right so it's not about like control and having control over even other people's
(3:37:30) opinions per se I mean the things that I've done stepping down from church from Ministry walking away from church
(3:37:36) deconstructing my faith and being like I'm no longer a Christian after that's what everyone knew me for that was that
(3:37:42) was not easy I had to get to a point where I actually was so grounded in who I was and who and loving myself and
(3:37:47) knowing judgment is coming from every angle I had no one for a whole year no
(3:37:52) one in my judg comes a lot less when you convince people over to your side right that but that's the beauty of it that's
(3:37:58) what I'm trying to say is I don't have any agenda to to like prove any my side to anyone and I don't I think that's the
(3:38:05) whole that's where we all go wrong you can prove a point or you can influence a heart but you cannot do both so it has
(3:38:13) to come back no I'm pretty pretty confident you can not only win a point but influence a heart at the same time
(3:38:19) I'm 100% confident it's very uncommon when proving the point comes from an agenda of I'm right and you're wrong
(3:38:26) that's all that's what I mean by that statement well you may not win over that person's heart right but this is why we
(3:38:31) have social tabos to begin with people have been having these debates for thousands of years right not this isn't the first one first time people in two
(3:38:37) different worldviews have ever clashed and uh not agreed with each other right but what are they clashing for well
(3:38:43) they're usually clashing not to convince the opposite person but to convince the people who are viewing The Clash right
(3:38:49) yeah this is the same reason people show up to sporting events and everything else right they showing up for The Clash
(3:38:54) itself they want to see which thing wins out which thing it makes the most sense
(3:39:00) it seems to me that if it is the case that there's a massive social taboo against the idea of this sexual
(3:39:06) Liberation that you would actually instead of empowering women be setting them up for failure by telling them that
(3:39:12) they should do everything in their power to go against what what the preferences of most men are like that seems so
(3:39:18) counterintuitive to me yeah I'm not that that's not the goal the goal isn't go against everything men have preference
(3:39:25) for the goal is figure out who you are and what's aligned for you and where you're hiding parts of you and where
(3:39:30) you're shaming parts of you that's what I mean well then what is [ __ ] Power what is [ __ ] Power except saying that
(3:39:36) you have power in your sexuality and its expression but the preference of most men is that when women Express overt
(3:39:43) sexuality right they don't like it they're like wait that makes you easy or that makes you this or that makes you
(3:39:48) that uh they definitely don't have a preference for easy women not most men there's some men I'll grant you that do
(3:39:55) but most men don't so that that's like it just seems like it's setting people up for failure by that MRI in a way yeah
(3:40:03) there and that's a whole side topic because [ __ ] based confidence is not
(3:40:08) just about the idea of just getting them back to their sexuality and having it sexually expressed well I mean if I said
(3:40:13) I teach a course on Dick based confidence right wouldn't you I mean what what would your assumption there be
(3:40:19) your assumption there would be uh men are in charge men are liberated uh men
(3:40:25) do what they want and we're going to you know we're going to go bang a bunch of chicks you know like those would be the
(3:40:30) pre-assumptions which are built into that and those would be reasonable assumptions wouldn't they yes I'm sorry
(3:40:37) I got distracted by the comment and also there seems to be a protest outside so I
(3:40:42) have to tell you that I did not hear the last sentence you said I think they're calling stop
(3:40:48) oh yeah there's like a
(3:41:14) lot e
(3:42:02) I don't know um so okay uh what where were we what were we talking about um we
(3:42:08) were just finishing I think unless you have more you wanted to head on I
(3:42:14) honestly can't say cuz I didn't hear the last sentence you said so sorry yeah I mean I'll get into some of the uh other
(3:42:19) show notes so uh let me uh do that so okay uh let's see here wait wait wait
(3:42:25) what are they calling for there no oh my
(3:42:42) God okay um hold on moving on uh wait hold
(3:43:08) on all right uh okay let's get back into some of the pre-show notes then we're just going to have to move it on uh
(3:43:14) let's see here we we do have uh uh anything else here from Becca um let's
(3:43:21) see asked you to no okay we're just going to move it on to Katarina uh Katarina your pre-show notes
(3:43:28) here you said pick me to be on your stupid show that was the beginning of
(3:43:35) it I thought that was all the notes W you got picked yeah that like that was
(3:43:43) last year and banter back before with everybody
(3:43:49) and they all told me it was a bad idea so I decided not to but then my sister
() 
(3:43:55) came to La so I thought hey I'll swing by oh okay cool um why is the show
(3:44:01) stupid well I just think that you guys um don't give us like I think
(3:44:12) that I don't think your show is stupid I said that oh okay yeah I know I said
(3:44:18) that like when there was some I think you guys do a great job of um you know
(3:44:23) getting your likes and getting your comments and getting going viral um and I thought that coming on would be
(3:44:33) fun and something fun to do with my sister cuz we don't really get to hang out much and um I always wanted to come
(3:44:39) to LA and that's why I end up here um apologize to call calling your show
(3:44:45) stupid it is a little bit like you know
(3:44:51) um sorry I've never been like on a mic before so just give me a minute to I've
(3:44:57) just been sitting here trying to figure out what the right words to say are I think that um you know people that use and
(3:45:06) take advantage of people for money in all sense are um not like I live my life
(3:45:13) not using and taking advantage of people for money and um it's really hard to do that and I
(3:45:18) think that like I'm not trying to say anything bad about sex work my mom uh was in sex work so I have a big heart
(3:45:26) for it um I just think that there's more to each
(3:45:33) individual story and I don't think you guys really give much tenderness to like
(3:45:38) the women that are on here okay well is there anything else or cuz I I want to
(3:45:44) go Point by point what else is there anything else or is that it it's about it okay so you you mentioned using and
(3:45:51) taking advantage of people for money and I don't say money saying I'm not saying
(3:45:56) that you guys do that I'm just saying why did you bring it up then I just I I brought it up because um
(3:46:04) I okay I asked you for how the show is stupid and then you invoked you you said
(3:46:09) using and taking advantage of people how how are we using and taking advantage of people that you guys are using I bring
(3:46:15) it up when I as you the basis of your claim that the show stupid I meant like
(3:46:20) I just wanted to come on the show and prove a different side of you know being a woman and not using and taking
(3:46:27) advantage of people for money um and being like you know trying to be Noble in this world um without um you know
(3:46:36) putting other people down at the same point of um like uh growing up with all like porn
(3:46:46) and and how it desensitizes people and I think that um you know there's I don't
(3:46:52) I've never like I've never actually watched porn in my life so like um I don't see the I don't see the hype I
(3:46:59) think that um it's really hard to be a good
(3:47:04) person in this world and it takes a lot of work and effort and um I just want to
(3:47:10) do the right thing and I don't mean to put anybody down I was like you know probably my feelings about something
(3:47:16) that you said when I wrote that message and um okay so your position is not that
(3:47:22) we're using and taking advantage of people you're saying you don't use and take advantage people yeah because it's
(3:47:28) so easy to use and take advantage of people I've been used and take advantage of for many things okay so I think that
(3:47:34) like the whole message that I'm trying to convey being on this show is like not to do that and just
(3:47:42) to you know okay so just to be charitable here you're saying that it's
(3:47:47) our position that we make the claim that for example women who do only fans they're using and taking advantage of
(3:47:53) men and you don't use and take advantage of men is that your position basically yeah I
(3:48:00) mean I honestly don't I I honestly don't even really like the porn bad
(3:48:05) conversation I find it kind of boring but um I'm not saying porn is bad I'm just saying I don't want it I didn't say
(3:48:10) you said that um but uh I mean there and actually I do want to give a little bit
(3:48:17) of credit to uh Candice here because I I saw on your I looked at some of your links on your only fans it appears that
(3:48:24) you uh and I wrote this down I've never seen this uh on an only fans profile but
(3:48:30) you wrote something along the lines of uh you write the engagement on this
(3:48:36) platform by uh Eva is it Eva or EV Eva laa is strictly for entertainment
() 
(3:48:41) purposes only all interactions represent a cur digital Persona and should not be interpreted as personal professional or
(3:48:48) real world relationships uh Eva does oper character and all interaction trademark by the way and all
(3:48:54) interactions are intended to remain within the boundaries of this digital platform is that like a disclaimer
(3:48:59) because you're are you using AI or you have like chat like the chatter no no I don't use AI at all um but you have like
(3:49:05) Chatters or like management that like chats for you no I have management that helps with content but no I try to get to as many people as I can which is but
(3:49:12) you don't have like a typer or a chatter no no no no oh because I thought this was the disclosure you were essentially no the disclosure no the disclosure is
(3:49:19) to make it clear because sometimes there can be um delusional men and it's not
(3:49:26) always their fault cuz I have seen really bad practices let me get this m out sorry I have seen um bad practices
(3:49:32) from creators as well where they I mean I've heard them literally say I'm going to suck the this guy dry right like I'm
(3:49:39) just going to like drain his bank account like I think that that's awful I no one should be doing that so um okay I
(3:49:45) want it to be abundantly clear like this is entertainment if we are engaging in chat like that it's not a relationship
(3:49:51) consume this responsibly so you don't have anybody sending messages on your behalf
(3:49:57) NOP okay I mean I wasn't I perhaps misunderstood this portion of it I
(3:50:04) thought this was actually like a disclosure like hey by the way like you might not actually be talking to me um
(3:50:11) because that kind of goes into my point here of how like I think I think there is some degree of
(3:50:17) fraud uh that's going on sweet though that you put like a little disc but I
(3:50:23) actually I mean um Candace I actually now that I've brought it here though this actually was not my intention so I
(3:50:29) don't want to you to feel like you're being blindsided or whatever but like um uh I was under the impression that
(3:50:36) this disclaimer was indicating that you did use like typers and Chatters or you had like AI or for example I mean I see
(3:50:42) that you're active now but you're sitting here at the table no it's active because it's just like whether or not you have an app but if you go to chat
(3:50:48) like there's not going to isn't it based on like how recently you sent a message no no you can have it open I
(3:50:55) accidentally I've had it open on like a laptop and it was open for days and that was mortifying yeah all right I'll I'll
(3:51:01) take your word for it um but it is the case that a lot of these women who are on only fans are uh employing like a
(3:51:07) typer a chatter and having somebody uh communicate like through proxy or on
(3:51:13) their behalf um and I think my trouble with this is if you're upfront with this I suppose
(3:51:19) that's fine but if you're making representations in many women will actually write you're talking to me
(3:51:25) you're not talking to a manager you're not talk like you're talking to me I'm sending the message I mean this would be
(3:51:30) a form of fraud um that I think uh I mean I don't know if it's criminal fraud but no it's
(3:51:37) definitely not criminal but you're you're also could be well we'll we'll see you'd have to find a laot but um
(3:51:43) they're engaging the Persona as well you know what I mean so I wait are you defending the use of like typers where
(3:51:50) you've otherwise say where you like represented that you haven't no no no I'm saying um like if you're going there
(3:51:56) because you're trying to establish like a real relationship you're in the wrong place so that's kind of that disclaimer because that can get physically
(3:52:02) dangerous too um stalkers yeah exactly and that happens really often so I think
(3:52:07) it's important to know like this is this is all Pretend We're engaging and pretend together yeah no I just bring it
(3:52:13) up because that's one of my uh I mean the nude photos and stuff like people have like moral objections to like
(3:52:19) pornography nude photos I mean that's not really a super strong position I tend to argue my biggest position when
(3:52:26) it comes to like only fans is these women are just straight up misrepresenting and like engaging and fraudulent conduct yeah I don't agree
(3:52:32) with that either and I've seen a lot of people that will pretend to fall in love or just send me this right and that's a
(3:52:37) really D dangerous game to play and that's not fair to the guy either yeah yeah how how do you feel about fake
(3:52:42) orgasms fake orgasms I I don't think people should do it in relationships I think uh
(3:52:48) you should communicate openly with your partner if there's things that they can improve on so you can climax but I meant
() 
(3:52:54) like I guess in porn or only fans oh in porn and only fans yeah like if somebody like fakes an orgasm isn't that just the industry like
(3:53:01) the women just fake their organisms I sure okay sure yeah I guess I don't know maybe there's a spectrum maybe you could
(3:53:06) design a spectrum of like the kinds of things where fraud is bad or not um I also don't mean this as a gotcha I'm
(3:53:12) just like genuinely well I mean but like what about actresses in films where there's a sex scene they gu like implied knowledge like implied like if
(3:53:18) somebody's siging up for expect I If a woman fakes an orgasm in like a pornographic film I don't think I mean
(3:53:26) you know like the pizza guy knocks on the door I mean that's also not he's not
(3:53:31) actually a pizza guy and she's not actually in her her house and it's I
(3:53:36) mean it's it's Cinema MH right so I I don't really have objections if a woman
(3:53:41) fakes an orgasm for porn it like in porn I was thinking of it from the lens of
(3:53:47) like a relationship but that's not what you're talking about but uh but what I'm speaking about is like let's say a woman
(3:53:53) makes an affirmative claim like I you're talking to me and like in so doing she's
(3:54:00) like inducing these men oh I'm actually talking to her not some like Filipino man in the Philippines being paid $10 a
(3:54:08) day to like type type type type you know whatever um and so if like she's charging people for the the
(3:54:14) conversations or whatever charging for the chats um and you're like if if a company
(3:54:20) says hey you can talk to ex celebrity and somebody pays knowing that
(3:54:27) they're like actually oh I'm actually talking to I don't know if this is actually service like uh I don't know
(3:54:33) what if like you guys know Cameo that app where like celebrity that's on video so they obviously can't fake that but
(3:54:39) let's say there's like a voice thing or whatever and like they you can buy a voice recording from your favorite
(3:54:45) celebrity but then you find out that they hired a like a impersonator who does like a really good impersonation of
(3:54:51) the celebrity I think that would be like that that would meet the definition of civil fraud yeah and I I I mean you
(3:54:59) might think oh well buyer beware like you should know better blah blah blah but I do think like if you're making a representation whether you're in um you
(3:55:07) have a a company and you're selling like nutritional products to people or your sex worker I think like you should try
(3:55:13) to make uh you should try to make like truthful statements that are not like misrepresenting and are not fraudulent
(3:55:19) as in an effort to induce somebody to like purchasing your product yeah I I definitely strongly sympathize with this
(3:55:26) I generally like think lying is pretty bad um it's unclear to me the degree to which men know that what they're doing
(3:55:33) when they're signing up for only fans um like as an example like I run my main only fans and then for a while I decided
(3:55:38) to hire to try experiment with hiring a chatter on my free only fans um and the chatter was terrible they weren't like
(3:55:44) me at all they they typed like all caps XOXO BB my P you know whatever is so
(3:55:50) horny for you it was like really atrocious had nothing to do with me and my income just skyrocketed based off of
(3:55:57) that I was like oh these guys like have actually no understanding of who I am as a person and like no desire to actually
(3:56:02) engage with me as a person and that sort of like made me pretty sad about the whole thing cuz I kind of thought that
(3:56:08) men cared more than they do but it's possible that maybe I'm just actually filtering for the wrong kind of man when I'm doing that so I don't know
(3:56:15) yeah anyways um getting back to your notes Katarina you said that I'm sorry it's Katrina I've told you Katrina
(3:56:22) Katrina you oh okay sorry sorry yeah uh
(3:56:27) you said long story short you have two moms yeah um you've you said you ran
() 
(3:56:33) girls in drugs yeah random what do you mean ran girls
(3:56:40) you were a pimp for a little while I was helping out a friend and did her makeup
(3:56:45) got her calls and you know like it was really hard to watch I wanted to help her and she um and she
(3:56:53) just could lied said that she could do it without do you know being using all
(3:56:58) the time and um and she couldn't and so it kind of was a backfire on me um when
(3:57:05) I say that like sorry I wasn't expecting you to read my stuff out loud but like I the
(3:57:14) pre-show notes that's all good um but yeah you asked me like some other questions afterwards that I thought
(3:57:20) would be more but like that was kind of personal things I just wanted to like let you know a little bit of who I was
(3:57:26) um I didn't expect to be put on blast for that but that's okay it's okay you wrote it I'm not putting you on blast
(3:57:32) I'm just when you say you I know I thought you were going to use the questions that you asked me oh I have those too but you included this I
(3:57:39) included that when I just like letting you letting you know personally like why like who I was um and why I thought that
(3:57:47) I would have yeah and you know I wouldn't say it was a PMP or anything
(3:57:52) like that I just what does running girl ran girls what does that mean like got
(3:57:58) them like took their like got them calls and uh took them to their spot did their
(3:58:03) makeup you know made them were the the women that you were running just one girl so I well you said girls plural you
(3:58:10) said I know I said there was there was only one girl yeah okay you said girls but um but I just like saw was she a
(3:58:17) prostitute yes okay and when you say you ran a prostitute you were the p i she I
(3:58:24) just did her favors and she paid me for it you know but you would would you stay
(3:58:29) there while she was meeting with client and did the did the client ever not
(3:58:36) pay no okay what what would happen if a c didn't pay would you like go in and I
(3:58:43) mean conversation with them I mean like I'm not I'm saying that
(3:58:49) like I had an experience where I was involved with trying to help a girl get
(3:58:55) out of a bad situation and she said she would partner with me to get you know
(3:59:00) onto a better place and it didn't work out and it she trying to get out of a bad situation by prostituting herself
(3:59:07) well I mean like I'm pretty like uh what do you call it I'm
(3:59:12) pretty AUST to the game so like I see what do you mean accustomed to the game like I grew up like you
(3:59:19) know were you yourself a prostitute no never so how what do you mean when you
(3:59:24) accustomed to the game just like and what is the game I'm very white so I don't know what the game is the game is
(3:59:30) just like the um the the under just the like the underworld of
(3:59:36) like all of well you did say drugs too right right when you say running drugs what does that what does that mean like
(3:59:42) dealing drug like selling not like that like knowing the dudes that do and being involved with them and stuff like that
(3:59:48) like and I've like you know seen just the bad side of that type of World um
(3:59:57) and like having pity for um these women that are and like how women that are you
(4:00:04) know think that that's the only way and I know some girls who can do it like
(4:00:09) sober and like they're vivacious and they can do that but like most of the girls that I know are all messed up on
(4:00:15) drugs and it's uh and they do it for survival and um it's it's not like it's
(4:00:24) not like in Amsterdam or other countries like it's uh regulated you know like
(4:00:29) here it's just like so what drugs were you running what do you mean marijuana was it drugs
(4:00:38) marijuana I'm just you wrote it I'm just asking about your own disclosure here um
(4:00:45) okay you said you're okay I'm not going to go into that a little little uh dark
(4:00:50) but uh okay you said you don't do o you never got paid for
(4:00:56) sex um 100% no cosmetic surgery you uh
(4:01:01) you say you don't hate everything that we say but some things are really hot yeah it's hot topics for sure anything
(4:01:08) like in particular or um probably just like
(4:01:14) the way that you try to make
() 
(4:01:20) like sorry I just don't think you guys have the tenderness uh when it comes to what women go through and how they got
(4:01:26) to where they are most of the time that's true I mean I actually have to kind of concede this point to you I am
(4:01:33) not in fact tender enough to drive women to meet with Johns who are then going to [ __ ] them I'm going to lead that kind of
(4:01:40) sort of tenderness up to women like you like I said um I was just trying to help
(4:01:47) and I learned a lesson yeah I mean I just I guess I just would never be tender enough to be that
(4:01:53) helpful I think that my um
(4:01:59) disclosures um had good intentions and my intentions are pure whether you want
(4:02:04) to believe so or not yeah well then I could just say that too right my intentions are pure what makes them
(4:02:10) impure other than you don't think they are but I can tell you this I have never dri driven a woman to try to get her out
(4:02:17) of trouble to go have a penis put inside of her for money I've never done hang on I've never done that but I feel I feel
(4:02:24) like that's the least tender thing I could ever do with a woman what I do instead is I uh I'll argue their
(4:02:31) worldview and I'll argue their belief and I'll treat them as though they should be heard and their belief should
(4:02:36) be contended with now that seems to be horrible in modernity because men for some reason uh well not not men but
(4:02:44) women for some reason think that if they're in any way ever questioned and that their view is not completely
(4:02:49) conceited to and their asses kissed that you're an evildoer of Nefarious character for some reason but I got to
(4:02:55) tell you I think that the most respectful thing I could do is take what they're actually saying seriously and
(4:03:01) then contend with what they're actually saying now if I end up destroying their arguments because they're [ __ ] stupid
(4:03:07) uh that's on them but that has nothing to do with us treating women poorly or
(4:03:12) without tenderness it's us treating them like people I think that it's the most untendered thing I've ever heard to be
(4:03:18) like hey oh really uh you know you're in a bad situation H Let's uh let's show up at a guy whose appointment I booked for
(4:03:25) you he'll [ __ ] you and give you some money that doesn't sound very [ __ ] tender to me I got to tell you that's
(4:03:31) fair um like I said um it was an experience that taught me a lot and I
(4:03:38) Grew From it and I've like wish that you know there could be some other kinds of
(4:03:44) ways to be able to protect these girls and I'm not going to say it's me cuz I'm just a woman right um but like at least
(4:03:51) like in Canada um it doesn't have anything to do with you being a woman but
(4:03:56) acting yeah acting in the social role of the pimp probably isn't the best way to protect women as in fact I would argue
(4:04:04) it's perhaps one of the worst ways possible to protect women for all the program which that's the whole reason
(4:04:09) why they pay them in Pay pimps in the first place though right is because for protection cuz like of what can happen
(4:04:17) yeah but what kind of parasite would allow that like how you be so parasitical that you would actually
(4:04:23) allow strangers to [ __ ] a woman while you took a percentage of it and then say it's on her behalf I mean yeah go to me
(4:04:32) pimp is so parasitical a literal parasite on society almost as bad as a
(4:04:38) prostitute herself and so I was like well from my view what you're talking about is is unadulterated evil from my
(4:04:47) view I think that I think you don't really understand what's really going on in the world here because we're just
(4:04:53) like there's nothing if there's like a market then like who's paying it's the
(4:04:59) men that are paying you think it's it's really funny to me when when we talk about supply and
(4:05:06) demand right we could we could make a market out of anything couldn't we we could make a market out of uh murder we
(4:05:12) could make a market out of theft we could I mean there could be all sorts of demand for theft right and all sorts of
(4:05:18) suppliers then for theft but that wouldn't make it right it would make it just would make it moral right so the
(4:05:24) thing is is like you could have thieving gangs and there's a an endless amount of
(4:05:30) people who want to engage in this activity right and tons of supply for the uh people who want the stolen goods
(4:05:37) things like this it doesn't mean that it's right or it's righteous or it's in any way good so the thing is is like
(4:05:43) when I hear this when I hear this idea of well you know there's a supply and a demand issue yeah that's true but what
(4:05:50) do you think is easier to control the few thousand suppliers or the millions of consumers I would say it's far easier
(4:05:57) to control the suppliers than it is the the consumers
(4:06:03) right sure like what I what I don't think that
(4:06:09) you're understanding from what I'm saying is that like we're all just trying to survive out here and when you
() 
(4:06:15) learn lessons along the way um you can either choose to like continue with the bad or you can you know try to be more
(4:06:22) righteous um I don't think that what I did was right I just was in the moment I
(4:06:29) thought that I was doing the right thing yeah I understand final thought Andrew
(4:06:34) you have an intention to do what is good but that doesn't mean it is though I'm
(4:06:39) and I'm not even beating you up about these decisions what I'm saying is that make a later justification that I did
(4:06:46) these bad things based on hardship right because because things were hard it's
(4:06:51) like you know you should read Essie hinton's Outsiders is a great line in it it was written by a woman in fact uh
(4:06:57) when she was 16 things are rough all over py boy right and what she's saying in this uh novel is it doesn't matter if
(4:07:04) you're the Southside so it doesn't matter if you're a greaser things are rough all over you don't get to make immoral actions because things are
(4:07:11) really hard everybody has hardship so that that's that's all I'm saying all right we need to uh get
(4:07:17) through a couple chats this one came in a while ago Alex I do want to apologize for the delay here for getting this

(4:11:52) yeah yeah for him I'm going to DM you back on cash app or whatever you said that to um we'll get him on but wait
(4:11:59) Ryan then that would destroy the narrative that you only have a women on the show no I think it would be really interesting though because like I think
(4:12:05) some of the narrative when it comes to like women who are involved in like sex work is it like it's going to have like
(4:12:10) really negative impacts on your relationships like here you are granted you met him before you started but like
(4:12:16) here you are you've been married you have kids um from the sound of it I mean
(4:12:21) you guys have been together a really long time maybe there's like a little bit of issues early on but like you guys
(4:12:27) are together um handsome guy by the way yeah oh God
(4:12:32) yeah sorry that now G um not helping your case no he seems like a good guy he
(4:12:39) seems like a good guy I think it'd be an interesting conversation to have if you want to run it by him um that could be cool um because like I
(4:12:46) said we here you are I guess defying I don't know if you would consider defying
(4:12:51) the odds but a lot of I think it's the case that maybe maybe not a lot but a lot of women in the industry sometimes
(4:12:57) struggle when it comes to dating especially like maybe while while they're in it but even afterwards they
(4:13:03) they can struggle a little bit but I don't I I think that's a fair point M um so that could be an interesting conversation also Andrew wants to have a
(4:13:10) 1 V one with Aya and uh Candice
(4:13:15) Well for what not a shoot not a shoot he wants to have like a
() 
(4:13:21) debate if you're down I do not like his debate Norms because I don't trust him to be truth finding seems more like
(4:13:28) [ __ ] uh but I'm down for truth finding oh really yeah okay just give be a descriptor for what truth is then is
(4:13:34) truth subjective or objective that's a great example yeah that great example of what
(4:13:41) of your debate norms yeah of us clarifying debate Norms yeah
(4:13:47) I I think I'm mostly interested in finding out what's going on uh instead of like trying to do public battle I
(4:13:55) think you relate to debate as public battle um which makes sense to do sometimes depends I don't think I really
(4:14:00) have that if you're looking for just pure fact finding or fact versus fact I'm happy to do those twoo you can do
(4:14:05) what's called a formal or time debate where you can match facts against facts they just think your facts are wrong and
(4:14:10) I can demonstrate that via debate if you prefer a less adversarial form of debate we would do a formal which would be you
(4:14:18) could put your facts up and then I could debunk them all I would like to know if I'm wrong I
(4:14:24) would hope that You' like to know if you're wrong and then maybe we can like help each other figure out I'm never wrong I'm a man what's wrong with you
(4:14:30) never wrong never wrong sorry sir wrong I'm wrong all the time but in this case
(4:14:36) you're you're empirical data is really not good and I I would enjoy actually doing a debate on the empirical data
(4:14:42) that you put out as though it's uh it's actually good data it's not good data well we can have further conversations
(4:14:49) and see if that can be arranged but uh couple things did you ever hear back from Special Forces I'm working on it I
(4:14:55) got a couple responses I had a oh my goodness how many people are slandering me godam a lot do go on the internet do
(4:15:02) your due diligence um any responses though special forces guy any so now
(4:15:09) yeah now it's going around in circles so do you mean going around in circles like I'm I'm not getting a solid answer so
(4:15:16) what do you mean not a solid answer not a solid answer so can you tell me the name of the person that made this claim
(4:15:23) right and then he yeah and then he said a name and I was like well is that the person that showed up or you got the information like is this now like 3°
(4:15:30) away sister instead of like what you said which was one degree away and then
(4:15:36) that's what sudden when we do our due diligence look at what happens with due
(4:15:41) diligence the whole makes no sense Andrew don't punish behavior that you want repeated I'm
(4:15:47) openly trying to see if I'm wrong and willing and willing to admit that and concede and apologize so I don't need to
() 
(4:15:55) be like it rubbed in I we've been we've been high on the concession but short on the apology cuz I'm trying to get
(4:16:01) answers you're the one that's like that's harping on due diligence I'm trying to get details how much more
(4:16:06) verification do you need then Brian says not only hang on hang on Brian says not
(4:16:11) only is this factually untr but on top of it being factually untrue you actually don't have a leg to stand on to even make the claim it's secondhand
(4:16:17) information you say I'll verify the claim and then you go well they kind of giving me the run around it's like it
(4:16:23) just seems like it's a concession without the portion that matters which
(4:16:28) is the accountability of Poli I was asking clarifying questions cuz he said a name and I don't I'm not going to
(4:16:34) throw the wrong name under the bus so that's what I was saying is they he I got one name and I said did this person
(4:16:39) is he the one making the claim that he got rejected or are you saying you got the story from him cuz I'm not going to
(4:16:45) say oh Bob is the one that came here and you're like it's the guy who killed Osama right is it that guy right yeah
(4:16:50) exactly no I'll on the I don't want to throw the wrong person ladies would you date the guy who killed Osama Bin Laden
(4:16:56) no it wasn't him it wasn't him no no it was it was not him Li sorry
(4:17:02) that was a get your mind out of the gutter damn Lily tell you what I tell you what how about maybe we can make a
(4:17:09) bargain so we can just move past this right that'd be great if you if you are to apologize to Brian right hang on
(4:17:16) apologize to him for the obvious slander which was here without you doing your due diligence but it turns out you are
(4:17:22) actually right okay you're actually correct then I will apologize to you and
(4:17:27) you won't even have to ask I'll just I'll literally just put out a public apology how's that for fair I want to add Andrew has never apologized to a
(4:17:35) woman ever in the history of that's how absolutely sure I am you will get his
(4:17:42) first you will take his apology to a woman virginity yeah it's not something
(4:17:47) that I want it's not something that I want you want trust me you could put this [ __ ] on your
(4:17:54) resume so even then even then with this you still apologize actually wait should should we get the
(4:18:01) do you want to do the bow are you going to do the bow or I'll do the can we play the bow video really quick I feel like it's important at this point yeah but
(4:18:08) the apologies actually I feel like uh like 10 tenfold uh more painful right because um she
(4:18:16) just clearly does not want to apologize that's not all doesn't want to no that's not at all you're absolutely putting
(4:18:23) words in my mouth I again I didn't want to throw the wrong name under and say oh that was the person that came Brian huh
(4:18:29) I I so sorry that I didn't do my due diligence and I just took the gossip
() 
(4:18:35) train and then made a video that got a lot of views and misrepresented they got
(4:18:40) a lot of views they got a lot of views what the that misrepresented you and your show and I should have contacted
(4:18:47) you before making such a claim because that is my responsibility how manys forg
(4:18:54) you upload and I'm so sorry Andrew that my Indian editor put your name in there

(4:22:12) thanks yeah think that's neat okay so uh we have Aman Yaman old chick in the red
(4:22:18) dress is the unfortunate example of damn bro you guys are mean come on man uh example of protestantism's tendency
(4:22:25) towards generating delusional weirdos do you want to respond oh it doesn't deserve a response I mean there's a
(4:22:31) couple different women in red it was it was me I'm 43 I'm the old
(4:22:37) chick okay yeah do you want no I don't care oh okay all right well uh aan thank
(4:22:44) you for the Super Chat do appreciate it uh guys if you want you can get a read in at 100 TTS 200 and then you can also
(4:22:50) drop uh a not they they don't take a cut Veno cash app whatever pod uh let's just
(4:22:56) do go to Stiffler here Stiffler ask everyone to rate their own looks on a scale of 1 to 10 you cannot pick seven
() 
(4:23:01) rate your own looks scale of 1 to 10 starting with Aya 4.6
(4:23:06) 4.6 is there anything past the six Like A 333 like repeating of course
(4:23:13) no I mean probably but I don't know the number you don't okay what uh C uh Candace what about you oh my gosh I
(4:23:19) don't want to participate in this game there's no winning game there's no winning this answer there is definitely
(4:23:24) winning you can win you can win candas uh you got to give us something I'm not
(4:23:29) participating throw out a number so would that then CU if it's too L say I'm
(4:23:34) a three that that means I lost the game wait what was the question correct
(4:23:40) I say I'm a three that means I lost the game M yeah I guess is that what that would
(4:23:48) mean who did I lose too I guess you're breaking the rule she's losing to the whatever podcast
(4:23:55) yeah yeah I mean the so th this uh I think does require a little bit of
(4:24:01) clarification so I think that a lot of the people who beat up on the whatever podcast about this question I think it's
(4:24:07) kind of silly so the idea is just would you just try to judge delusion right so
(4:24:14) you would probably say beauty subjective this type of thing I'm I have to do this
(4:24:20) I'll let you get right back to it okay yeah yeah I need to get the other answers before we get into it what about you comp big seven I'll go six okay what
(4:24:28) about you I'm giving myself an eight especially Cons considering a 43 go ahead girl okay I and you can't
(4:24:36) pick seven yeah I'll go six okay what
(4:24:44) with or without makeup just give a how about with and without he's going to bring out the baby
(4:24:50) wipes soon yeah care I'll take it off um I don't know tonight I'm feeling
(4:24:57) myself so I'll give myself an eight that's with makeup yeah and then
(4:25:02) without makeup like a four okay what about you uh I'll say six my sister's a
(4:25:09) 10 okay what about you um we we can't back seven so I guess eight okay I give
(4:25:15) myself a five Andrew what about you uh well I mean there's actually some
(4:25:21) pretty good honesty on this panel I think uh so I'll actually give you the actual rating I would give myself about
(4:25:26) a four maybe a five yeah Andrew didn't mean to cut you off there Andrew didn't
(4:25:32) mean to cut you off there I just wanted to get the answers from the rest of the panel before we well this is this is something you see from feminists often
(4:25:38) they they want to be very hypercritical of the idea of the rating right and
(4:25:44) they're like well it's nebulous it's a it's like ah not really I think people understand it pretty well what you're
() 
(4:25:50) asking is is the self uh you know the self obsess or how how do I phrase this
(4:25:58) right the self assessment is the self assessment mapping onto reality or isn't
(4:26:03) it right so when you say did a survey on this specifically that's to see how delusional people are calm down calm
(4:26:08) down with your surveys I know I know but calm but I know how how delusional people are yeah yeah they are they are I
(4:26:15) mean it's true right thing is is like they often actually will lie and know
(4:26:21) that they're lying if there's a social group around them which reinforces that lie right so if there's no judgment
(4:26:28) going towards them from the people around them they'll actually lie often on purpose because it's reinforced now
(4:26:33) this is notoriously true of women in a room but not notoriously true of men
(4:26:39) they tend to not really do that because the man next to them will be like what the [ __ ] are you talking about you're fat or the man next to him will be like
(4:26:44) what the [ __ ] are you talking about dude you got half your face is missing or what are you talking about your teeth are jacked up right they'll instantly
(4:26:51) look at each other and just beat the holy hell out of each other be like dude you're full of [ __ ] and it's obvious
(4:26:57) you're full of [ __ ] but for women they don't actually do that they'll actually reinforce things they don't believe
(4:27:02) themselves so uh for instance let me ask a question to the entire panel just to kind of demonstrate this have any of you
(4:27:10) women uh do you agree that when women are around each other they judge each other all the time nonstop that this
(4:27:17) happens constantly that women will judge each other on looks on outfits on all
(4:27:23) sorts of different things on which eyelashes are better which makeup is better they don't say it out loud but
(4:27:29) you're just judging it in your head do you agree that women do this do you not do that with everybody yeah men and
(4:27:36) women do that I'm not saying that men and women don't do it I back the
(4:27:41) question you agree that women do do this in a form of comparison just like anyone else yeah okay great so can we agree
(4:27:49) then by a show of hands that women do that do women judge constantly
(4:27:55) constantly I don't know about constantly practice not being judgmental it's really hard to do but you know it's a
(4:28:01) it's a okay well let me ask you different way raise your hand if you've ever sat at a table with women and judge
(4:28:07) them definitely raise your hand okay so that that's everybody here right now
(4:28:14) raise your hand if you sat down at this table and judged any other women and judged the women one person it depends
(4:28:20) on what you mean by judge I know the judge the Judgment sounds judging their looks their looks is what I mean you
(4:28:25) judge their I think Concept in your head anyway so real quick I'll ask again now that you know what judgment means in
(4:28:31) this Contex no I don't oh you don't okay so I I just want to clarify legitimately judging whether or not their makeup
(4:28:38) looks good or doesn't look good or if they should have worn a different outfit or should have worn
(4:28:43) I you're making a judgment of beauty standards no for me it would not be judgment it would be more comparison it
(4:28:50) would not be oh they should have worn this Jud no there's yes it is you're correct comparison is a form of judgment
(4:28:56) but what you're talking about is much more harsh of like ew oh like versus like oh did they they look nicer than
() 
(4:29:04) I so there's sure sure yeah that's all I'm saying there is some Nuance to what you're saying say that you think okay
(4:29:11) well then let me ask at that raise your hand if you sat down at the table and thought that there was a woman at the table who looked better than
(4:29:18) you okay great raise your hand if you sat down at the table and thought there was another woman there who looked worse
(4:29:23) than you so wait a second so then how come it
(4:29:29) was when I asked if you sat down and judge the other women at the table none of you showed your [ __ ] hands but you
(4:29:36) judge a trillion thoughts a day it's not I mean it's that simple every single time right no it's not like judge means
(4:29:43) a couple things sometimes there's like a sensation of disdain no listen sometimes there's a sensation of disdain and this
(4:29:50) is what people refer to when they say the word judge uh and sometimes it means like s sort of evaluation like you're checking your position in the hierarchy
(4:29:56) and definitely the latter but not the former and I just didn't know which one you were talking about as well sometimes I have you seem a lot less confused now
(4:30:03) why is there a woman thing though anyway men do constantly too so I guess I'm a little confused as to why this is a a
(4:30:09) female thing it's not not what's your point then who who do you think is your looks match hang on hang on chill out
(4:30:14) let me answer one question at a time calm down so I'll answer hers first and I'll move to yours so the I asked this
(4:30:21) question right raise your hand if you judge women so like well okay what do
(4:30:27) you mean by judgment I clarified that and he said well not all the time so then I asked this follow-up question I
(4:30:32) ask you well um raise your hand if you
(4:30:38) judge the woman at the table you say none of you raise your hand then I say well rais your hand if you sat on the
(4:30:43) table and thought that another woman who was there was more attractive than you and you all raised your hand therefore all of you were admitting you made a
(4:30:49) judgment so you all [ __ ] lied every one of you I also logic stream isn't very good also on the way here I had a
(4:30:55) thought to I think it's fine I think it's pretty good it's not though it really isn't would you like me to explain how it's not I can't wait to
(4:31:02) hear it okay well basically you said the word judge and then it was kind of unclear what you meant and then I would
(4:31:08) have raised your hand if you had said the thing that you meant uh but you didn't and then that's that's pure cope
(4:31:13) so I did I did actually reiterate what I meant and I said I was judging based on beauty standards if you're making your assessment about beauty standards which
(4:31:19) you then later admitted you veryy is is what you're what you're doing what you're doing now is an even lower tier
(4:31:25) form of pedantry because you can rewind the tape and see that I specifically with you hang on with you specifically
(4:31:32) clarified exactly what I meant the rest of the panel heard it and then that's when I asked the followup question not
(4:31:39) clar confused you said words that were not but I was so hyp specific you were not
(4:31:46) the followup question everybody knew what I meant including you yeah the followup question was a great
(4:31:51) specificity I really like the follow that's when we found out the two things didn't we if you would like to say that
(4:31:57) checking yourself in the hierarchy is Judgment I'm very happy to agree that I judge people I'm not like I'm not fighting over the word I just really
() 
(4:32:03) wanted to understand what she meant yeah I don't think you were confused about what I meant I was I am reporting that
(4:32:08) very honestly we were further further able to demonstrate that by me verifying and then the second that I did the
(4:32:14) question the same exact way as every other woman on the panel it doesn't seem like you I think you being dishonest in
(4:32:20) the way that you are arguing I I'm very happy to admit your point but it feels like you sort of want to act like I'm
(4:32:26) being trapped in some sort of like verbal Corner which I don't think is really what's happening uh but I'm happy
(4:32:31) to say that I judge things according to your definition in my world though we what we call that is cope and welcome to
(4:32:37) cope because what you're doing you're coping it's okay for you to cope so listen it's all right for you to cope
(4:32:43) it's okay yeah you got you it's true I logically navigated you through this I
(4:32:49) know it's difficult for you to admit right but it it is the case what I'm showing is that I'm demonstrating that
(4:32:55) all of you [ __ ] lie to me and and I don't even blame you right I understand the reason if we expand our definition
(4:33:01) of lying then sure there's a reason there's a reason why all of you did that and I did the reason is is because it's
(4:33:08) very easy for women in Social Circles if one woman lives and the rest of them reinforce the lie for them to continue
(4:33:14) with the LIE men seem to be more more commonly women seem or men seem to call
(4:33:19) out when men are telling lies right they go no no no that's [ __ ] [ __ ] what like men would be laughing at each other
(4:33:25) if like let's say A man was sitting in chair one which a panel them in and the man was like oh I'm a 10 the other dud
(4:33:31) here would be like what the [ __ ] are you talking they would start ribbing him immediately doesn't work the same way with women that's why the answers are so
(4:33:38) are so bizarre from our view we're like what the [ __ ] are they talking I agree that women are significantly more like
(4:33:44) responsive to social pressure and much more likely to lie to each other about their their appearance I think this is true it's like kind of weird because
(4:33:51) like your end goal is something that I don't actually think is that off it's just want to argue with me to argue I
(4:33:56) get it uh I don't think I really like arguing for arguing sake well I mean that's arguing for
(4:34:03) argument sake are you do you know what you're saying or do you are you like an
(4:34:09) argument llm what's an llm uh large language
(4:34:14) model what's a large language model uh a large language model is a like a
(4:34:19) predictive text algorithm like trained on specific stuff uh I would like to give you props
(4:34:25) to asking I think some people would sort of Disguise when they don't know things um but I think that was like a high integrity do I always want to know
(4:34:31) exactly what I'm talking about before I talk about it which just proves your your prev I would like to say that I
(4:34:37) would like to admit when you are good at things and then also say when I think that you are bad and I think that was a good move and I'm trying to be
(4:34:42) consistent according to my principles great and consistently I'm really good at what I do and this has been proven
(4:34:48) now to you multiple times you got caught in the Trap the same way everybody else did for the same reason everybody else
(4:34:54) did I did not CU you lied and so because you lied you got caught in the same trap
(4:34:59) that's the way it works you have an interesting definition of lying but if we given your definition of lying then sure we can say that what do you think
(4:35:06) my definition of lying is you haven't even asked uh wa okay could I ask what is your definition of lying why did you make the claim about whether or not I
(4:35:12) was lying with I had an assumption about not even asking for it before you said that I was uh that was probably an error
(4:35:19) uh could you tell me what you mean by lying probably
(4:35:24) was what's that could you tell me what you mean by lying yeah sure whatever your definition
(4:35:30) is we'll go with that uh my definition is like knowing like having a belief and
(4:35:35) then saying something contrary to that belief oh perfect inally ring uh that it
(4:35:41) does not describe Des my internal State yeah no I think it externally did because what happened was you got
(4:35:47) clarification on a question after you got the clarification on the question you answered the exact same way that
(4:35:52) everybody else did because previously you were asking question that everybody understood including you you gave a
(4:35:58) different answer I did not understand it you were doing something inconsistent with your internal State I I was not
(4:36:04) doing anything into I got clarification on a question and then updated my answer that seems like pretty good Norms to me
(4:36:10) pretty good communication I mean to me and most regular people they would just call that a lie but okay
(4:36:16) fair enough all right I have two chats coming in here we have Jason Cassel chair 4 so you would be okay with your daughter selling herself so a bunch of
(4:36:23) Deens can get off do you even realize how horrible that is and why that makes you a horrible mother be a better
(4:36:29) mother you're quick do you want to respond uh no I have no response into into the mic if you can but no I have no
(4:36:35) response I don't feel the need to validate my motherhood to anyone okay all right uh thank you uh
(4:36:42) Jason we have Lucas here the talking point that Andrew only beats up on Meek women's patently false he debated sank
(4:36:48) uger on Piers Morgan Infamous atheist Matt dillah Hunty Dave Smith Destiny etc
(4:36:55) etc etc yeah we already established I did the bow and everything and again I didn't know about your other show until
(4:37:01) um you did we all did the circle intros so again I apologized oh yeah it's all
(4:37:06) good thank you Lucas do appreciate the message uh all right let's uh the rating thing really quick um no I don't think
(4:37:13) we were there were like tens here right no none of us said 10 like eights a couple eights or something but uh okay
(4:37:20) um and then just one last thing on this uh oh well actually uh Candace you
(4:37:26) just you kind of like refuse to answer it right cuz like it's stupid I I don't like that you can say attractive or
(4:37:31) unattractive right I would I'll answer that one but I think when you do a number so binary I I would prefer that
(4:37:38) cuz and I think Andrew is trying to like I keeps hting that I'm a feminist I'm really not like there's there's not a
(4:37:44) bucket I'm going to go in you know that's fair I'm not going to hint you are a feminist I'm okay that's fine I I
(4:37:49) I would I I just didn't want you I didn't want you to think it's being around the bush or trying to make inferences or implications that weren't
(4:37:56) there I'll just flat say got it you definitely are a feminist okay well that's okay that's your perspective um
() 
(4:38:03) putting a number onto it you're going to have most women that are going to either like AA said there's going to be a
(4:38:08) disproportionate amount of people that are delusional themselves like a really high number but you're also have the
(4:38:14) ones that are see it as a trap I'm going to be modest and go low so that no one thinks I'm egotistical like there's no
(4:38:21) winning by picking a number essentially like either like oh she picked low because she doesn't want us to know that
(4:38:26) she's narcissist or she picked High look how delusional she is it's just not a game I'm interested what what if she picked a number that was you know if you
(4:38:34) pulled a thousand people was fairly commensurate with what those people pulled and what she actually could be
(4:38:39) accurate and if it was what what if she think she's a six mhm and then a bunch of people some give her seven some give
(4:38:45) her five bunch of people give her six I don't know if that would be losing I mean she thinks she's a six and nobody's
(4:38:51) like oh okay oh you're overrating yourself like I don't think we don't like typically like it's when a girl
(4:38:59) who's clearly not a 10 claims 10 like otherwise if like a girl is like ranks
(4:39:04) herself like one point higher we don't be like I don't care whatever well yeah and then the the feminist nod was like
(4:39:09) he was like beauty is saying that I was going to think that beauty is subjective and to a point if you're talking about
(4:39:15) art or something sure but I think when you're talking about a person there's the golden ratio people are usually attractive or not attractive across the
(4:39:21) board and then there's you know both ends of the spectrum that'll be exceptions to that rule but yes I think
(4:39:26) that beauty traditionally is is objective so that was just a f yeah I mean I I guess the the reason we asked
(4:39:34) the question is because I think in the dating Marketplace you need to have a sense of where you stand in it mhm like
(4:39:42) if you have a house and you think it's worth 5 million you put it on the market
(4:39:47) the market says this is 1 million you're not going to sell the house and I'm not saying that women are houses it's purely
(4:39:52) an analogy but um I do think that there is a a uh something going on
(4:40:00) whereby uh I mean if you look at the woman's Instagram for example all her friends are gassing her up in the comments oh my God you're so beautiful
(4:40:06) blah blah blah blah blah you're amazing slay Queen Etc uh this woman could be
(4:40:12) fairly I'm not saying this to be mean to this hypothetical woman she could be completely unremarkable not particularly
(4:40:18) attractive she could be just average right um women tend to gas each other up
(4:40:23) and there's another component here that I think is really interesting is that um like if I approach a girl M and let's
(4:40:30) say she's just like obviously more physically attractive than me I'm getting instantly rejected like I
(4:40:38) don't that's not with M huh not with me not Lily get your chill out
(4:40:47) man um but no if a guy steps to a girl who's just like out of his League uh and
(4:40:53) you can consider League looks but you can consider other things too and I think it is other things too especially men yeah just looks but if a guy steps
(4:40:59) to a girl that's out of his League instant like nothing he doesn't get a conversation he doesn't get a date
(4:41:06) he doesn't get a kiss he doesn't get sex M the same isn't really true for women though MH if a as a woman you step to a
(4:41:13) guy who's outside of your league whether it's on a dating app you slide into his DMS or at a bar or whatever and you are
(4:41:20) in essence in the same way that men are like enthusiastically wanting to have sex with you if you as a woman make
(4:41:25) yourself sexually available to a man they'll take up that opportunity not
(4:41:30) look Not all men will but they'll take a lot of men will take up an opportunity to have sex with a woman who's
(4:41:36) enthusiastic and interested um so but they'll get rejected on the back back
(4:41:41) end men get rejected on the front end like I say if I step to like a 10 out of
(4:41:46) 10 I ain't getting anything from her whereas women if she's maybe average looking if she steps to a guy who's
(4:41:53) 7even eight n she might not she's not going to get every single good guy who's a seven eight or nine she might end up
(4:41:59) sleeping with with one or two or three uh maybe multiple times she'll
(4:42:05) get one two three hookups maybe he'll even keep her around in the situationship for 3 to six months she'll
(4:42:11) never get commitment women get rejected on the back end and so what ends up happening though is I mean if you have
(4:42:18) these women who are getting sexual access and they feel like they're so close to getting that relationship with
(4:42:25) that really attractive guy oh man and they just they keep chasing after him a couple things happen one they are
(4:42:32) getting that sexual satisfaction with somebody who's out of their
(4:42:38) league how are they going to feel when the guy who's actually willing to give them
(4:42:43) commitment they're going to be less attracted to him the sex is not going to be as exciting or she's not going to be
(4:42:49) as um immersed in the sexual experience she's going to be thinking about like this other really hot dude or like the
(4:42:55) 1020 other really hot dudes that she had casual sex with that just were unwilling to give her a relationship and so what
(4:43:02) ends up happening well a couple things end up happening she has an overestimated sense of her looks because
(4:43:07) she oh okay I can sleep with a guy who's an eight or a nine airG go I must be an eight or nine no not how it
(4:43:14) works the the sorry I'm losing my train of thought here the W for the woman is
(4:43:19) commitment mhm like that's your league the guy who's willing to give you Commitment if just because a guy's
(4:43:25) willing to sleep with you one night if he's a nine that doesn't make a woman a nine but so what ends up happening is you got these women they go out it's
(4:43:31) really easy to get sexual access to men who are more attractive than you we see this all the time with like famous actors musicians athletes they'll like
(4:43:38) gladly sleep with like a woman who doesn't match up to them in any regard
(4:43:43) like an average woman can like maybe not average but like they can get with an
(4:43:48) NFL player we have like 19-year-old college girl who's like just attractive we've had them on the show they've
(4:43:54) hooked up with NFL players NBA players maybe you guys have your own experiences where you've like been DMD by like
(4:44:00) famous musicians or athletes or actors some of you live in LA you know like these men like you have access to these
(4:44:06) men are they going to give you commitment not necessarily how are you gonna go like date Leonardo Dicaprio and
(4:44:12) then end up with like a normal dude like your brain is totally fried like I don't think in the same way that if you lived
(4:44:17) in a luxury apartment and then you're going to go live in the dorm room with three other people and share a bathroom and it's
(4:44:24) really hard to like have that certain level of treatment or experience when these women are dating really attractive
(4:44:30) men and then be like oh okay here's the guy who's actually will here's the cohort of men who are actually willing
(4:44:35) to commit to me uh but they don't like they're not as attractive as the men who are willing to sleep with me they don't
(4:44:41) have as much status as as these men who are willing to sleep with me so I do think having a reasonable assessment of
(4:44:47) your own physical attractiveness would like indicate is a really good idea that I go [ __ ] like this rock star and then
(4:44:54) I'm going to be like completely sexually dissatisfied with like Joe scho average guy because like most average women are
(4:45:00) not attracted to average men that's my position maybe you disagree I don't know you've heard women talk about having
(4:45:06) this experience hm you've heard women talk about having this experience like like when they're trying to date I've
(4:45:13) had thousands of women who've come on the show and they're like completely average and they're like oh yeah this
(4:45:18) famous guys like in my DMs and like I dated XYZ I dat an NFL player I did an NBA player yeah they have that
(4:45:24) experience and I I was just curious about the difficulty finding commitment part well what I'm what I'm saying is is
(4:45:30) like when it comes to female hypergamy is they can find commitment but the men
(4:45:36) it's like how often do you hear women say something like oh the guy that I like he doesn't like and the guys that
(4:45:41) like me I don't like them like those are the guys who are willing to give them commitment so they can find commitment
(4:45:47) they just don't want it with those guys they're continuously chasing after these men and from like 18 to 30 they'll be
(4:45:52) chasing after these men like situationship situationship one night stand Friends with Benefits boom boom
(4:45:59) boom not saying this is the case for all women plenty of women throughout their 20s will be in long-term relationships
(4:46:05) but like this is the experience of a lot of women and then ultimately when they're 30 they're like oh okay I'm going to get married now now and then
(4:46:11) they're just totally dissatisfied with the men who are actually willing to commit to them because they spent like their 20s [ __ ] these like NFL NBA
(4:46:19) players and so forth and I'm using that as an extreme example but it could just be like the like really attractive guy
(4:46:25) in your college that all the girls want yeah I think I was just checking if
(4:46:30) this was like an like a specific anecdote that you'd had to more like Theory General observation you'd notice over like extrapolating I mean this is
(4:46:39) this is uh something that I think is observed in the dating Marketplace I mean the statistics from the dating app
(4:46:44) seem to indicate this that women are uh overwhelmingly swiping on like the top 10% of men on dating ABS yeah I know I
(4:46:51) think this is definitely true I think I was just curious I'm like trying to figure out how much of a bubble I'm in basically so I was just curious like if
(4:46:56) the thing was a general thing like you have access to the same information I have or if you're like yeah I've been talking to swim and they're like well I
(4:47:02) was trying to find a relationship when I'm 30 but I [ __ ] all these really incredible guys and like why can't I find a man as good as I was [ __ ] well
(4:47:08) I mean do do you think that this could be a phenomenon where like once you've experienced a certain level of uh um
(4:47:17) treatment or like dated a certain like caliber of guy it's kind of like hard to
(4:47:22) be be like and maybe you do end up settling with that other guy but like in the dark
(4:47:29) recesses of your mind you're like still like ah you still oh man this guy was better in like this Dimension maybe it's
(4:47:36) the guy is he was really generous or he's really good in bed big dick whatever it is like he's really tall
(4:47:42) really good-looking status he took me on all these trips and then you start creating an amalgamation of like all the
(4:47:47) like most amazing characteristics that like 10 different guys who you dated all have and you're like okay I need that in
(4:47:52) one dude mhm yeah I think it's a possible Theory I I I think there might be some other theories that explain
(4:47:58) what's going on but I I genuinely really don't know which one's the right one yeah sure I mean there's all kinds of ways to approach like the dating
(4:48:04) Marketplace and everything that's going on but or or like for example an alternative hypothesis might be like I
(4:48:11) there's a lot of men that I dated but I sort of like in hindsight feel like I
(4:48:16) really should not be dating them anymore in a way that's possible you could argue that I've like downplayed all their good qualities so maybe we have a
(4:48:22) psychological phenomenon where we like sort of don't remember how good people were because we're like [ __ ] those guys or something um I don't know if that's
(4:48:29) actually what's going on I'm just giving like something that another theory we could test yeah well can I ask your question like have you had like is there
(4:48:35) one partner in particular you've had who was like the most amazing in bed definitely my current one what's that my
(4:48:41) current one definitely your current oh your current one okay um how about like prior to him was there a Gap where like
(4:48:47) you had a really amazing sexual experience with a certain guy and then like guys after him like did not
(4:48:53) sexually satisfy you and because they didn't like meet meet to that standard or that caliber of the previous men you
(4:48:59) were like sexually dissatisfied uh to a minor degree yes okay I mean most them
(4:49:04) kinky so like I've like had a sex with the kinky guy and then I had sex with vanilla gu vanilla like man I wish I had
(4:49:10) sex with kinky not as fulfilling right but but I mean you you did have that experience yeah this is true I think
(4:49:15) it's plausible yeah yeah and then like question were you while you were dating these men maybe not necessarily during
(4:49:21) sex were you thinking about like oh man this other guy was way better you're doing comparison not
(4:49:27) really I'm abnormal like I don't know if I'm representative possibly like I can I'll give you a personal anecdote yeah
(4:49:34) like I think this can happen to men too um so um so my God I can't believe I'm
(4:49:41) uh Andrew e muffs I feel or I don't know never mind you don't have to do ear muffs so it's like okay in the same way
(4:49:47) that like women once you fall on like you you're you're playing Russian roulette you're like rolling the dice and then you land on like the dick you
(4:49:55) know it doesn't like he's just that good in B you know this
(4:50:01) [ __ ] okay and you we got some bu I sorry
(4:50:07) I'm by yeah yeah you what uh look all [ __ ] is good but some [ __ ] is
(4:50:15) better than other like I don't know like a woman who's like multi-orgasmic who can come in like 5 seconds and then she
(4:50:21) have like multiples and like come like 20 times in a row and it's super easy and then you're going to like deal with
(4:50:26) a girl who like you need to [ __ ] Jackhammer to like make her come like a quarter of the way to a climax it's like
(4:50:32) okay that's kind of like you've been you've been accustomed to a woman who can come and then like that also feels
(4:50:37) really good both like physically and psychologically in ter terms of the psychological stimulation um so it's
(4:50:44) kind of like once you you know it's like ah how do you go back to like the woman who's like mult you know obviously
(4:50:50) people are more than just like the sexual experience there's other components to a relationship like do you get along with them are they a good
(4:50:56) person uh are they Pleasant so it's not just the sex but I'm just like within that realm of like
(4:51:02) sex it's hard to go from like multi-orgasmic [ __ ] crazy and then
(4:51:07) you're going to date the girl who's like she do really get that way and it's like impos it's like super hard to make her
(4:51:13) Cal it's like [ __ ] are you having this problem right now oh my God okay look I have yes I've
(4:51:19) encountered a woman who's like incredibly insanely orgasmic and then I've also like subsequent to that dated
(4:51:25) a girl who like she can even make herself come right like some women are just it's hard really hard for them so
(4:51:33) but I I feel like where a lot of women have this problem kid know where a lot of women
(4:51:38) have this problem where they go from someone that they're you know having great sex with and really into and have this great connection with to like then
(4:51:45) going maybe downgrading and you know having a bit of [ __ ] sex it's because usually they go from you know being in a
(4:51:51) relationship seeing someone long term cuz I feel like as women we enjoy sex
(4:51:56) more with a partner the more we have sex with them like it does get a lot better Lear yeah yeah and so when you go from
(4:52:02) like seeing someone and being with someone for quite a long longterm thing and then like maybe you know you're
(4:52:07) sleeping around a lot and it's like oh my God these [ __ ] guys are [ __ ] [ __ ] in bed it's not cuz you're they [ __ ] in bed or you you've got a bad
(4:52:14) connection with them it's because you spent so much more like time and effort with the person before yeah yeah I agree
(4:52:21) with you that there's more to like a relationship than strictly just the sex and absolutely sex can improve and you
(4:52:27) can work on it and it can be better um but uh I'm just saying you know yeah I mean
(4:52:34) I also feel like a lot of the times with just like oneoff things like they they
(4:52:39) don't care about like you they just care about themselves like and that's why we want the guys that are committed because
(4:52:46) they actually don't treat us they'll learn and they'll take the time to like 100% yeah word all right I got a couple
() 
(4:52:54) chats I got to read um Shooters sheets Candice is honestly so hot that
(4:53:00) it makes it worth the ear damage do you want to respond to the to this candas no
(4:53:06) no okay we have Lucas uh shooter thank you for the uh
(4:53:11) message shoter really appreciate it man uh Lucas Aya you're a bright oh Aya you're
(4:53:18) bright girl but you're engaging in bad bad faith pedantry the quintessential Bill Clinton depends on what the meaning
(4:53:24) of the word is is do you want to respond super quick to this uh I mean I just
(4:53:29) want to know what people mean I it's really genuine sure Jason I think that that's fair to always get clarification
(4:53:37) on what a person means that the portion where becomes pedantic is if the person gives you what they mean and then you
(4:53:44) refuse to accept what they mean that's when it becomes P if that did happen that's we we have Jason Cassell chair 4
(4:53:51) we should care what kind of mother you are to your daughter you are on a live podcast and you told the world world that you are okay with your daughter
(4:53:57) being a prostitute I would say that that is evil do you want to respond that is not what I said you completely twisted
(4:54:02) my words would you be cool if she was like getting like driven around by her though uh no sorry did I just say that
(4:54:10) that was a completely different scenario that she described with addiction problems and things so I would also love
(4:54:16) to respond to this cuz as well like I feel like it affects me because it's also my like as in like my mom supports
(4:54:22) when I started owning fans and go ahead Lily my mom always describes it as like I can sit there and be totally against
(4:54:29) it never speak to you again you know never have a relationship relationship with you anymore but it's like that
(4:54:35) would be way more heartbreak than you know if she actually supported me in something I enjoy doing and a happy with
(4:54:41) like would you you would way rather have that than I I have a question for you would you if you knew before you had
(4:54:48) started doing o new definitively like maybe you had a conversation with your parents and your parents said Lily if
(4:54:56) you do this our relationship is over we are done you're out of our Lives we're
(4:55:02) never going to talk to you [Music]
(4:55:08) again um [Music] would would you have not done only fans
(4:55:17) if this was all before before and they're like you went to them and you're like I'm thinking about doing
(4:55:24) this I think it's hard cuz I would not have then experienced what Joy this has
() 
(4:55:31) brought me so I I wouldn't have then like known you know is this going to actually be the career for me so maybe
(4:55:37) it would have but then again I also think that if your parents gave you an
(4:55:44) ultimatum it would just make you want to choose the thing that like FS them off the most yeah 100% if your parents are
(4:55:50) going like I will never speak to you again if you do this as a teenage girl at 18 I of course I would have took it
(4:55:56) why but but so it it wouldn't so you would you would have taken the choice the choice to just
(4:56:03) start your only fans knowing the entailment being the relationship with your parents is irreparably damaged it's
(4:56:10) over like for life would you still do it it depends cuz right now I know I know
(4:56:15) the joy this job brings me and so I can't put myself in that head space that I was when I was 18 how about this what
(4:56:21) if I mean wait that makes wait wait a second that makes no sense so if it is
(4:56:26) the case they don't want you to do only fans and then you're going to do only fans but then they say they're going to
(4:56:32) disown you and you're still going to do only fans why would it be a problem to
(4:56:38) because it's it's the same result either way right right say that again sorry you were laughing a bit too much if it is
(4:56:44) the case that if they give you an ultimatum you would do only fans but you're going to do only fans without the
(4:56:50) ultimatum then what do they lose by giving you the ultimatum I I just meant in the sense of
(4:56:57) like well my parents then lose me if they get me this ultimatum they lose contact with me so
(4:57:04) so the IDE so the idea here is if they give you an ultimatum for behavior that
(4:57:10) you're not going to talk to them again so they have to concede to your behavioral standards I I feel like I'm I think I'm
(4:57:18) confused with so if I have a behavioral standard for a person if you do acts I
(4:57:23) don't want to be a part of your of your life right this is bad from my view like
(4:57:29) I don't know murder let's say something like this if it were the case that I
(4:57:34) gave them the ultimatum and then they went and did the activity anyway versus I did not give them the ultimatum and
(4:57:41) then they still went and did the activity what the hell do I lose by giving them the ultimatum it sounds like
(4:57:46) giving them the ultimatum at least shows them where it is that you stand you know what I mean no cuz then then if you gave
(4:57:52) me the ultimatum then we say like you and my dad we never then we never talked again so then you would never get cont
(4:57:59) that would be you saying the behavioral standards of me you need to accept
(4:58:05) versus them saying the ultim the behavioral standards I have you need to accept so basically you're just usurping
(4:58:12) behavioral standards from your parents right you're saying you need to either concede to my behavior or else so it's
(4:58:19) actually you giving the ultimatum no but at the end of the day it's my career it's my life it's my job
() 
(4:58:25) this is yeah a choice I get to make it's you know it's not it's a choice you get to make but you're saying if you don't
(4:58:31) agree with the choice get the [ __ ] out of that's definitely you can't choose who your children are right they turn
(4:58:36) out like if you can pick and choose who your babies are your job as a parent is to protect them and to love them and if
(4:58:43) you could eat me Mighty Mo and pick your perfect child no that's not the job of a parent I mean I'm sorry I think
(4:58:49) unconditional love is very important when raising children no no I just I
(4:58:54) just feel that this is the job of a parent I think one aspect of parenting would be to protect your child and to
(4:59:01) love your child but love has many uh facilitations as to what that means I
(4:59:07) think that holding uh standards for behavior is part of love and I think boundaries is part of love I think that
(4:59:15) uh I think I think that holding standards for behavior is part of loving somebody the idea that if you love me I
(4:59:21) can do whatever the [ __ ] I want regardless of your beliefs to me is insane that's like that's the opposite
(4:59:27) of love to me but I I think because my parents love me so much they would way rather see me in a job I enjoy than you
(4:59:34) know something I would hate and it' make my life miserable and you know it make me depressed they would though if it if
(4:59:43) it's if it here's what I mean I'm thinking in my head if you were going to do something which was against my
(4:59:49) standards as my kid right for Behavior this my parents never laid down that law that was I understand I I understand
(4:59:56) your situation this may be different you did kind of make it sound like they but anyway that aside if it is the case that
(5:00:03) I'm like this behavioral standard is unacceptable to me and they're like well I'm going to do it anyway and you can
(5:00:09) either [ __ ] deal with it or not right then it's like well yeah there's an ultimatum I guess on my side but there's
(5:00:15) also an ultimatum on theirs right so the thing is is uh for my view though
(5:00:21) shouldn't a parent kind of Hold the Line shouldn't the parent be like no this Behavior nonsense needs to stop [ __ ]
(5:00:29) that it's damaging to you it's damaging to society and I'm not going to indulge in any of it like how's that not love
(5:00:36) but you're how's it love to just be like do whatever the [ __ ] you want that that doesn't sound like love the thing is though a parents are there to guide them
(5:00:43) not just absolutely abandon them you know and things like that well they would be the kid abandoning the
(5:00:49) parents no because are say standard and the kid is saying but I'm not going to
(5:00:55) adhere to it and unless you do I'm not going to deal with you anymore isn't that the kid abandoning the
(5:01:01) parent I don't believe so well no cuz nobody really asked to be
(5:01:06) born you know like we're all just that's like oh I can just say well I didn't ask to be a parent you know what I mean but
(5:01:13) but whether you whether you ask for it or not it is just in case you were born it just seems to me like the
(5:01:20) responsibility putting all the responsibility especially if you're an adult on your parents right like you
(5:01:25) want a relationship with me I'm not going to adhere to your behavioral standards or else that's I mean how do
(5:01:31) you not have culpability for this supposed abandonment right but the thing is you're you're an 18-year-old you're
(5:01:37) an adult like you your parents can't give you an no and tell you exactly what to do at that age yeah they can they can
(5:01:43) give you an ultimatum for the restrictions of the relationship they're willing to have with you based on behavior of course like if a parent said
(5:01:50) if as long as you're out being a serial killer I'm not going to have anything to do with this is not murder I'm not saying it's Mur don't compare it hey
(5:01:57) stop stop I'm not saying it's murder what I am saying is that they have the right to say if you're engaged in this
(5:02:04) ex Behavior I find a warant I'm using murder because it's easy to understand right I'm not going to have anything do
(5:02:10) with you nobody would blame them but I think that would make them a bad parent if they just abandon them like that I
(5:02:16) think it makes you a bad kid to give an ultimatum for abandonment the kid isn't the one giving the automation though the kid is
(5:02:23) actually the kid is saying I'm not going to conform to the behavioral standards if you want me in your hang on if you
(5:02:29) want me in your life you will concede to my behavioral standards that is actually
(5:02:35) an ultimatum but it's just it's just like a uh agree to dis grieve their
(5:02:40) views like the the kid thinks that's that's totally fine to do and the parent
(5:02:45) doesn't right right so the the thing is here is uh if the parent says this is
(5:02:51) not right you the the problem I have here is that the the counter claim is well then you don't really love them
(5:02:57) it's like that seems stupid to me it seems like yes you can definitely really
(5:03:02) love a person and not agree at all with the behavior they're you never talk to your kid again if they sex do with them
(5:03:09) until the behavior changes why is that even bad so so if you had a a child and
(5:03:16) you know I have eight sorry I don't know your background or no no go ahead you
(5:03:21) can ask the question go ahead and you know she turned 80 in and decided that
(5:03:27) she was going to take this route in life and do only funds are you then giving them an alternatum and saying I'm not talking to you again if you if you I
(5:03:33) think I think that me saying you're not conforming to behavioral standards that I find acceptable uh and you can either
(5:03:38) do that and have a Rel relationship with me or not is the same exact thing they're saying to me so I think they
(5:03:44) would be saying the same thing to me that I'm saying to them so this seems Mutual to me or like both parties are
(5:03:50) giving this ultimatum it's not just you it's not just them so if that's the case yeah I don't I don't see a problem with
(5:03:56) that if one of my kids said to me I'm going to go off and be a prostitute I'd say well here's the thing I will always
(5:04:02) love you there's nothing I can do I can even do about that if I wanted to right I'll still always love my children but
(5:04:08) that doesn't mean that I'm ever going to to support any of these behaviors and until these behaviors stop I'm not going
(5:04:14) to enable them you wouldn't ever talk to your kid or anything like will they be at Christmas dinner what's that so will your your gay
(5:04:22) or prostitute kid be at Christmas dinner but I I I personally deem that as
(5:04:29) like a bad a bad parent if you're just going to abandon your kid like a bad kid because the kid not really cuz they're
(5:04:36) not doing anything wrong doing sex work isn't isn't inherently what is the parent doing wrong then by
(5:04:42) this metric what are they doing that's wrong abandon their child that's not
(5:04:48) abandonment of yes is if you're not talking to them anymore you won't see them if you're 18 years old okay well
(5:04:54) cutting off a relationship you want to call it if you're 18 years old how the [ __ ] are you abandoning a child okay
(5:04:59) well you you're cutting off all relationships then yeah so what why is that wrong well don't you put off
(5:05:05) relationships with people based on behavioral not when not when well not when they're my family my parents why
(5:05:10) why not because they're family what do you mean I would I never not talk to my parents doesn't matter what they do for
(5:05:16) you what would make it wrong for you my parents could kill someone based on Behavior why would that even be wrong
(5:05:24) why would that even be a problem because family it's not it's not all about like right and wrong you know you love each
(5:05:29) other unconditionally yeah exactly what do you mean unconditionally
(5:05:34) yeah have you ever had unconditional love do you know what that feels like yeah let's say you love them
(5:05:40) unconditionally you haven't demonstrated this person doesn't love you you've only demonstrated cut means hang on hang on
(5:05:47) you haven't demonstrated they don't love you you've only demonstrated they won't give into to your behavioral standard
(5:05:52) that's it they still love you I think we're just going so in this if honest cuz agree to disagree I think it would
(5:05:59) be unloving if my parents cut me off I think it's unloving that you won't conform to their behavior of standard
() 
(5:06:04) well cuz I won't stop porn like what oh CU they because you demand that they accept porn
(5:06:10) my my parents well my my personal parents don't demand I stop porn so that's so let me ask you a question Lily
(5:06:16) if you go off and you do corn you still love your parents yes okay so why would
(5:06:21) it be the case that if your parents stopped talking to you because you went off and did corn that that meant they stopped loving wait wait take that back
(5:06:28) so if I did corn I still love my parents is that the question I I do corn love my
(5:06:33) parents so why would your parents stop loving you just cuz you did corn even if they stopped having a relationship with you why I'm not talking about my
(5:06:40) personal parents aren't like this but you're you're saying you're saying basically you would abandon your child
(5:06:47) and I think I person de that that you don't love your child if you will never speak to them or see them again they
(5:06:53) years old are they still a child pdon if they're 35 years old are they still a
(5:06:58) child oh your your child your kid whatever you want to final Point final point on this so so here's the thing you
(5:07:04) keep on you keep on saying you're abandoning your child as though this is a three-year-old oh sorry I sorry I'm using the terminology my parents still
(5:07:10) call me a child cuz there's no abandonment Lily you're not abandoning you're saying until you conform
(5:07:17) terminologic what terminology what terminology would you like me to use for
(5:07:23) someone your child no as your child then if you don't want to use word child yeah
(5:07:28) but the reason that you're saying child is because you're infantilizing it like what word would you like
(5:07:35) me how about this then how about this use the terminology your adult child
(5:07:40) okay see how that sounds you're abandoning to you by having a behavioral standard for your adult child are
(5:07:47) abandoning your adult child say that out loud so you're abandoning your adult child cuz they do porong so you don't
(5:07:53) love them anymore that means you don't love them anymore yeah but it doesn't mean that the kid stops loving them
(5:07:59) because they won't conform to their behavior we're going to go around in circles because we're going to agree to
(5:08:05) disagree I believe that if you were to abandon your child because they did porn that you don't love them anymore okay
(5:08:11) well let me ask you a question just one last question before Brian wraps this up is it at least from your view possible
(5:08:18) that a parent can absolutely love their child and still cut off contact with
(5:08:23) them based on Behavior I I personally don't think I don't think that would be Ling no I think if you choose to be a
(5:08:30) parent were a PDF file I think if you choose to be a parent you you love that kid till it dies I didn't say depending
(5:08:37) on depend on what what it does I didn't say listen I literally conceded the love thing I'm asking you this question well
(5:08:43) I think you stand you stand by your child even if they're PDF files I don't
(5:08:48) know what PDF files oh yeah kid you go after kids I my parents have always said
(5:08:55) even if I kill someone they would still start by me you stand would so you would stand by you think that a good parent
(5:09:00) stands by their kid even if they're pdfi they yeah they still love them and talk to them I didn't say anything about love
(5:09:06) well they still talk to them they won't cut off contact now you can still love your kid but that doesn't mean you have
(5:09:12) to accept the well they they would still keep contact with them that's what I'm trying to say why why do they need to
(5:09:17) keep contact with them what because they're their child and they have chosen to be a parent at the end of the day as well oh like we can go around in circles
(5:09:24) about this all right last question I I lied okay so last question this has to be the last it has to be the last last
(5:09:30) one last one could you conceive of having a boyfriend or an ex-husband who
(5:09:37) what do conceive me hold on let him finish let him still who still is in love with you but stops talking to you
(5:09:44) what does conceive me rephrase that maybe can you think
(5:09:50) that it's possible that there could be an ex-husband or boyfriend who is still in love with a woman but stops talking
(5:09:57) to her yes but that is so different that's so different the relationship is people even if you cut that type of
(5:10:04) relationship is so different I see but it is possible to get off contact with people in oh my God
(5:10:11) but yes but that type of relationship is very different Len to me my sperm made
(5:10:18) you makes it so that it's suddenly not love but if my sperm didn't make you I still could love you what what part of
(5:10:24) that actually makes sense do you want to keep talking and going around in circles
(5:10:31) yes it's so I bet it's so boring to listen to I hope all your kids turn out just how you want Lucas says Lucas says
(5:10:37) Candace if you have a public platform you make public assertions about someone you have a duty of due diligence
(5:10:42) otherwise you're CNN fake News Network do you want to respond or I mean
(5:10:48) I don't know how many times we have to beat a dead horse you know what I mean okay yeah uh we have Jason chair three
(5:10:54) doesn't sound like your parents love you God damn Jason chill out bro um sounds like they don't really care about you are you chair for's daughter tell damn
(5:11:01) this is not the roast session yet chill out guys holy [ __ ] we'll get to the rast session in a moment then say save Jason
(5:11:07) save it for the rast session okay um all right here I do have a request of Aya
(5:11:12) Aya have you seen the movie American Pie no you haven't seen American Pie that's
(5:11:19) homeschooled you can yeah um there's this line can you say this
(5:11:26) one time at band camp this one time at band camp it was okay all right never mind
(5:11:33) just sometimes the the flow of your like kind of the what's the word for it Cadence thank you uh it reminds me of uh
(5:11:42) her the uh Alison Hanigan I think from American Pie so the band camp girl okay
(5:11:49) I need to get through all the oh actually wait we did do the rating thing yeah uh I think I pretty much wrapped up
(5:11:54) on that the only question I have follow up on that is do you think you'll be better looking better looking in 10
() 
(5:12:00) years time you're 32 will you be better looking in 10 years time at 42 no definitely not okay and you're 32 were
(5:12:06) you better looking at 22 than you are now at 32 uh uh better looking at 22 Okay C uh
(5:12:14) Candace you're 35 better looking in 10 years time at 45 no and then you're 35 were you better looking at 25 than you
(5:12:20) are now no better looking now okay uh you're 23 better looking in 10 years time at 33 I think I will be yeah better
(5:12:27) looking in 20 years time 43 paron wait uh would you be better
(5:12:32) looking probably not no okay maybe but yes at 33 I might have a lot more work done so it depends you have work
(5:12:38) currently or yeah yeah lips lips lips is it the no I haven't had my lips done why
(5:12:44) do they look nice I don't know thank you you're 43 better looking in 10 years time at 53 oh okay you're 43 were you
(5:12:51) better looking at 33 than you are now at 43 no better looking now mhm okay what about 20 years time uh better looking at
(5:12:57) 23 versus 43 no so better looking better looking now at 43 versus 23 yeah I think
(5:13:05) so when you take the whole I'm thinking of all the things not just like sorry talking just looks just looks so you
(5:13:11) can't factor in like personality being ethically nonous prob no they probably
(5:13:16) better at 23 okay uh you're 21 do you think you'll be better looking in 10 years time at 31 possibly but probably
(5:13:23) not okay uh you're 35 better looking in 10 years time at 45 no no sorry no was
(5:13:31) that no yeah it would not be and then you're 35 were you better looking 10 years ago at 25 I didn't have the
(5:13:36) confidence I do now so just looks though don't worry about the conf confence oh honestly I use an anti-aging

(5:24:36) I'm not talking like I'm talking like the kind of women like that you know I use and like that they
(5:24:44) um what's when I say ratchet women I say women who um
(5:24:49) TR are uh strumpets harlots yeah like just
(5:24:56) like I'm trying to sum it up in so many words um baby have babies as pawns you
(5:25:05) said ratchet hoes yeah just yeah just say that ratchet who
(5:25:10) like and it's just yeah it became so like I became tainted and I was just
(5:25:16) going to I just started treating them the same way they treated me um so if they were busy I got busy too you know I
(5:25:23) had other things going on I didn't keep it I didn't I kept them on like ice or
(5:25:29) whatever you want to call it like I was I answer their calls and text them back and show up when they needed a friend um
(5:25:37) but I didn't put all my eggs in their baskets and it took like a good guy to come around um to make me drop all of
(5:25:46) them and that's you dropped them I did you dropped the yeah and you know what I'll tell you right now and I know
(5:25:51) you're not going to believe me but I didn't it wasn't all just sex like it's not I'm not like a super frisky kind of girl like I wasn't like that for me like
(5:25:58) it was just about uh being there for friend and it wasn't had didn't have to
(5:26:03) do with I wanted to [ __ ] or I was horny or anything like that it was the pity [ __ ] we talked about
(5:26:09) right the beginning that that's what that's what it was though like ah my friend yeah he's going through a hard
(5:26:15) time damn suck is De like what is that is that what it was y
(5:26:21) yeah so oh okay yeah those my show notes that's what I thought you were going to read like now it's holy
(5:26:29) [ __ ] have any of you been pity [ __ ] like the GU like oh
() 
(5:26:35) God I guess a [ __ ] you know uh yeah yeah when I was pregnant [ __ ] well it
(5:26:41) because when I that sounds really bad when I was pregnant with my third I wanted sex every day it was it was
(5:26:48) insane while you're pregnant yeah I it didn't happen with my first two I was like wildly insatable I already feel that way now but it was it was insane
(5:26:55) with my third and that's I mean that's actually common Brian yeah and I literally wanted I wanted hor I know he
(5:27:02) didn't say it was ever a Pity [ __ ] but it was definitely he told me like well releases uh releas tons of hormones uh
(5:27:10) that's why they have bizarre cravings and [ __ ] like that you know put GIF peanut butter on Doritos and all kinds
(5:27:15) of crazy [ __ ] so those those hormones yeah sometimes uh that's the way it
(5:27:20) leans pity and more of I can't keep up with you but I'm going to give it to you anyway I see okay that that makes sense
(5:27:28) have I ever done the pity Funk probably okay good talk uh let's
(5:27:34) see final notes Here for Katrina finally uh you asked when you guys ask what our
(5:27:40) number is referring to body count what do you mean do you mean the number of
(5:27:47) D's we effed or effed us do B blow blow's count do you mean
(5:27:54) the number of men who have gotten me off do you mean the number of guys that uh non-consensual we I mean person
(5:28:02) I don't I don't I don't think that counts if it was n i I didn't say that though I said oh
(5:28:08) well you sorry you said pressured you into it or took advantage of you so it's still consensual wasn't I wouldn't say
(5:28:15) consensual it was um like I felt like I had to do it so or like to get out like
(5:28:21) I've been in positions you know with guys be like give me a BJ or have sex with me or I'm going to tell your
(5:28:27) boyfriend you did anyways you know so that's not I mean that's uh I'm just
(5:28:33) saying there there's a word for that and like that's probably yeah so like my number is higher than I want would like
(5:28:40) it to be um because I've learned from all of those mistakes that I but you
(5:28:46) know I'm not a victim I just put myself in shitty situations and survived as Miss Pamela Anderson would
(5:28:54) say and uh I learned from them and I like I said earlier I don't enjoy or
(5:29:00) like like I felt like I next guy that I was to be with um would have to be
(5:29:07) pretty dope for me to put my number up for them okay um wait I actually uh sort
(5:29:14) of tangential to this but like do you think let's say you're dating somebody
(5:29:20) and like there's maybe a differential in sex drive and like the boyfriend there's never been like it's
(5:29:27) always been consensual but like the girlfriend is starting to like slowly withdraw and the boyfriend says she
(5:29:35) really likes him though and she wants to stay with him but like there's a mismatch when it comes to the sex and the boyfriend's like I I really like you
(5:29:42) but we're not having as much sex as I would like with that would you consider that like press pressuring a girl to
(5:29:51) have like if he's like look I'm dissatisfied with our sex life
(5:29:56) like if like I'm going to have to leave you if it doesn't improve like would that be
(5:30:03) like pressuring I guess it would be but is it like
(5:30:09) no because you're being honest I think that you just have to admit that not everyone's compatible and specifically
(5:30:14) sexually compatible so I think that's more admirable than lying about it but what if she stays with him and she like
(5:30:19) UPS the amount MH I that's consensual like she UPS the amount I don't think it's pressure but she's
(5:30:26) like that's not as much sex as she would otherwise want to have so is that like a compromise or is that like kind of I
(5:30:35) think they should be getting into the bottom of like why woman doesn't feel the need to like want sex I mean like
(5:30:40) maybe she's has a really low sex drive or she's like partly a asexual yeah I
(5:30:46) mean I've been in it where it's like the other way around and I've wanted sex a lot more than the guy and it can be
(5:30:52) hurtful it sounds bad but it can be hurtful when like I feel hurt when a guy doesn't want to have sex with me because
(5:30:59) it's like why would you want to have sex with me and it's like you know sometimes you just have to realize that you do have different different sex drives and
(5:31:05) masturbation is key um that's personally my thought okay um
(5:31:11) I I'll just move this on hot take from you last thing you said if you give sex away for free you might as well get paid
(5:31:17) for it ain't nothing worse than a broke ass hoe in my opinion yeah your words
(5:31:24) not mine yep so have you ever no I'm a [ __ ] broke I'm broke
(5:31:30) so okay I don't get paid if I was going to give it away for free I would get paid for it like but you said ain't
(5:31:36) nothing worse than a broke broke ass ho exactly but but I'm broke ass ho broke but you're not a hoe right broke ass
(5:31:44) yeah not a hoe yeah exactly okay okay just clarify seriously but if you're
(5:31:50) going to be a hoe you can't be broke ass yeah exactly got it okay just clarify
(5:31:57) understood understood okay you yeah that's where like H love the analogy yeah it's good
(5:32:03) it's good okay Danielle you said one of your exes was a hardcore
(5:32:08) oh God masturbate her and he always wanted to masturbate especially to Asian porn huh when I am a thicker woman we
(5:32:16) were together for four or five years you found out a year later he still has his addiction and has a kid uh they're
(5:32:24) separated the the new girl they got separated because of his hardcore masturbation still yeah to this day so
(5:32:31) would he like try to watch that [ __ ] with you no honestly it's I kind of
(5:32:36) found out about it because I came home and there was a laptop on his chest and his dick was out and he was asleep and
(5:32:44) like was it but like how did you know it was Asian porn because it was on his laptop oh you saw it I thought you heard
(5:32:49) something like it was Japanese porn or something no it's uh it wasn't it was just Asian porn I didn't
(5:32:56) see but I noticed and then I was kind of like oh like maybe it's a oneoff type of thing
(5:33:02) and then I kind of noticed it was all the time and like if I came home home
(5:33:08) and I wanted to know like I'm tny whatever and then he's already done it and I was like oh okay and he's just
(5:33:14) like one of those type of guys that like come and come once a day you know they can't you know wait was that the only
() 
(5:33:20) time you caught him with hising multp and he always Asian it was
(5:33:25) always as always Asian and like skinny Asians like not like super and I was thinker and this is one of the reasons
(5:33:31) he actually broke up with me is because he wanted to get fit and I wasn't in a position at the time to get fit because
(5:33:36) I was going to school fulltime and I was working two jobs and it was just like a lot and um oh me so horny me love you
(5:33:45) long time pretty much and um I happen to
(5:33:50) be friends with one of his friends that uh unfortunately I still hear about him and I I have seen him over the years
(5:33:57) because we do have mutual friends and I'm very civil with all my exes sure but
(5:34:04) um it's to this day it's like to the point where he lost custody of I'm just curious like
(5:34:11) would it have been better if like what if they were still skinny but it was like a white chick do you feel better or
(5:34:19) worse um and what if it was a Latina or a Native American go through all the RAC
(5:34:25) fact yeah like any because I am a thicker girl like I just find because he
(5:34:31) was watching always like smaller girls and the fact that he wanted to get fit and all that stuff like it kind of it's
(5:34:37) like like you know we're a couple we can better each other type of thing or maybe and just overall like the fact that it
(5:34:43) was always skinny people in the porn kind of like threw me for a loop because I'm not skinny and if that's what he
(5:34:50) likes then like why is he with me and so originally he broke up with me because
(5:34:56) you know he said you know I want to get fit and all this stuff and I was like okay no problem and then like he did
(5:35:01) this huge thing where he won me back in a sense where he you know bought me flowers he did this huge like gesture of
(5:35:07) like like I'm so sorry like I [ __ ] up and then I was 20 at the time so like
(5:35:13) I was young and this is my high school sweetheart and I was like okay sure and but I don't want to be one of those
(5:35:19) couples that break up and get back together a thousand times that's not the not what I want and so overall we got
(5:35:26) back you know what you should have done was he a white guy he was a white guy yeah the white guy you should you should have thrown it back in his face and just
(5:35:32) started watching like big black Co and just
(5:35:38) on laptop and he comes home he's like [ __ ] just [ __ ] yeah yeah just throw that
(5:35:46) in his face you know yeah no but uh overall we opportunity didn't work out and then left each other yeah and uh
(5:35:54) then I found out the partner he had same thing and never stopped you said that you went on the first date and the guy
(5:35:59) started talking about how his ex puts peanut butter on her um yeah on dating
(5:36:07) off pretty much I've only really three people like why would you not that damn
(5:36:13) why you that sounds like a part no because it's like not first date
(5:36:18) material you think when you go on a first date you know you talk about yourselves whatever it's like oh you're bringing up the my
(5:36:24) [ __ ] literally he and then the fact that he like thought I would still kind
(5:36:29) of like he's like sends me like a dickpic later that night and I G and I'm
(5:36:35) like it's not hot like you talking about your ex and how she used to get off from her dog is like not what dog when did
(5:36:43) the dog get R miss the wait what about the
(5:36:52) dog it wasn't the boyfriend no she put peanut butter on sorry I got mixed up I
(5:36:57) thought it was the boyfriend not the dog wait maybe I
(5:37:02) missed that out wait his his ex so his girl like his ex girl his exgirlfriend
(5:37:09) she put the peanut butter peut butter on her vagina and let her dog god be I
(5:37:14) thought you were talking about no that's like first date material where that's why I'm not [ __ ] talking to this man
(5:37:20) ever again all right that's crazy it's like you think I would like who thinks that's
(5:37:25) okay it's like I don't want to be your ex she's [ __ ] into beastiality or whatever yeah uh we have Carly here uh
(5:37:34) Carly you said you were with a guy for 5 years and he cheated on you within at yeah we talked about that um cheat on
(5:37:40) you with yeah you said a lot of guys in Los Angeles only date models so they can say they're dating a model we call them
(5:37:46) modelizers like from Sex in the City isn't like they're fetishizing you yeah
() 
(5:37:52) but like an actual model or just a girl who like did like one or two shoots and she's like claiming model me no not you
(5:37:59) I'm not talking about you people yeah I mean just literally anybody that like claims that they are it's like the
(5:38:05) weirdest thing cuz the second that I like like you know broke up with my ex and whatever and started like dating
(5:38:11) around again that was like the first thing that anybody ever mentioned anybody ever talked about like that was
(5:38:18) like it for a conversation about me and like and then I'd be like oh like have
(5:38:24) you been with like other people that are models before and they would always be
(5:38:30) like yeah my ex was a model and my ex before that and then like people will always be like or I've heard guys be
(5:38:36) like I like yeah I only date models blah blah blah but it's they don't have to actually be like a real model they just
(5:38:44) have so wait you've had multiple encounters with men who say they only date models oh yeah like at least like
(5:38:49) five at least that's interesting I've never heard that one uh only date only
(5:38:56) date models yeah I think it's like mainly I don't know maybe just in La I don't know but I mean you were in I
(5:39:03) thought it was that was fake I saw it in Sex in the City when it came out I didn't know that was a real thing yeah I thought it was fake too like I
(5:39:09) did not think that was a thing but apparently uh you said you uh maybe like
(5:39:15) uh wait maybe like long-term relationships and knowing when a relationship has become more of a
(5:39:20) friendship than a romantic thing and dating again after long-term relationship oh so we're like it like
(5:39:25) dead bedroom is that what you're talking about like you're dating a guy and you stop having sex or well it was more like
(5:39:31) sounds like it I mean a little bit maybe maybe oh yeah wait is it like you didn't
(5:39:37) want to or he didn't want to yeah like cuz after so like so long
(5:39:43) and if you're with someone who's just like not like does not treat you well and whatever I don't know why I still
(5:39:50) stuck with him whatever but after a while it was definitely just like a friendship but then he's like come on
(5:39:58) like oh he was still trying to but oh you were not yeah you're over it sounds like it you said you have a take that a
(5:40:05) lot of younger guys especially in fraternities are emotionally gay like they're only interested in what other
(5:40:10) men think and if they like them or not yeah L like ly sometimes they they well
(5:40:18) just in the terms of like they only seem to care about what other guys think and
(5:40:24) what how other guys feel and how their friends are feeling and how these guys that they're like really really close
(5:40:31) with feel but they'll like dat a girl show it off to all their friends so they'll think they're cool but they
(5:40:37) won't actually like give a [ __ ] about their girlfriend the girl yeah I mean I think some I I mean I think this is
(5:40:44) perhaps the case for both men women like men like if you're dating an attractive woman that gives you a certain level of
(5:40:50) status among other men I don't think that should be the like that's like super low at least for me that'd be like
(5:40:56) kind of irrelevant or super low on the totem pole but I'm not really public like that with my like if I'm dating somebody but um but I almost think
(5:41:04) though isn't it I feel like women are way more more concerned about the Judgment of other women when it comes to
(5:41:10) their partner than the reverse like I feel like you guys need the coign no we date the boys you need no but you maybe
(5:41:16) not even looks but you need the cosign from your female friends but you do it anyway you still date whoever you want
(5:41:22) even if your girlfriend kind of hat them you still do it anyway it's more just to like sure get some uh you said porn in
(5:41:29) social media has made men objectify women to the point of no longer being able to actually have feelings for women even
(5:41:35) if they're straight sexually yeah like that just kind of ties back into like the emotionally gay thing I
() 
(5:41:42) just feel like a lot of times guys just like literally cannot see women as like human beings that are equal to them not
(5:41:48) necessarily all the time and it's not necessarily like super common but I've seen it a lot and I feel like it
(5:41:53) definitely does happen and it's just like not talked about and that's why a lot of relationships might be kind of
(5:42:00) [ __ ] I mean that's how it was with my sister like God her ex is just
(5:42:06) consistently or like like that like would only talk to his friends but then would come to her
(5:42:12) like when it was time to like hook up oh so they're okay I mean I mean that's
(5:42:20) more like hookup culture I think but I I guess when it comes to objectification I mean when it comes to
(5:42:26) like porn and social media I think there are men who are objectifying women but a lot of these women are just objectifying
(5:42:32) themselves um sexualizing themselves and it's like the modeling Beauty the like
(5:42:37) modeling Beauty sex industry it's like so dominated by women these women are just yeah I mean I'm not I don't know if
(5:42:43) that's what you're talking about I mean I'm not saying it's not I'm just saying like the whole thing is like you know it's not great
(5:42:52) for well I mean I think like there are a lot of men have like porn brain and
(5:42:57) they've just been like and they follow all these like IG chicks on Instagram and they're like liking the photo this
(5:43:03) is a really common complaint I hear from women like oh I don't want to dat a guy who's like following all these IG girls
(5:43:09) and liking their photos like I feel uh uncomfortable or insecure in the relationship and I I mean but my prescri
(5:43:16) prescriptive advice is like as men you shouldn't be following girls on
(5:43:21) Instagram I mean you shouldn't be watch I don't think like my personal approach
(5:43:26) I don't think men should watch porn or at least limit it like substantially
(5:43:32) yeah I mean I definitely agree with that it's a lot harder to have an emotional connection with a woman when you're just
(5:43:38) constantly seeing women in that specific area you got I I mean I don't if I'm in
(5:43:45) a relationship I don't watch porn at all um and I you got to save your energy for
(5:43:50) your girl like you can't be I agree off yeah yeah yeah you need
(5:43:55) to come on like I hate when people are like this though what do you as in they only bust up once like in a day I feel
(5:44:02) like you need to actually like work for it and get to that third not cuz then
(5:44:07) meaningful the guy or yeah the guy I don't know I'm 35 I'm maybe when I was 18 you know 203
(5:44:15) okay I'm good one a day I'm okay I feel like when you get there though it's the
(5:44:20) better orgasm the third fourth fth I'm like in pain after [ __ ] God damn when was the last
(5:44:27) time you tried when's the last time honestly I
(5:44:33) can't believe I'm going to answer this [ __ ] question um when's the last time I've had three organ
(5:44:39) hold on let me think yeah you're lazy if you just mouth That Got Away there's this one
(5:44:44) girl she just oh don't know was [ __ ] Trump the first Trump Administration how

(5:44:57) okay sometimes I don't know look after what once got to work on that men lazy
(5:45:04) these days why Y no hold on just to be clear just to be clear first the girl has to come first if possible she's going to come multiple times but I'm not
(5:45:11) trying to have like sex 10 times in the night she has to do my laundry she has
(5:45:17) to do chill out chill she she has to do my La there's time for her to do my
(5:45:23) laundry and bow and cook dinner okay that's the time that's also it's like
(5:45:30) sex it's like okay look you've had sex sex is great don't get me wrong sex is
(5:45:36) great right but it's like how about the other like 12 hours I'm spending with you like you have to make yourself more
(5:45:43) appealing than just having a [ __ ] not some of us that was not some
(5:45:49) of us I don't know I don't know um I can't imagine you having sex you I'm
(5:45:55) trying to picture in my head that's don't visualize it I don't consent to you
(5:46:00) visualizing I do not uh I'm undressing you with my eyes that's crazy um should we draw fan
(5:46:08) art later uh what what was I I don't know where I was going with this why did I
(5:46:15) why did I reveal this um terrible I do apprciate move on I did I did have a a
(5:46:21) quick question as I was I was thinking about this so Lily kind of back to this other thing we were talking about just
(5:46:27) briefly very briefly I was thinking about how this sounds out loud if if I said if if my daughter came
(5:46:35) to me and she was like dad I want to [ __ ] a thousand dudes in a
(5:46:41) day to set a record H yeah and I was like well honey that's against my moral
(5:46:47) values and if you do that I'm going to have to distance myself from you because that's disgusting and gross would your
() 
(5:46:54) response actually be why don't you love me Daddy I never see we're going back in this
(5:47:01) circle again that I say when I say it out loud it actually
(5:47:07) sounds even worse if so your daughter comes to you you're you're a man and
(5:47:13) says I'm going to [ __ ] 1,000 men in a
(5:47:19) day and he's like listen this is completely there there is nothing morally wrong with [ __ ] a thousand
(5:47:24) guys in a day he says this is completely against my moral code if you do this
(5:47:30) until this Behavior stops I don't I don't want anything else to do with you stop after a day really you think that
(5:47:36) that's him not loving you like really so for me personally if I was a parent and
(5:47:42) my child want to do sex work and that would then be my thing to be like okay I
(5:47:49) want to I want to guide them through it I want to you know make sure they they get all the information I don't just
(5:47:55) want to abandon them and UNL them you know what I mean like I I think it makes no sense D I want to [ __ ] 1,000 men a
(5:48:04) single day honey please don't do this this is reputationally damaging to you it's horrible for our family it's awful
(5:48:10) what you're doing please don't do it if you do I got to turn my back until you at least stop this Behavior daddy why
(5:48:17) don't you love me like really does that even make sense to you we we oh my God we're going to go around in circles like
(5:48:23) I'm going to agree to disagree I firmly believe that as a parent that like you should always love and stick by your
(5:48:29) child what whatever they go through and whatever they do yeah no but I haven't agreed you
(5:48:36) disagree like if you agree to disagree we both agree but I I haven't actually heard your disagreement does that
(5:48:42) actually sound correct to you that I don't want to keep arguing with you cuz I know I know what I believe in I don't
(5:48:49) the thing is I don't really care to keep arguing with you because I'm not going to change your opinion and you're not going to change mine there's tens of
(5:48:55) thousands of people hundreds of thousands perhaps Millions who will watch the clips of The Exchange here who
(5:49:01) do want to know the answer and the so I do want to know the actual answer here the answer to but dad you just don't
(5:49:08) love me because he turned his back if you [ __ ] 1,000 men in a day do you actually stand behind that [ __ ]
(5:49:14) people that's not him loving you hang on hang on let me ask a question do you actually stand behind the fact that
(5:49:20) that's him not loving you 100% yes I think you should Stand by Your Child whatever they
(5:49:26) do all right thank you it's all that's all I
(5:49:31) had okay uh let's see if there's anything more here with Carly your notes
(5:49:39) um yeah men should stop watching porn no offense to you guys that do that thing
(5:49:47) but um I I I feel like it this is a pretty common uh
(5:49:53) standard uh for women or maybe even the preference I think most women would prefer if their
(5:50:00) boyfriend wasn't watching porn yeah I mean I feel like that is pretty
(5:50:07) standard uh you said that you have a take that higher body count on a guy girl actually makes for better long-term
(5:50:14) relationship material I forgot I wrote that yeah you did write that yeah low key cuz I don't know in the guy or in
(5:50:21) the woman or both it doesn't matter doesn't matter cuz I mean I feel like well as long as it's like you know
(5:50:27) they're clean whatever um yeah but why why does it make for a better long-term relation a they've like had experience
() 
(5:50:33) they've been around they've seen things they know what they like they know what they don't like they know what kind of
(5:50:39) people they get along with they know what kind of people they don't blah blah blah and so then like if they're wanting
(5:50:44) to get into like an actual relationship with you and like genuinely just stick to you then like they're more likely to
(5:50:51) stick it out in a relationship yeah well I mean there is like the SE sexual compatibility component but like when it
(5:50:57) comes to knowing what you like in terms of a person I don't know if you
(5:51:02) necessarily need to have sex or have sex with a lot of different people to be able to make determinations as to like
(5:51:07) personality assessments no not necessarily like I definitely agree that you don't have to you know have like a
(5:51:13) high body count to be a good partner right I just think that you know there's a lot of stigma around that and a lot of
(5:51:20) people are like oh so do you think body count like should not matter I mean
(5:51:25) personally for me it doesn't matter like M but other people have like their own
(5:51:30) opinions and their own takes um and do you think men who do care about body count do you think that
(5:51:36) they uh insecure for caring about it um I mean maybe like a little bit I think
(5:51:42) it's mainly like if they keep bringing it up and they like compare themselves
(5:51:48) and they like just you know it's like a little thing like an issue that you
(5:51:54) can't get rid of then that's like going around the table uh do you think body count matters and do you think men who
(5:52:00) do care about body count who maybe would disqualify a woman if she had a high body count whatever that that might be
(5:52:07) for him do you think that would be him being insecure starting with you Aya uh yes it would be him being
(5:52:15) insecure but also I strongly defend the right of people to be insecure and I think this is f preferences okay I think
(5:52:21) this is good uh Candace what do you think um I don't think it matters um I
(5:52:27) don't think the body count matters I'm more interested in like why person's having sex or a lot of sex um cuz you
(5:52:34) can I think you can do the same thing with different intentions and yeah I I
(5:52:39) would agree I think everyone has the right to their preferences so if someone doesn't like a high high body count that's totally fine but I do think that
(5:52:46) there tends to be a link to some insecurity with that sure but again if you link it to like just like bad behavior and decisionmaking in general
(5:52:53) and then you see a pattern that's like not just isolated to sexual encounters and that would be worrisome for sure
(5:52:58) okay Lily what about you what do you think I do kind of think body count matters but more in the way of it makes
(5:53:05) you a better partner in bed like you would want boxing lessons of the guy who's had a thousand fights versus the
(5:53:12) guy who's had one fight wouldn't wouldn't you want though
(5:53:19) in a boxing match to box the guy who has no boxing experience so you can lessons off
(5:53:26) lessons off sorry I know I know but I was just changing the analogy a little bit but okay so uh body count to you
(5:53:32) doesn't matter as in I I think it does matter because I think it makes you a better better partner in badge I see
(5:53:40) okay what about you I don't think it matters I think that patterns matter though which is kind of speaks to what she was saying so if someone's like
(5:53:48) almost like you see a sex addiction pattern where it's like they're just every other night finding a new person to [ __ ] that type of pattern matters to
(5:53:54) me much more than the body count okay and are men who who do care or would
(5:54:00) disqualify a Woman based solely on her body count do you think that's are they insecure is it wrong I think it speaks
(5:54:05) to some insecurity I think again there's some preference there though too I think it's hard to analyze everybody's bra
(5:54:10) sure Carly well I think you gave your take right yeah what about you I think it's all circumstantial and
(5:54:19) individual I don't think that uh paint everybody with one brush everybody's different so to me it
(5:54:27) matters I don't judge people for their high body counts though do you think a man would be insecure if he cared about a woman's body count didn't want to date
(5:54:34) her because of it I mean if you're gonna date a porn star then I don't think you should care about her body count if you
(5:54:40) want to date not a porn star then but
(5:54:46) she has a high body count well she broke she's a broke ass
(5:54:52) home like [ __ ] broke ass hoes over here not you guys not you guys not you guys vaguely in
(5:54:59) general I think again like California are okay that's fine what about
(5:55:05) you um um yes 100% inse insecure for the guy to care about that oh no no he's
(5:55:12) yeah that's totally okay bodyc count matters is it in Body Matters I don't think it's about um I think it depends
(5:55:18) on the person but uh I think body count does matter because it it conveys what
(5:55:24) sort of quote unquote experience you have um I don't necessarily think it's insecure for a person to care about it I
(5:55:32) think um if they care about it they might have their own reasons
(5:55:37) okay all right uh well so uh some of you said body count
(5:55:44) should it matter doesn't matter uh curious to know what's your body count starting with our good friend Lily [ __ ]
(5:55:50) off come on what is it you think I know range give us a range
(5:55:57) range what was it last time can't remember what I said last time cuz last time I I still didn't count last time um
(5:56:05) I'm going to go right now probably between 500 to 1,000 that's the range i'
(5:56:10) 500 to 1,000 okay all right uh Aya and then we'll go around this way starting
(5:56:16) with you go ahead uh probably low 500s and 109 free wait
(5:56:21) 109 free like unpaid unpaid okay how many do you think paid or uh well I have
(5:56:28) a CRM but I have I haven't update in a bit so probably around 450 I think clients I've had do you have an exact
(5:56:35) number or not I can go look I did look up the exact number at one point but my guess right it's over it's about 500 uh
() 
(5:56:42) my guess is around 450 paid and around it's 109 specifically have a spreadsheet um unpaid 109 unpaid 500 paid okay uh
(5:56:51) 450 is 450 so roughly the total should be low 50s low 500s maybe 550 okay got
(5:56:58) it I want to claim more Valor than I have all right uh what about you um
(5:57:04) personal life is nine and for work I don't know cuz someone pulled up my I guess there's the uh an
(5:57:12) explicit version of IMDb basically and it says all of your scenes But it includes solos and I don't know if we're
(5:57:18) counting women um so that's all lumped in there yeah counting the scenes yeah yeah I don't know so when I first
(5:57:24) started working I would work with like 12 guys and that was it and just kind of go through that I was going to say this
(5:57:29) quite small pretty low for me so nine civilian life and you said like 12 I
(5:57:36) started with 12 and then towards the end of my career I added a couple cuz I was working in the UK a lot and they're
(5:57:42) different performers but it's not maybe 15 to 20 or something like that that sounds about right all right what about
(5:57:48) you I if I have to estimate probably between 23 and 28 23 to 28 okay mine's
(5:57:56) actually eight cuz I was in a longterm relationship oh okay eight because you
(5:58:02) were in a long-term relationship all right uh go ahead
(5:58:09) um I don't really want to answer this question you don't want to no I don't
(5:58:14) I'll tell you the amount of men that I've wanted to have sex with that I had sex with since probably about six or
(5:58:21) seven that I was like this guy is somebody I want to let
(5:58:26) in okay yeah wait didn't you say something about body count or like
(5:58:32) you're like asking like how do you count it okay um
(5:58:37) huh okay is that is that an answer I don't like it is cuz she's senting at
(5:58:45) non-consensual well like I wouldn't say like it was were some no she didn't actually say non-consensual no I said
(5:58:51) she's cting yeah it's just like it wasn't like that I it's like that I let or that I felt sorry for like you know I
(5:58:58) don't want to count those guys because um it wasn't something but if he if he did count those people he did actually
(5:59:04) consent to was that uh hold on hold
(5:59:32) on yeah so you were just saying that you
(5:59:37) don't want to include people where it was like pity sex or yeah or something like just that like but if you if you
(5:59:44) included everybody you consented to not like I wanted to that was like I like
(5:59:50) this guy do no hang on hang on not wanted to but consented
(5:59:57) to I think that's a fine line on that consent thing because um I don't want to claim like I
(6:00:06) was our SA or anything like that cuz I put myself in those positions um but I don't think that they
(6:00:14) warrant one of my numbers why not if you could I mean if
(6:00:20) you can sent the set I to me consent is like I'm horny and do
(6:00:27) that to me right now yeah but likeu isent like you know wouldn't you agree
(6:00:33) at least like pity a Pity [ __ ] is definitely consent
(6:00:40) um what if I like didn't like if I regretted it regret
(6:00:48) regret a lot of times a lot of times yeah yeah so when it comes to regret for
(6:00:53) instance there's many many cases I can site of women who regretted sleeping
(6:01:00) with a man the next day and then called it essay and then when it was it was clearly hang on it was clearly not the
(6:01:06) case what I'm asking is what the count is that you actually consented to that
(6:01:13) was not a
(6:01:27) it's I don't think that you're understanding my position when I'm letting you know that like I don't want
(6:01:34) to call it essay because I put my myself there but I didn't go there with the intention that I wanted to do
(6:01:41) that like it had happened because you know out of
(6:01:47) just like not leaving me alone until it happened or like you know um all kinds
(6:01:54) of different scenarios um and I learned from each one
(6:01:59) of them and I felt every time I got I walked away from those I felt like [ __ ] and I didn't feel um good about myself
(6:02:07) and so I didn't put myself in those positions anymore it kind of took me a little bit while to figure it out yeah
(6:02:12) there's this one time where I was in the middle it was in Hell divers too I was in the middle of this bug hunt and we
(6:02:19) were just destroying everything and it was great my wife came over and she's like let's go to the bedroom and I was
(6:02:24) like no I'm in the middle of Hell divers too and I'm just destroying everything and she was like no we got to go to the
(6:02:30) bedroom and I was like damn it and I went and I failed the raid and it sucked
(6:02:35) right right I couldn't believe it that this had happened right but it did and I
(6:02:42) totally consented to it so the thing is is like I'm not asking about your [ __ ] regret because I don't give a [ __ ] about your regret I'm asking if it
(6:02:48) was not essay what's the actual body count that's what I'm asking um
(6:02:59) I under 35 okay thank you I appreciate that what
(6:03:04) about you uh 21 um a single digit I've only ever been
(6:03:12) in long-term relationships but this between me and
(6:03:17) God okay all right we have Davon Jackson here what exactly is the insecurity I
(6:03:23) can be confident that I'm the best lay out of a thousand and still not want to date your nasty
(6:03:29) bunnies thank you daon thank you Devon I do appreciate the message Serv much
(6:03:36) appreciated we also have some super chats we have John John yo guys W's in the chat for John for the big

(6:04:24) I guess that's that's fair that's fair hasn't started yet from the very
() 
(6:04:30) beginning that's fair um uh so Candice you have an IMDb bio oh boy it starts by
(6:04:37) describing you as Buxom and shap leaf 53
(6:04:43) brunette knockout of mixed Spanish and Japanese descent how do you feel Candice
(6:04:49) being called Buxom I didn't even know what that was what is buckon I don't know I would be guessing I think it's
(6:04:55) like kind of it's like an energy thing right like like feisty oh no Buxom real
(6:05:02) smart um of a woman plump ESP especially with large
(6:05:08) breasts very flattering I don't know if that's flattering whatever no it's not none of that flattering uh let's see
(6:05:15) here you said that uh you see uh we'll save that for later um hold
(6:05:21) on uh body count really we were just talking about it I saw you were on this
(6:05:26) podcast uh you claimed that the average is five mhm uh and was this like based
(6:05:32) off of like other people data or like I mean you can probably Google it and like see what studies will pop up but it's
(6:05:39) referenced a lot in a lot of um like evolutionary psychology or like professional date like dating
(6:05:44) psychologist there's this one guy in Britain I can't remember his name he's got great hair he does all of the
(6:05:50) rotations but it was one of his podcast that he was going through the research I think he's in Cambridge maybe do you
(6:05:55) know the date of the cuz I've heard the five number since the like the 9s so no
(6:06:00) I I mean they were I don't know when the research was conducted no okay I actually thought it was pretty like and
(6:06:06) then I was wondering if people were being honest with self-reporting and then that's why I asked a earlier today I was like do you believe that it's five
(6:06:12) cuz that seems exceptionally low but I think it's also skewed because when you go online everything that generates the
(6:06:18) most views and gets the most um like it pops up on the most algorith algorith yeah the algorithms is um like
(6:06:26) the more salacious take so we think that being promiscuous is more common than it actually is I I've seen some other
(6:06:32) studies that put it a little bit higher like 7 hate I I still think that that's dubious though and then I also do Wonder
(6:06:39) like what is the age cohort of the people that they're looking at cuz I wonder if you're like pulling from like an like your your uh surveying like part
(6:06:48) of the survey includes like 70 and 80 year olds I don't know like how material that would be to like sort of the modern
(6:06:55) dating landscape what age would you be interested in what in dating no no no no like know to have the information I
(6:07:01) think like 18 to 40 is 18 that's still such a big gap it is and there's a lot
(6:07:06) of differences between like you know gen Z Millennial it is but like 18 to 35 is
(6:07:13) like I the cohort of people that are like more likely to be single that you're more likely to encounter uh when
(6:07:20) you're dating but um I have the data on this at least I mean it's a relatively liberal population so it's probably
(6:07:26) slightly inflated but it raises at least the median I mean if depending on if you want the Medan average raises to around
(6:07:32) 10 um when people hit about 40 so 10 at 40 yeah so my guess is it's slightly
(6:07:37) inflated but not significantly but I'm just wondering if they're like including the 60 and 70 year olds they're so far removed from the dating pool so the the
(6:07:44) the My Graph goes like this and it slowly evens out at 40 with a very slight increase at that point so like 50
(6:07:50) 60 year olds of my data we're closer to like maybe I think it was like 15 people or something interes but this is median
(6:07:56) not average so median is like when you split the population half and half and then average outliers can pull that up really high the average body count for
(6:08:03) older people in my data set specifically which again is liberal uh was around like I think up mid low 20s 20 something
(6:08:10) and when you say older people like 40 to 50 like people in their 50s and 60s my sample size for that was a lot lower so
(6:08:16) low confidence interesting okay and do you like if we're looking at projections do you think like people are 20 now do
(6:08:23) you think that that'll be their body counts when they're 50 or I me unclear like I didn't I didn't track across time
(6:08:28) it's possible that like different generational pressures will cause different body counts Yeah
(6:08:34) but I to me it's like I don't know going to
(6:08:39) college five I don't but going to college is in
(6:08:44) itself a big selection like but a lot of women like don't the majority of people go to college uh what is it like 60% of
(6:08:50) people and well there's more there's even more women who go to but like I remember when I was in college and this
(6:08:55) was before the dating apps granted I Santa bar is a bit of a
(6:09:01) party anyways maybe I'm biased a little bit here but um one the [ __ ] I saw
(6:09:06) anecdotally and then just like if a woman has a five body count in
(6:09:12) her first freshman fall quarter semester she's a saint
(6:09:18) like I mean not really but like that's kind of like it's kind relatively it's
(6:09:25) kind of low like where I grew up is extremely high I think this is very cultural like like the because I mean my
(6:09:31) own experience is like going out a lot of these girls Thursday Friday Saturday night they're in college they're
(6:09:37) drinking partying doing drugs and like I think actually there's some studies that indicate that uh like gen Z they're
(6:09:45) actually drinking and partying way less um I think there's probably a bunch of reasons for that but like when I was in
(6:09:50) college like it super super common like you were an outlier if you weren't like partying in college uh partying drinking
(6:09:57) in college right now it seems anyways with jenzie it's a little bit shifting a little different but like these girls
(6:10:04) would go out and sleep sleep with a new guy maybe once a week sometimes they do
(6:10:09) like Thursday Friday Saturday maybe one two three guys in a weekend yeah so for a girl to just like
(6:10:16) have a like you say the average is five I'm thinking back to my college experiences I'm like they do that they
(6:10:22) do 10 or 20 their fresh like their freshman year no I agree I I have
(6:10:27) serious doubts too it's just the person that was is I'm bringing up the study and I don't know if you can find it or
(6:10:33) not or like at least that podcast host that was um saying the statistic it didn't seem truthful no well a lot of
(6:10:39) the US is very religious I mean were those people going and partying religious like my guess is you like fell
(6:10:45) into a certain section of people that were likely to party all the religious people are staying home wait a second
(6:10:50) wait a second when you say a good portion of the US is very religious what do we mean by very religious do we mean
(6:10:57) that they self-identify as being religious or do we mean that they're actually practicing the religion yeah I
(6:11:03) think we could check maybe Church attend is a proxy I agree that there are a lot of lukor Christians uh I used to be very
(6:11:09) Christian I just the self ID is not going to cut it I understand the argument but even if you are just self
(6:11:16) iding and not walking the walk quite as hard still being in a culture that like really has pressures against it I think
(6:11:22) it's aist are in the same culture so that makes no sense right so atheists are in the same culture as the self ided
(6:11:28) Christians and if the self ided Christians aren't doing Church attendance or any of the Christian things then how are they not just in in
(6:11:35) the same culture that the atheists are I I agree but I think a good portion of the US does go to church pretty regularly which I agree is not proof
(6:11:42) that they are of the US doesn't go to the church or go to church regularly they go occasionally that's the vast
(6:11:50) majority of the self ID Christi the ones who are more rigorous have completely different stats right so
(6:11:56) the ones who are more rigorous they're going to have different stats when it comes to how many children they've had they're going to have different stats
(6:12:01) when it comes to STDs you're going to have different stats for all these things so it does seem that the more rigorous that you're practicing the
(6:12:08) religion uh the the more that this would be a determining Factor right so that's
(6:12:13) why I want to clarify whether we're just talking about self ID or actual rigorism because then the the numbers greatly
(6:12:19) change don't they uh yeah definitely I mean this is reflected in my data you are correct so I'm not willing to say
(6:12:26) then that the vast majority are Rel are are religious like you're saying then I
(6:12:32) think that that is almost STW maning your own position think I said majority but we can just check the you said the
(6:12:37) vast majority of are are religious uh I don't think I did but if I did I
(6:12:42) misspoke I think there a good chunk of the we can just check the we can Google it and if it's like oh it's 30% I'll be
(6:12:48) like sure I I'm down to say 30% but I just think that the best place for this is Pew right not just Google You' go to
(6:12:54) Pew research Pew research actually dove into this and looked at the rigorism versus the non- rigorism when it came to
(6:13:00) the studies and we can see that the more rigorous you are the more that these things actually apply to you versus your
(6:13:06) self ID the only reason I'm being hyp specific here because I know you love that is also because I I want to make
(6:13:13) sure that when you're giving out this data when you say to Brian well most people are are are religious or Mo well
(6:13:20) I'm not sure we got to be careful with that language right when you're giving stats especially your own I'm not giving
(6:13:26) my own stats for most people are religious I just thought there's a bunch of people in the US who are in religious culture and we're just generally not
(6:13:32) seeing them when we go to Party colleges if you're partying in a college and people are going out drinking you're probably not seeing good God-fearing
(6:13:38) Christians who are going to church they're not included in that sample well maybe they used to party but now they're
(6:13:44) Christian maybe Andrew calls this the great ho Reformation sorry I'm trying to
(6:13:50) do it in Andrew's voice but well I think it's a uh well okay so my my best like Protestant version is like so I do miss
(6:13:58) the Protestant fire and brimstone preatures the you're going to go straight to hell you Harlot like those
(6:14:04) guys I thought that they were kind of based I'm not going to lie uh but now it's become uh kind of this much broader
() 
(6:14:12) what I would would commonly refer to as the sewing Circle Christian and the idea here is I think that what has occurred
(6:14:20) is that because Christianity is designed specifically for the Reformation of the
(6:14:26) Soul it's the idea of regeneration the idea that no matter how badly you've sinned the Jesus Christ is still there
(6:14:32) for you that is true however there are a huge amount of women who try to utilize
(6:14:40) Christianity to buy a new reputation they think that because they have been saved now their reputation has also been
(6:14:48) saved and that's just simply not the case the right your reputation still your reputation so imagine for instance
(6:14:54) uh if a priest was a PDF which that happens right that happens um we we
(6:15:02) don't Salvage their reputation cuz they're also priest instead they get still get burdened with the reputation
(6:15:08) in fact even more so because they're a priest and yet for some reason when it comes to prostitutes with thousands of
(6:15:14) men in the body count who suddenly are part of women's Liberation Christianity suddenly they say well wait
(6:15:21) a second you can't judge what I've done in this and that or nor my authority
(6:15:27) towards any biblical anything because I've bought a new rep reputation with my
(6:15:32) religion that is a modern phenomenon we'll get right back into it
(6:15:38) I need to let a couple chats come through your spicy ween than spicy we9 donated thank man it's nice seeing a
(6:15:45) panel void of trolls show my German Shepherds agree and now have to pee it's
(6:15:51) been real yo thank you man appreciate it thank you spicy guys W's in the chat for
(6:15:58) spicy ween 89 and German Shepherds are the best breed there you go mhm didn't
(6:16:05) would have a German shepher he's the goodest boy a yo OJ thank you OJ Simpson
(6:16:11) donated $200 thank you juice sketchy LIF Tyler freaking me the F out Katarina
(6:16:17) you're not gangster Candice sweet Candice you're looking as beautiful as ever honestly pretty bright too you're
(6:16:25) still as tight as I left you Fu chill out so aggressive OJ holy [ __ ]
(6:16:35) oh my goodness it's just a c and a y have you ever like worked with
(6:16:41) somebody and then they're you're you there's like something like in their eyes that just clicks and and you're
(6:16:48) like this [ __ ] masturb like have has that happened you're like this guy watched my stuff you know like in my
(6:16:54) personal life like personal or on a scene like personal no no like personal life or even like in business or
(6:17:00) something and then they kind of like do a double take and they're like wait oh you know yeah every guy I've been with
(6:17:06) has watch has seen it before wait every guy you've been like has you've dated or that I've dated or slept with well not
(6:17:12) dated because my first boyfriend was before I got into the industry yeah and then the second one I ended up marrying
(6:17:18) but like um guys that were like either part of like the open or like whatever
(6:17:24) yeah okay they've all seen uh I guess you have you had another thing here on body count but I mean you went to
(6:17:30) college right mhm I don't know you you saw some I went to mytle beach okay so it was a party University so I mean
(6:17:39) girls would probably get five over the weekend you know so that's when I see that number I'm like you aren't being
(6:17:44) the sorority girls are you kidding me well the crazy thing is the sorority girls tell the Frack guys that they're
(6:17:50) virgins but they're not no other [ __ ] like that yeah so I think that's probably what's happening with a lot of
(6:17:55) those polls a lot of I do think people even if even I think with Anonymous polls I think people like still don't
(6:18:02) want to tell the truth even then want admit it mhm yeah but um body count you
(6:18:08) said uh what are what are you trying to gain from that question you don't think it's a whole lot um I think you can get good amount
(6:18:16) of info from the body I think superficially sure but I think that there are more important questions to
() 
(6:18:22) ask if you're trying to date someone or if you're trying to figure out if that's a good match or not so again there there
(6:18:27) can and coming from the industry I was in there for plenty of years I've seen women that go in and they treat it like
(6:18:34) a business and they're making decisions like in alignment with whatever their values are or goals are and then I've
(6:18:40) seen train wrecks go in and they're like very much there because of like a survival reason right so I'm more
(6:18:47) curious as to like why you're doing that action and to like dive deeper into the behavior instead of just looking at the
(6:18:52) behavior and saying that that is um that's indicative of like this personality trade across the board and
(6:18:58) it might be true like there might be certain truths that are um that are linked to that absolutely I'm not
(6:19:03) denying that but I'm just saying if you're going to investigate someone as a partner or a life partner there's deeper questions that you have to be asking I
(6:19:09) agree like are they in therapy what psychoactive medications do
(6:19:15) they take well that yeah those that those are important absolutely I've had people um not romantic relationships but
(6:19:21) like employees lie about like mental health stuff or like they're not on medications and I mean I know that Hippa
(6:19:27) and all of that but that's important information to know sure you did also indicate I think this is the last thing
(6:19:33) on body count um you said there was no correlation to faithfulness INF Fidelity
(6:19:38) when it came to body count yes uh I mean I did want to challenge you a little bit on this there's a bunch of at least from
(6:19:44) what I've seen there's a bunch of studies that seem to indicate that it is there is a correlation the sample size
(6:19:49) with those is really off and then I don't know what a Delta was I was giving it to someone who's much smarter than me that can actually read stats and I sent
(6:19:56) it to him and I was like um can you like tell me cuz this goes against the argument or the conversation that we
(6:20:02) were having the other day and he said it um there's really high Delta and I don't know what that means in that uh like a
(6:20:08) span like a standard deviation well there was an issue with the delta in those research papers the Gap I don't
(6:20:15) know I'm not a statistician or a researcher or a journalist as we established earlier in the podcast so
(6:20:22) any any update by the way any wait wait hang on here I'm sorry I can't let this
(6:20:28) go how can you take issue with the stats if you don't know what your issue with the stats is no I'm saying the first the
(6:20:35) sample size was my issue is that it was like a really small sample size sample size well if it's super small then you can't apply it to the masses right well
(6:20:42) it depends on what we're trying to study and control are for the sample size if you take 20 people you can't say well
(6:20:49) these 20 people did this one thing so then that's um indicative of anyone that commits that behavior depends on what
(6:20:55) we're trying to study I just don't think 20 is accurate you could take you could take 20 as a sample size and have it be
() 
(6:21:01) representative of something but in this case are you saying the sample size hang on in this case why are you saying the
(6:21:06) sample size was plenty no I don't know I remember it being small I think it went yeah but what does that mean though so
(6:21:14) this is the problem right when you when you get into the details the det like the the gal who's next to you she's
(6:21:20) actually going to literally agree with everything I just said she she has no choice is hang on hang on this is stats
(6:21:26) this is how they work right you can't have sample size which are small but are they do have some kind of
(6:21:35) stat you know statistical relevance or significance in this case you just saying well the sample size from my view
(6:21:41) was small doesn't actually mean anything it means something it doesn't mean nothing you could well maybe but maybe
(6:21:48) not it it indicates the level of confidence we can draw from the yeah but what is okay well then what is small
(6:21:54) tell me what small is as number the stud well you can you can do a calculation on the level of confidence tell me what
(6:22:00) small is she says it's small but won I would say for me anything under a th000 I would consider a small sample size
(6:22:05) like if I were to pull one person at this table and say um are you saying that hold hold on let her let her finish
(6:22:12) go ahead well I just want to know that well I mean the the rules aren't being applied evenly so it's like I can't
(6:22:18) interject at all but then I keep getting interrupted definitely interject no cuz that you're like no no let me finish let
(6:22:23) me finish but then it's different rules for me and then that's not fair I did just apprciate that thank you yeah
(6:22:29) because it's lightning the reason that I interject very quickly is just for quick clarification but when I do it it's not
(6:22:35) allowed for quick clarification it is allowed I'm happy and that it's one of my critiques about the show right it's
(6:22:40) just like there I'm all for debate and like having ideas proven wrong but there's a way to do it that's like out
(6:22:46) of curiosity and in good faith and doing it in respect and then there's like a way that you can do it with tone and
(6:22:51) intent that is like it's bad okay well there's there's literally eight people on the panel I've spoken very little I'm
(6:22:57) having a lightning round with you I'm getting clarification as quickly you popped in I didn't even know this was a debate I thought we were just like going
(6:23:02) over topics and then like you popped in and we are going over topics yes if you're saying that there's not a
(6:23:09) too small for a sample size do you think that I can go ask one person a question okay so what would what would not be
(6:23:15) like what would be an appropriate size for you then so like when it's going depend on what it is that we're studying why and what the control factors are so
(6:23:21) this is my whole problem I'm saying controls but like I'm not sure that you understand how controls work controls are super important for any study yes
(6:23:29) like like controls are important for certain types of things that you're studying you can't just throw out
(6:23:36) no there's no science is not possible I understand how to run studies you don't
(6:23:42) need controls for all things that you studies are all [ __ ] you haven't read my studies dude listen yes I have
(6:23:49) dove into your studies which is how I knew that teenagers were over sampled in all of them and they're all [ __ ]
(6:23:55) that aside that aside can you tell me how you can have science absent controls Madame you you can absolutely have
(6:24:02) science absent controls like example for example science is testing a hypothesis
(6:24:07) right and like let's say I have a hypothesis here that like maybe the people who looked worse when they were
(6:24:12) made into old people actually have higher body counts um how would you propose we have a control for this this
(6:24:18) hypothesis well wait a second let's back up your hypothesis is what that the
(6:24:24) people who looked worse when they were aged up have higher body counts this is my hypothesis hypothetically yeah great
(6:24:30) so you're going to test this hypothesis so what what would you suggest be wait are we testing the hypothesis cuz that's
(6:24:36) the next part of the scientific method right yeah we could we could test it by okay so how can you have a test ABS in a
(6:24:42) control I I would I'm proposing the hypothesis I'd like to know how you would propose that we control for it
(6:24:47) doesn't matter how I would do it I'm asking how it could even be done ABS in a control the way that I would test this
(6:24:53) hypothesis is I would ask people to like for example I would figure out how bad we look in the things maybe assign a
(6:24:58) rating so we can have a number control uh no that's not a control okay do we just have like very different meanings
(6:25:05) of the word what do you mean when you say we don't have very different meanings of the word control assigning a number to a way of face is not a control
(6:25:11) in science what do you think a control is a control is let's say I give a medication to type a group of people because I want to see if it has an
(6:25:17) effect I also measure the group of people that have not received that medication as a control to see if
(6:25:23) there's a difference between the populations so in sociology you're saying there's no controls I'm saying there can be controls I'm saying I'm
(6:25:29) giving you what is to me listen to me talk for a second what I saying what I'm
(6:25:35) saying is that there are some types of hypothesis for which testing does not require controls and I'm giving you a
(6:25:41) very narrow example for example I'm checking to see if there's a correlation in this group between the apparent age
(6:25:49) of being aged up and a body count and I would do this by looking at the number assigned to the age and I would look at
(6:25:54) the body count and I would run a correlation what you've done is you've created a control ruling other things
(6:25:59) out that's not what a control is a control is CA taking another group
(6:26:04) and then checking to see if your intervention had an effect depending on the group that's one type of control the
(6:26:10) other thing you talked about is another type of control we are measuring two variables all scientific all yeah all
(6:26:16) scientific are you using the word stop stop all the scientific control is doing is controlling for a variable the very
(6:26:22) first thing that you gave me was a variable control you [ __ ] dummy so
(6:26:28) you were saying you're using the word how do you not know this [ __ ] you're a [ __ ] yes the very first thing you gave me was a [ __ ] variable control
(6:26:35) the very first thing you said was a variable control so what you're saying is that if we are testing the
(6:26:41) correlation between uh two do a colle sorry everything's happening suddenly so embarrassing for you I can't
(6:26:48) even believe that you just said that but go ahead only effective did it though like how are you feeling right now do
() 
(6:26:54) you feel like you're like having a fun time dominating oh my God because I really think that maybe you don't know
(6:27:00) how science Works how does my mental state help you explain what [ __ ] scientific control is when the first
(6:27:06) thing you said was a scientific control ruling out X thing that's a control a
(6:27:11) control is when you H when you make sure that you're testing a group to make sure that it's not being affected by your
(6:27:16) intervention it's a control form of control okay and or you can test two
(6:27:21) variables to see if there's a correlation and are you saying that the very first control that you gave us I have never in my life heard the word
(6:27:29) control used to refer to one of the variables which would I could be wrong I am willing to say I was wrong if it
(6:27:34) turns out that standard science if you're setting parameters for an experiment everything that you're setting which would rule X variable out
(6:27:41) would be a control ruling what okay what do you mean everything that I'm saying would rule X variable out like what am I
(6:27:48) saying would rule X variable out okay so if we want a control for this like okay
(6:27:55) my hypothesis is that there's Flint which makes this flame happen right so I
(6:28:00) can add a variance I can add uh a 100 different variant of controls to this can't I I can take the Flint out for
(6:28:08) instance or uh possibly I can add multiple flints or I could say well
(6:28:13) we're not going to do that at all we're only going to do X all of those things would be controls and the experiment for
(6:28:19) how this Flint made this lighter work you're talking about statistics when it comes to uh studies the very first thing
(6:28:25) you say is the way that I would do this is I would divide X by y you're introducing a control which rules other
(6:28:31) things out you're trying to narrow the process to affirm the hyp hang on you're trying to narrow the process to affirm
(6:28:37) the hypothesis that's what you're doing yeah I understand attempting to rule things that's a control you can't even
(6:28:42) do experiments without controls that's my whole point uh I I think you're coming from an
(6:28:49) extremely different type of science than I am or else you don't understand how the science that I'm doing works I'm not
(6:28:54) sure which one is the case I can't wait to hear this tell me how we can have science absent a control for an
(6:29:03) experiment all experiments experiment by itself is literally inferring that
(6:29:08) there's controls or we couldn't have an experiment okay let's let's think of a slightly simpler example um let's say I
(6:29:16) want to see if there's a correlation between height and weight in a population um how would you propose that
() 
(6:29:21) we test this uh between height and weight I don't know you tell me uh well
(6:29:27) I told you my strategy for the last one can you tell me your strategy for this one why would it matter what my strategy
(6:29:32) is uh just so that I know how you're thinking about this I don't know I mean I I have no idea how I I know that it is
(6:29:39) like uh you like to put me on the defensive by asking a lot of questions and then you won't answer questions
(6:29:44) because that would put you on the defensive I don't know how I would conduct such a study why would that matter uh well just think do we have a
(6:29:53) whole bunch of people and we're trying to see like literally what would the relevancy be regardless of how I
(6:29:59) answered right to whether or not it would have the addition of control
(6:30:04) I I'm just curious how you would test to see if there's a correlation between height and weight just how would you do the science what's your strategy I have
(6:30:09) no I have no idea I have never thought about it yeah okay well there are ways to do this uh there's there's there's
(6:30:16) statistical things we can run like we make a chart X and Y AIS it's the chart if you would like to call one of the
(6:30:22) axes a control we can put that word on that if that makes you happy what else would it be the x axis it's it's it's
(6:30:28) the X and Y axis it's like you plot the data on a graph this is just the way that it works um why are we doing that
(6:30:34) though uh we're controlling for what cuz we're controlling for what we're not controlling for anything we're testing
(6:30:40) to see if there's a correlation do you know what correl for so we're controlling for a correl we're
(6:30:46) not we're no that we're we're running a calculation on the do you know what a correlation is yes okay do can you can
(6:30:54) you tell me what just to make sure that you understand what a correlate is what a correlation is like how is a
(6:30:59) correlation calculated would be something that could be Loosely or vaguely or non vaguely associated with
(6:31:05) some other property uh very close yes it's it's uh it helps tell you how much
(6:31:10) you can predict one variable by knowledge of the other variable so for example if we want to check the correlation between height and weight I
(6:31:17) don't care about a monologue I'm asking how it's not a control your question makes no sense I can explain to you how correlations work
(6:31:23) I can explain to you Val about how correlations work I'm asking about controls not correlation the cor
(6:31:29) controls are are relevant for certain types of questions I'm perhaps they are
(6:31:34) I'm trying to say controls are not controls right now and if you say okay I have a graph and it divides it in half
(6:31:42) and it's putting this half over here this half over there you have now introduced a way to control what your
(6:31:48) experiment is going to be I can I can continue so if we have a graph x and y axis like this and then we plot
(6:31:55) everybody's height and weight along it so like one axis is height and the other axis is weight and you have a whole bunch of dots on this graph what you can
(6:32:01) do is you can run like basically do a calculation that shows you a trend line to see if like the dots slowly kind of
(6:32:07) increase uh with the y- axis the more you get the higher you get on the x-axis and then you do a calculation of the
(6:32:12) square root of the uh all of the points from the trend line um and then basically from that you get What's
(6:32:18) called the the r the R value uh and this is how uh like far away different points
(6:32:24) are from being tightly correlated so for example that may actually that makes total sense to me yeah so for example height and I'm just going to read I just
(6:32:30) want to read a simple thing for you experimental control refers to a group or element within the scientific
(6:32:36) experiment that remains unchanged or seres as a baseline comparison or divider from the experimental group
(6:32:42) everything you just explained was a control no I explained you a correlation I I no no no no you explained how to you
(6:32:49) control yes you so you want something that's unchanged from the group yes so for example if I'm giving you
(6:32:56) medication uh then this means that I am introducing some sort of influence and so I have a control to check the
(6:33:02) difference between those groups uh that's what a control is and I think this is great and fantastic and very important in science that a lot of
(6:33:08) science doesn't have controls and I think you are correct to be going why are they not am correct that you're
(6:33:13) right this different concept science is only as good as it controls and you
(6:33:18) haven't actually given me a way in which we can conduct an experiment absent
(6:33:24) controls uh well I'm describing how we can find the correlation between height and weight yeah I'm not I'm not asking
(6:33:31) about how you can describe correl guys asking how can we run an
(6:33:36) experiment which we refers to a group or element within a scientific experiment
(6:33:42) that remains either unchanged serves as a baseline for comparison or divides the experimental group how could you even do
(6:33:50) it how that's a great question how would you do it if we're trying to test he I'm asking you we don't because you could just
(6:33:58) choose an age can we move on right move everybody's the same age there's your I mean I'm you guys can
(6:34:05) like wrap it up but if this is going to go on another 20 minutes I have to cut it here so you guys can if you can like
(6:34:11) wrap it up quickly we can like continue a little bit because yeah so I'll just wrap it up quick my what I said was
(6:34:18) science is only as good as its controls right she ends up agreeing with me yes you're right actually this is very
(6:34:24) important to the scientific process it really experiments are really only as good as their controls she says though
(6:34:29) you can have experiments absent controls but actually didn't give us any experiments absent controls just
(6:34:36) literally gave us experiments where she starts with Baseline of having controls for for her experiments that was my
(6:34:41) whole point the thing is I don't I don't I'm not sure how you can even conduct an experiment absent controls I think every
(6:34:48) I think it's even inferred in experiment that you are controlling XYZ based on
(6:34:54) what this definition is for the thing that's my whole point but back to this back to what we're originally talking
(6:34:59) about you just saying sample size X really small doesn't actually mean
(6:35:05) anything small is a not a scientific reference it's a reference to like a
(6:35:12) mind state of of you know like is this cell phone small is this cigarette small
(6:35:17) I have no [ __ ] idea what small means here because it's not a scientific reference a scientific reference would
(6:35:23) be anything under X would not be appropriate due to you know [ __ ] XYZ
(6:35:28) whatever right small doesn't mean anything is there um like a preferred amount of of people for a survey though
(6:35:36) or for research that scientists like is there like a golden number that people try to get to or at least a minimum
(6:35:42) depends on what we're talking about no in general I'm sure that something would apply to across the board like a goal
(6:35:47) maybe they don't hit it every time but is there typically like a golden number I'm not I'm not say
(6:35:53) to this is what I aim for for minimum for but but on what though 3 to 400 for
(6:35:59) what we're trying we're trying to establish what small means so I'm saying that I'm sure that there probably is a
(6:36:06) minimum that scientists would like to get in order to be it depends on what it
(6:36:11) is that we're studying and what it is what it depends on what it is
(6:36:16) specifically like this listen I know that how this sounds but it actually does matter depends on what we're
(6:36:22) studying for what a sample size would be appropriate to what group like for instance uh uh one or two 200 people may
(6:36:29) be fine for like transgender people because there's so few of them there's so you that could be a good
(6:36:35) representation of a sample size not saying it is by the way chair one I can see you already autistically gping I
(6:36:41) said it could be I'm just giving you the the idea that some groups may have very
(6:36:46) narrow windows and so smaller sample sizes could be fine so it depends on what we're studying and
(6:36:52) why I agree with you but not for the reasons you stated okay you're just so here's the
(6:36:59) thing I'm going to I'm going to go ahead and just say give me the reasons the literally going to be the reasons I just
(6:37:05) stated though go ahead uh so just to make sure I understood you right you're claiming that the reasons that a small
(6:37:11) sample size can be fine is like possibly you're measuring a very small population so no sorry you said okay can you
(6:37:17) clarify an incorrect Steel Man the ski man would be small sub please correct me so when you say small it's a subject
(6:37:23) that's a subjective metric it's not telling me anything that doesn't tell me any
(6:37:29) information like like for the prostitutes what's a small dick I don't know that's going to be completely
(6:37:35) subjective as to what you think that is I have no idea what that means it's not
(6:37:40) scientifically small is not scientific it's some madeup [ __ ] in your head to
(6:37:45) give a reference to something which is not as big as another thing but it doesn't tell me anything so when I say
(6:37:52) small I'm trying to reference her or give a reference to her worldview this is too small of a sample size this is
(6:37:58) too large for a sample size but you're not actually telling me anything well I'll say how I agree with you and I
(6:38:03) agree with you uh Michael Jones donated $200 a scientific control is a part of
(6:38:11) the scientific method that involves using a standard for comparison to minimize the effect of variables other
(6:38:16) than the independent variable Jesus is Lord totally agree I don't know how an
(6:38:22) experiment can be done which is part of the scientific method absent of control she said she did never could give us
(6:38:28) one so glad we got to the bottom of that [ __ ] hell
(6:38:35) I keep talking about statistics all night well look I mean I propos I did propose earlier uh if you wanted to do a
(6:38:41) One V one conversation absolutely not all right this is your chance Andrew
(6:38:47) keep going no oh boy I don't understand did you say
(6:38:52) nar N I said no n n n no she's she's
(6:38:59) British it's yeah mine's actually the English language know trying to lighten trying to light the mood okay Andrew you
(6:39:06) guys is there more to statistics I'll keep anyway so so look I'll I'll I'll
(6:39:12) just tie it off here very quickly right I understand you don't want to do a debate on this stuff I don't blame you
(6:39:17) right um because that would go bad for you but the point is is like you really
(6:39:23) haven't actually demonstrated how you can run an experiment as like I do want
(6:39:28) to actually know if that's even possible to do because to me it infers controls just experiment itself the word in first
(6:39:35) control it's definitely a huge subset of science involves that yeah so can you
(6:39:41) give me experiment that doesn't have control so we have a question of whether or not height correlates with weight
(6:39:48) this is a hypothesis that we should test uh I can explain to you how correlations work yeah but how does the
(6:39:54) experiment work no this was uh the experiment is we're going to ask a whole bunch of people their height and
(6:40:00) weight okay and then we're going to to see if there is a relationship between those things are we going to ask people
(6:40:06) about what color their dog's fur is if we could I don't see it would be relevant are we going to ask him what
(6:40:12) color their dog's fur is probably not oh sounds like a control
(6:40:18) then anything anyway I appreciate that very much that was very kind of you to go ahead and demonstrate my point for me
(6:40:24) I hadn't really like directly experienced in person people being like extremely overconfident about statistics
(6:40:29) um but here we are this has nothing to even do with statistics it really does about controls for a scientific
(6:40:36) experiment what you have done is you have now narrowed that you in indeed in your experiment are going to immediately
(6:40:43) add controls to it just by ruling out the things you won't ask you're now adding in by the way the definition yes
(6:40:51) right an unchanging this is an unchanging we can control element within
(6:40:57) the scientific experiment that remains unchanged that uh that serves as a baseline for comparison you immediately
(6:41:04) are are introducing something which is an unchanged element right because you're not asking about dogs fur you're
(6:41:10) asking about the height and weight that is a control we we can control for things for example if I ask about height
(6:41:15) and weight maybe we should control for gender like maybe uh men you could you
(6:41:21) could add that right and that would be a control it could be relevant add but you're not going to add what
(6:41:27) color their dogs fur is right uh we could try and control fur dogs fur uh I
(6:41:32) don't think that would change anything well but you already are controlling for dog fur because you're not asking about
(6:41:38) dog fur because you have an unchanging standard
(6:41:45) it's a control look um you got if you guys want to have the 1 V one you can I
(6:41:51) let this go on for like 15 minutes um this podcast doesn't exist in vacuum
(6:41:56) there's other guests I have to be considerate no problem I'm happy to move on um so uh I it's a frequent criticism
(6:42:04) I get like that I move things on but like a lot of people aren't in the room like there's other people that want to
(6:42:11) talk I have to be considerate of like other guests on the podcast it's totally
(6:42:16) Reas zero I have zero issues with this yeah no I'm not I'm not directing this at you Andrew it's just like a lot of
(6:42:22) the commenters get uh and I'll even Grant sometimes I do cut conversation
(6:42:28) short um but sometimes we do have to move it on and look if you got I'll
(6:42:35) happily host the 1 V one I'll be I can moderate
(6:42:40) it I'll scold him if he calls you a Spur how dare you Andrew how dare I sent him
(6:42:46) a text never mind well I am probably a spurg oh okay all right me too we have
(6:42:52) something in common that's cool um all right here let me get through everything here um there's only a few more notes
(6:42:57) we'll do the row session then we got WRA all right uh so Candice
(6:43:03) you oh the viral clip we have to do the viral clip we have a couple tweets to react to and then that's it um you did
(6:43:09) say that you think the entry of age for porn should be raised to 25 uh that seems like a decent Baseline you said
(6:43:15) modern dating has ruined men and women women want six feet no six six figure
() 
(6:43:21) six feet six inches okay and men are getting blackpilled and quitting the game altogether uh you had a viral clip
(6:43:27) on Twitter about all day foreplay um I don't know if we need to pull up the
(6:43:34) clip you can probably just restate the position uh do you want to like explain that I guess yeah I was actually really
(6:43:39) surprised that um it had the response that it did because I didn't think I said anything controversial at all and I
(6:43:44) actually sent it to a couple counselors I know and they're like no this is really marriage 101 but it's the idea
(6:43:50) that um men and wom women are different our arousal is different and then our
(6:43:55) our breaks and what um leads to pleasure is different and every man if they're
(6:44:01) being honest has been with a woman and it's going great and then the garbage truck pulls up or like something will
(6:44:08) happen and she can get into her head out of the moment you have to start all over again you're like what is happening so the clip was saying that we as women
(6:44:16) tend to see um everything as a threat when we're over stimulated over stressed
(6:44:22) and ways to help mitigate that would be especially as the man if you're going to be the leaders to have follow-through so
(6:44:28) if you say I'm going to take out the trash take out the trash pick up your own um socks right like all of the these little things add up as stressors and
(6:44:34) are hitting the breaks of her arousal and um it was I think the thing that got
(6:44:40) people mad was equating trash to like a tiger but most like psychologists or
(6:44:46) neuroscientists will say it's absolutely the same effect if you're getting chased by a tiger or if you're experienc chronic or if you're experiencing stress
(6:44:53) chronic or acute it's very very similar um so how can you help your woman
(6:44:58) achieve more pleasure it's just like follow through because if you're not following through if you make these promises is that you're going to help
(6:45:03) contribute help out around the house um help with the kids whatever it is and you don't do that that's now seen as
(6:45:09) unreliable and then in her subconscious I'm not even saying it's active she's like oh is he going to be a good leader
(6:45:15) is he going to be able to protect is he going to be able to provide because if you're not doing these things that you say you are and I think that that's um
(6:45:21) that is like the sign of being a healthy mature masculine right is being a man of your word if you're not doing those
(6:45:27) things she and her body are saying unreliable and shutting down and that was it it wasn't like a dunk on it's not
(6:45:33) saying women should have the right to nag and like people were saying that too I don't think women should nag or emasculate like there was a lot of uh
(6:45:39) straw man arguments being brought into the clips and then I fell into the Trap of trying to defend it I'm like just
(6:45:44) watch what I said cuz I didn't say half of the stuff that everyone's accusing me of okay mhm
(6:45:54) um so so so like how does that look like though from the guys like what's the guy
(6:45:59) going to do it's going to be different in every relationship so there's kind of and this is going to be really like rudimentary
(6:46:05) but um in a lot of the relationship books that I've been reading recently and this is um it's going to be
(6:46:11) dependent on what school of thought you go to there's like three different stages of relationships that people tend to fall in one is going to be more
(6:46:17) traditional and you have like very strict um assigned roles and this will be like the man is the provider he does
(6:46:24) everything out of the house the woman is more domestic everything inside is her domain and no one should really expect
(6:46:30) the other one to pick up the other one slack like real clear division the other one is more feminist and that's where you get into like partnership 50/50 um
(6:46:38) unclear boundaries and unclear um leadership unclear assignment of tasks
(6:46:44) and that's where you get into a lot of trouble especially when it comes to intimacy and sexual relationships wait so is it like the guy kind of like
(6:46:50) helping take care of the house and stuff and um trash well no cuz that can
(6:46:55) actually go into the third one too so the first one like the man's not expected to do that right like clear defined roles he's not touching the
(6:47:00) trash that's her her job unless it's like or something right and I'm sure every man would conceded that the second
(6:47:06) one is like there it's like this weird place that no one wants to establish dominance because they automatically
(6:47:12) think that that's bad so no one is the leader no one is in charge it's a perfect 50-50 relationship and that's where like most like modern feminist
(6:47:19) relationships are right now so even though um let's say both partners are working and this is where it gets more
(6:47:25) complicated cuz the comment section was acting like uh the W the wife was automatically stay at home well that's
(6:47:30) not true for the majority of women so typically both people are working but then when the mom gets home she also has
(6:47:36) most of the tasks when it comes to like domestic chores the kids cooking Etc so now she's getting mad at husband because
(6:47:44) she feels over stimulated overworked overstressed and then she takes that out by nagging emasculating and that comes
(6:47:50) down to a fault of not having clear defined roles but again it's like it's the issue of the 50/50 the third one is
(6:47:56) what you would call Intimate communion and that is um there's still clear leadership in that but it's more of
(6:48:03) like my needs are your needs in a way like I'm happy to make you happy right
(6:48:08) and most men especially if like you're Mar and this again was like for married couples I'm not expecting some Chad from
(6:48:15) the bar to go take out the trash like this conversation for like long-term married couples if you're married you
(6:48:21) want to do things that make your wife happy she wants to make you happy that's a healthy relationship but if you see her needs as um like a chore that was
(6:48:29) another thing people were saying is chore play or if she's talking down to him like that's not healthy that's not
(6:48:34) intimate communion so it's like more of a merging as like the last most elevated stage but still clear defined um roles
(6:48:41) and responsibilities can you help me out with something here sure because the the
(6:48:47) counter Clan here uh which seems quite which seems quite relevant is that as
(6:48:53) soon as Men start doing all of the chores and they start um participating in this and this kind of thing that
(6:48:59) women get very upset with them that they seem to be less attractive to them and that when women are asked about
(6:49:05) attraction levels towards men who act in the capacity as a breadwinner in the not doing the chores portion uh they seem to
(6:49:11) be have a higher attraction rate towards those men why would that be well I never said all I'm not asking about all I'm
(6:49:19) just asking about you said if a man if he's doing half so so seemingly uh women
(6:49:26) uh often are sleeping with the type of men that you're talking about and opining about their traditional lack of
(6:49:33) traditional uh marriage or lack of traditional men or lack of masculine men but masculinity in this Society of
(6:49:39) course is appropriated by non-feminine Behavior some of which is going to include housework and uh busy work like
(6:49:46) this yeah I don't know that houseworks necessarily um entirely feminine I would
(6:49:52) argue that like something like keeping the fire lit is more of the man's job that is housework I would say I would I
(6:49:58) would say trash is mostly um a man's work as well just because of weight hm
(6:50:03) have you ever heard of he death he death no yeah so it used to actually be a
(6:50:09) common phenomenon back when people had to use fire for heating instead of natural gas things like this women would
(6:50:16) become emulated because they wore garments which would catch on fire and so their he would kill them this was not
(6:50:23) a phenomenon which was associated with men it was associated with women maybe men were better atending women were the
(6:50:30) ones who kept the he going mhm because they did the cooking on what the hear
(6:50:36) they did all of the preparation for meals on the he they did the literally this is feminine and it's always
(6:50:43) traditionally been feminine that women actually are the ones who keep the fires
(6:50:48) going uh and this type of thing which is why we have the phenomenon of you know H
() 
(6:50:53) death but you don't think that we can redefine um like rules i' I've not not
(6:50:58) entirely but specifically with fire like men and especially if you have boys or little boys they love fire like there's
(6:51:05) they go through a phase where they love nothing more than fire and I do think that fire in general is like more of
(6:51:10) like a masculine Essence so I wouldn't say like seeing a guy light a fire and be like oh he's a [ __ ] like no it's
(6:51:17) actually really sexul masculine because it's it's like powerful it's deadly right it's
(6:51:23) something that is supposed to be like yeah but but look at this so we're not talking about
(6:51:30) fire a who loads who puts the logs in and keeps the fire burning in the he
(6:51:37) well that's going to be associative with cooking and who's Associated well not anymore it's not so that's what I'm
(6:51:42) saying like maybe that's redefined cuz I know a lot and then grills now grilling is entirely the man's domain and that's
(6:51:49) the more direct flame usually yeah but when you're talking about traditional Norms that people are
(6:51:56) adhering to meaning the attractiveness of a traditional man seems to be higher than the attractiveness of a modern man
(6:52:03) that's the case we're talking about tradition we're not talking about the subjective interpretation of gender
(6:52:09) Norms changing over time otherwise we would be destroying what traditional means so the idea here that men going
(6:52:17) and doing the [ __ ] laundry uh you know and uh sweeping the floor and doing
(6:52:22) all these things because by your own metric you're actually at the mercy of your own metric in another way which is
(6:52:27) that who the [ __ ] is going around the uh the fireplace now for heat almost no
(6:52:33) it's not for the purpose of he it's the aesthetic yeah so even if that's the case even if that's the case here that
(6:52:39) now this is masculine that you stoke the fire almost nobody's sitting around their hearth for warmth anymore that's
(6:52:44) not the way it works anymore we have natural gas and propane and electricity the argument was that it's just not
(6:52:50) feminine I don't think that lighting a fire is inherently feminine I don't think any single woman is going to see a
(6:52:55) man light a fire and be like he is a [ __ ] I no longer want to have sex with him and zero zero women sure it could be
(6:53:01) neutral but Michael Jones donated $200 there are only three reasons to
(6:53:07) debate one the outcome of the debate directly affects people's lives two you
(6:53:14) think you can change the mind of your opponent three there's an audience Jesus
(6:53:20) is Lord Michael Jones than kind of agree with a lot of that but yeah so the the
(6:53:25) point here is like whether or not even if I were just to kind of grant that that fire itself is more masculine
(6:53:32) that's not a [ __ ] chore like when when people are referencing chores or not referencing oh my God I have to load
(6:53:38) the fireplace and light it in mity like it has nothing to do with anything we're talking about laundry washing socks
(6:53:44) sweeping the floors vacuuming uh scrubbing dishes [ __ ] like that we're not talking about uh putting logs in a
(6:53:51) fire and lighting them I was talking about taking things off of her plate to help reduce her stress or or over
(6:53:57) stimulus and if both people are working how do you how do you assign roles within the house because most women are
(6:54:03) working a this is great so we came to this question earlier when I was saying that you have a feminist stake so now we
(6:54:10) come full circle which is great so the I gave this same hypothetical back which
(6:54:15) is who ultimately is going to be in the position of authority so if you have a
(6:54:20) deal breaker threshold breaker something like this who ends up in Authority you you said well it's equal right so
(6:54:26) there's going to be sometimes a man has Authority sometimes a woman has Authority depending on what their tasks are that they do when it comes to
(6:54:33) choring though right most men they they seem to be fine with women doing the choring right and the thing is is like
(6:54:41) you could say well most women aren't fine with doing the choring the problem is is that why do they find it so
(6:54:47) attractive when men won't do the [ __ ] choring so your idea here that well uh
(6:54:53) in this is your summary of your argument that I wrote down women are into men who do chores so that they are less stressed
(6:55:00) but I can't actually find anything to back this up at all in fact I I find data that is contrary that they're
(6:55:07) looking for masculine men who provide and don't do any chores so it has nothing to do with mate selection that
(6:55:13) wasn't the conversation at all it's once you're already in an established relationship and then those Dynamics and
(6:55:19) what is required for a woman to have arousal or pleasure is going to be completely different than in the beginning of a relationship you build up
(6:55:24) resentment contentment there's stress the relationship is entirely different my point of it wasn't to to like have
(6:55:31) your guy do chores it's having him want to unburden her with things that are stressing her out it's to help
(6:55:37) contribute and it's if you say something to do something it was like go do all of these chores and be like my little pet
(6:55:43) it's like if you said you were going to do something the follow through is the thing that's important the follow through or the lack thereof is the thing
(6:55:49) that is creating the issue between her and her ability to have arousal or intimacy with you so was it necessar
(6:55:55) attracted to men who don't do any of this [ __ ] who follow through no who follow with them but if the with them
(6:56:03) then they expect to change in Behavior to do chores no to follow through the
(6:56:08) chores was one example so it doesn't have to be taking out the trash or doing the dishes or any of that especially if
(6:56:13) that's not what's agreed upon in the relationship it's doing what you said you're going to do like one example in a lot of relationship books it's like this
() 
(6:56:20) guy comes home and um he just like made a killing like he just got a huge promotion or just like made a u like
(6:56:27) made a massive deal and he goes to his wife and he's like I just landed this deal and he's so excited and the very
(6:56:32) first thing that she says is will you forgot the milk right cuz like and that has probably happened to so many men
(6:56:38) it's like an immediate nag how do I take away his win and bring him down a level that's an overstressed woman and what
(6:56:45) I'm seeing in that it's not necessarily true is a pattern of behavior pattern of um of lack of follow-through so it's
(6:56:51) like she doesn't care what you just did that you see as a success and she would if you were actually being a man of we
(6:56:57) word and following through with all of these things it's she she's pointing out how she sees you as safe or unreliable
(6:57:03) because she doesn't see you doing the things that you're going to say even if it's as Tiny as getting the milk so it has nothing to do with chores it's more
(6:57:09) of just like this has to be final word it has to be final word I well I actually understand the position really
(6:57:15) well I'll just steal man it very quickly because it's about follow through right this this has nothing to do chores were
(6:57:21) an example that you were making and only an example which comes to the follow through and the reason that kind of the
(6:57:27) breakdown happens is specifically because they're not seeing the type of follow through that they would want
(6:57:33) yeah okay but don't you understand that there's an inference here that's kind of funny when you think about it this would
(6:57:39) mean that if men said I'm not ever going to do any [ __ ] chores ever and I'm
(6:57:44) going to uh B essentially not do X Y and Z that if they compromised on that for
(6:57:50) the relationship they would be showing a lack of follow through like so basically
(6:57:55) if they set the parameters I'm going to remain in a gigachad for the rest of my life and not do [ __ ] and [ __ ] you're
(6:58:01) going to [ __ ] clean the house and do the dishes and that's the thing they're attracted to that if men never backed
(6:58:07) off on that that would actually show that they have follow through no one no one's dating that guy yeah but that has
(6:58:13) nothing to do with the point right no no and I think that that's not that's not necessarily a fair analogy either
(6:58:19) because you can always Elevate grow or like do something out of love like right and that was part of the clip too is little touch points of love and showing
(6:58:25) that I care throughout the day so it's like if I see that you need the slack picked up I'm going to be here to support you so again it's not it's not
(6:58:32) chores it's how are you showing up to support the person that you decided to like build a life with well these well these are two different arguments so the
(6:58:39) first one is it shows a lack of follow through and this builds resentment and then the second one is well wait a
(6:58:44) second no it's really about the uh conduciveness to the differing needs that the various individual have that
(6:58:50) change hang on that change over time but here's the thing if one person's needs change over time right and the one man
(6:58:57) hasn't compromised or done anything he is actually showing follow through right no and your needs absolutely change over
(6:59:05) time I think in any relationship especially long term you're constantly don't change over time I'm talking about follow through if one man does not
(6:59:12) change and the woman changes her no follow through is I'm saying I'm going to do something for you and I don't do
(6:59:18) it changing your mind or changing the Dynamics of a relationship is just Evolution that's growing together or
(6:59:23) growing apart like those are those are those are two different I totally agree these are two separate arguments right
(6:59:29) and then you can gr we're talking about follow through though I'm saying that's not follow I have an uncompromising
(6:59:34) position to this relationship you're doing a false analogy follow it's not those aren't the
(6:59:41) same thing that's not follow-through you're describing something entirely different and then what you're describing is like everyone when you get
(6:59:47) into a relationship you decide the parameters of the relationship or at least you should if you're an adult right these are the expectations that I
(6:59:52) have values principles we need to agree on that if we're going to move forward in a serious way now if something happens for whatever reason and one of
(6:59:59) the parties changes their mind so let's use your example is like I'm never [ __ ] touching a dish and like you are
(7:00:04) so firm and that girl is like that's so hot I want to be a stay-at home and you go work and right that's the agreement
(7:00:11) something happens she changes her mind she's like I'm overwhelmed I actually really need I want to go work I'm I
(7:00:16) don't want to stay at home and I expect 50/50 and you don't want to budge because that's you know like your
(7:00:22) principles haven't changed well now you're no longer compatible but that's not it's not a followup through that
(7:00:27) thing wait you know this would be follow through so this would be the man following through the exactly what he
(7:00:32) said why he saided it when he saided it not changing a bit she changes right she
(7:00:38) changes she's actually not following through why is it that she decided to change her mind on all of these things
(7:00:45) that she agreed to that sounds like she's lacking the follow through follow hold on I've given you guys 15 minutes
(7:00:52) to discuss this you can each make one final Point keep it short go
(7:00:57) ahead my my point is men and women are fundamentally different and pretty much every way especially when it comes to
(7:01:03) arousal pleasure um what we perceive as as threats and um to talk about like
(7:01:10) values and what we value in a mate those are going to be different things so if we were saying we value follow through in a man you're that's not really valued
(7:01:17) in wi in women there's like a a category of like top six things follow through is not there a man being Dependable is like
(7:01:23) top three of what women want so yeah you can't compare what you want from a man from a woman unless you want to date a
(7:01:29) dude and my my I would I would just say this that the uh the actual position
(7:01:34) contradicts itself almost immediately the second we get into it and also I would further State she is right men and
(7:01:40) women are different that women often will succumb to social pressure and won't tell the truth based on uh
(7:01:47) expectations that they have because socially it looks really bad for them so in the case of like well men aren't
(7:01:52) really following through here and that's what's happening we actually demonstrated the reverse that if the man
(7:01:58) continues with his exact line that he started the relationship with she changes her mind it's a lack of follow
(7:02:03) through on her part right and there's no way around that and so what what ends up happening is but that doesn't sounds
(7:02:10) socially great to say well the woman here really she changed it up halfway
(7:02:15) through and he stayed the same so inste she says well the man's just not growing with the woman right this is part of how
(7:02:22) women tend to lie when it comes to the idea uh socially that wasn't a
(7:02:28) lie I'm not saying you're lying I'm not saying you're lying I'm saying this is a a great example of how it is that when
(7:02:36) there's social pressures and you don't want to say what's true because it sounds bad makes women look bad right
(7:02:41) then what happens is colorful language like follow through why isn't this man following through upon the changes in
(7:02:47) the mental state the woman has why is he supposed to follow through on her [ __ ] mental States follow through on
(7:02:55) what your was as a man I have to move it on I have to move it on you said you got the text what let's go into that
(7:03:02) oh for the thing yeah let me see if I got a name I thought we already settled it with the Bowing well I thought you
(7:03:07) said there was like more info that came
(7:03:14) through yeah it's again just more running around in circles so yeah nothing worth sharing uh and then we
(7:03:20) need a couple of tweets I guess the only thing left in your notes Candace is that you said you see a tendency to pick
(7:03:26) girls for the show to belittle them and show them in an awful light this is from some of your earlier messages on if this
() 
(7:03:32) is still your position or if it is still your position or um I think that you
(7:03:38) have in the past and I I mean I can't speak Beyond this panel because the only one I've I've seen and then versus Clips
(7:03:45) but when I see certain behaviors um coming out from some of the female guests there's no way you didn't know
(7:03:50) that they were going to respond in a certain way or just be like massively underprepared for like the pressure of coming on a Big Show or um like you kind
(7:03:58) of know what personality and like obviously Andrew knows exactly what strings to pull and you can get a
(7:04:05) reaction out of that and right it's the clip economy so it is what it is but
(7:04:11) there I mean there absolutely is a a pattern there I mean you can go through completely honest I don't ever know
(7:04:16) who's going on the show until the day of the show well whoever's in charge of of booking then you know what I mean like
(7:04:21) but you but you referenc me no I said you're good at pulling strings that's what I was saying yeah sure sure but
(7:04:27) that can't be because I have a preconceived notion of how to do this with the person because not what I said
(7:04:32) that's not what I said yeah I'm just pointing out that literally until the day of the show Brian does not actually
(7:04:39) share that information with me I don't think I've ever really asked him to to be fair no one said he doesn't what that
(7:04:45) no one said that you had the information who was going on the show yeah there's a there is an inference there when you say
(7:04:51) well we're not allowed to infer earlier I when you say I believe that the people who come on the show you're specifically
(7:04:57) vetting them for the purposes of being able to push their buttons well here I didn't that either
(7:05:02) now case in point here right I think Lily Phillips is on the show today because she's famous because she wants to [ __ ] a thousand guys right and she
(7:05:09) just had a bunch of viral Clips that's why I think she's here I don't think she that she's here for the nefarious reason
(7:05:15) of Brian wanting to push her buttons I don't think that that's particularly I'm here to debate important issues she
(7:05:21) pushed my buttons yeah right but you wouldn't be here debating those important issues
(7:05:27) there wasn't some notoriety which made you worth debating those important issues with yeah but you can't compare
(7:05:32) her to a lot of the other girls that have like these viral clips that have no social media following that aren't
(7:05:39) engaging in a conversation that are super emotional or they come here to like I do see a lot of girls coming to
(7:05:44) pick fights and that has happened more and it has changed my opinion a little bit about the show well like but I'll
(7:05:49) invite people on who like clearly disagree with me or have negative attitudes toward the podcast I mean she
(7:05:55) said this the podcast is stupid and my response is not to be like well [ __ ] you you're stupid I'm like come on the show
(7:06:00) Let Me Hear You Out um and I think you maybe in your first message you had perhaps some negative
(7:06:06) conations or negative opinions toward the podcast uh my response to criticism and I've had really actually some really
(7:06:12) nasty initial messages like straight up insulting um you know they'll call me ugly whatever I won't even insult them
(7:06:18) back I'll just be like come on the show and let's have a conversation about it um so I'm actually quite open to hearing
(7:06:24) contrary uh opinions and positions uh but um also can you make the point very
(7:06:31) quick that like all of what any of these guests would ever have to do is watch
(7:06:36) one or two episodes and do their due diligence to very quickly ascertain what
(7:06:42) they would be in for or not in for like didn't you do that didn't all of you guys do that well yeah and then I mean
(7:06:49) there was also ground rules like be respectful but that's been broken a thousand times and other topics
(7:06:55) respectful to you I think you've been disrespectful to almost everyone on this panel at some point yeah I know but
(7:07:00) that's what here's the thing is so funny this is why I call you a feminist right I literally am not treating you any
(7:07:06) differently than I would treat any other man who was sitting exactly where you're sitting the problem is is that inside of
(7:07:12) most women's Brains they pretend that they want to be treated equally or they pretend that they want egalitarianism
(7:07:18) and then the second you give them egalitarianism they get very upset right we haven't actually had any insulting
(7:07:24) exchanges yes you actually called her dumb very loud and clear I didn't call her dumb definitely did it was it was
(7:07:31) stupid one of the yeah no no no I call chair One D What saying that's what I'm saying
(7:07:38) yeah but that has nothing to do with her I haven't been disrespectful you can excuse every insult you make it's
() 
(7:07:44) incredible I have to give you credit for that it's actually incredible well she's been actually engaging and by the way I
(7:07:50) haven't insulted you either what did I insult you with no my point is that you can literally excuse everything you do
(7:07:55) and make it right because your biggest priority is to be right and I have to give you kudos to that you're good at it
(7:08:02) yeah but but if your priority is to be right because you are right what's wrong with that you made my point clear thank
(7:08:08) you yeah as an example for for example you made my point clear too thank you so anyway back to this real quick for
(7:08:14) example it's very I don't think you're right all the time go ahead go ahead that's fine and I'm wrong sometimes I'm
(7:08:20) just been wrong hold on go ahead Aya go ahead just use a very quick example you were like uh oh you've been very
(7:08:26) disrespectful and then he was like well who have I who's been disrespectful or something no yeah yeah you're like
(7:08:32) people are very disrespectful here and then he like sort of challenged this and then he said well you have been and then he said well yeah and then I quickly
(7:08:38) shifted the topic just like as example is like sort of the conversational strategy that I think is like regularly
(7:08:43) at play here I'm happy to engage with the topic I asked her I actually asked her how have I been disrespectful to you
(7:08:50) and the answer the answer is how well what yeah what what have I done have I
(7:08:56) because I'm patched in remotely you have several conversational techniques because hang on stop that's
(7:09:03) disrespectful so because I've had to interject a couple of times cuz I'm in I'm patched in remotely I'm not in the
(7:09:08) studio like what have I actually said to you that's actually disrespectful except challenge your
(7:09:14) views not you Aya I'm talking I'm not talking to a no for me it would be the
(7:09:20) constant Interruption then also the tone like there's a like tone is absolutely respectful or disrespectful and you call
(7:09:26) me I don't know why that's amusing but I wouldn't want anyone talking to my kid that way or like anyone that I cared
(7:09:33) about that way the tone your tone your tone has been super condescending I just don't comment on it I don't think that's
(7:09:39) true at all yeah I know you don't think that but you see these subjective metrics of tone give me something I said
(7:09:45) did I call you a [ __ ] did I call you a [ __ ] did I call you a skank did I say you're [ __ ] horrible did I I didn't
(7:09:51) say hang on I didn't say any of these things instead I simply challenged the things that you view as being true and
(7:09:59) gave you challenges to them what did I actually say to you though that was insulting you can be and I said
(7:10:05) disrespectful and not insulting and you can be disrespectful without blatantly calling some one a [ __ ] if that's like
(7:10:11) your only metric then of course you're not going to think that you're being then would you say in the future I should just go ahead and call women
(7:10:16) [ __ ] since I will hang on since I will instead be attacked as being disrespectful regardless no I'm giving
(7:10:23) you my experience with you and I feel that a lot of people would have my my opinion and I know a lot of people are
(7:10:28) going to have yours I'm telling you that I feel at this conversation has been very disrespectful with you I feel that
(7:10:34) you have been extraordinarily disrespectful your tone one thing from now on hang on from now on when you talk
(7:10:41) to me I need you to use a sing song voice The singest sest Voice you can
(7:10:46) possibly think of because otherwise I feel disrespected now I can't give you any particular words that You' said any
(7:10:53) particular phrases any particular insults because none of that matters what matters is that inside of my brain
(7:11:00) I perceive your non sing song voice as being [ __ ] disrespectful so that's how you
(7:11:07) that's okay you would be okay with someone talking to your wife that way say what saying [ __ ] would you be okay with someone talking to your wife
