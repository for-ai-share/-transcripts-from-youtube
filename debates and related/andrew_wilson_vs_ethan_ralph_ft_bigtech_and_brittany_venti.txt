(0:00) how about the two of us take a breath lier you first how about I beat your [ __ ] ass
(0:06) booh booh why don't you cry more [ __ ] Britney you [ __ ]
(0:12) [Music] [ __ ] son of a [ __ ] you mother never
(0:21) said anything about your dead son ever welcome to TP
() 
(0:27) USA did you want to watch the BPF takedown the V you think it might catch you off guard
(0:32) to find out that sloppy Rachel here is in her 40s saying that women shouldn't vote but it's actually not that
(0:38) surprising when you consider the fact that she pimped out her virginal daughter that she bragged about having a
(0:44) zero body count to a bunch of creepy men on the internet on Twitter I got a call
(0:50) from my daughter's ex-boyfriend and he basically threatened me he said is because FES is my king if you show up to
(0:55) that debate I'm going to do horrible things to you horrible things to your daughter and I asked the guy uh but this this is [ __ ] I'm calling [ __ ]
(1:02) Andrew I don't believe you because Fuentes is my king look you know what debate he's talking
(1:09) about he's talking about his debate with me he was supposed to debate me he
(1:16) agreed to it it was build he was out there I show up I'm on the killstream we're waiting for Andrew to get there
(1:21) and you know who shows up Zen Shapiro Andrew Dodges it and then he cops and
(1:28) says why do I need to debate you I don't need to give you uh airtime or deal with a guy who's crazy or he gave some sort
(1:34) of like gay thing of like I'm not going to I'm not going to bring content to your show and that and Ralph was like
(1:41) well [ __ ] you then and all that stuff remember that that was when he dodged the debate and here's his explanation for why me he
(1:48) said it's because FES is my king you show up to that debate I'm going to do horrible things to you horrible so he says that there's a griper who says
(1:55) because Fuentes is his King if you show up to that debate I'm going to do horrible thanks to you thanks to your
(2:00) daughter and I asked the guy what do you want and he's like you don't show up to that debate and you shut your mouth
(2:06) about about AF period but he's like if you show up to this debate if you show up I'm going to ruin her entire life
(2:11) after doing some re how could he do that how could he possibly ruin her entire life and why
(2:20) would he want you to not show up to a debate with me so this is from Rachel's daughter's Tik Tok and it says me when I
(2:25) remember I really almost married a 27-year-old man from New York that I
(2:31) only met three times because my parents wanted me to that's their daughter they
(2:38) wanted her to marry a gper that he she only met three times by the way I had I
(2:43) had a conversation with that gper and I still got the recording of it he came into my old server he came into the VC
(2:49) with me and some buddies we talked to him for like an hour and he told us all about his history with the Wilsons and
(2:55) he told me about her told me about why she had sort of a breakdown in their relationship when she learned some stuff
(3:00) about her family that she didn't know and she went through a crisis and wanted to break up and it was crazy and the the
(3:06) kid was sort of like trepidacious and nice and polite and heartbroken Andrew
(3:11) is like and then that kid called and said I'm going to do horrible things I believe that daughter claims that she
(3:17) was abused and assaulted for 2 years after doing the math and looking at the
(3:22) dates I don't believe it's the same gper because she says that she met the gper at 18 years old and doing the math here
(3:29) she would be around 15 or 16 years old when this other guy presumably abused
(3:35) and assaulted her for 2 years so what this means is that sloppy has a history
(3:40) of letting her daughter get treated horribly by the men what I heard was
(3:46) that the abuse was not Britney venty call me I'll tell you what I heard was that the abuse
(3:53) she's referencing the abuse and the assulting was not from a boyfriend
(4:02) it's from somebody a little closer to home so just to be clear her fiance was a grer part of the America first
(4:09) movement ran by Nick Fuentes this is where Britney vendy goes in on their dead kid [ __ ] up dude marries her
(4:16) first husband baby daddy number two who she has a child with that ends up passing away in a very tragic accident
(4:23) that in turn makes sloppy look like an extremely irresponsible parent there's a couple no don't say it that Britney no
(4:32) hey bad Optics Britney venty have news articles on this if you guys would like to read it for yourselves Britney
(4:40) venty you cannot AOG people about their dead kids even for a second even for
(4:46) that brief second that you did right there you
(4:52) just everything else you're saying just went out the window and you did that for two seconds that was too far
(5:01) even if she is a total [ __ ] piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] human loser you can't make fun of her pain for
(5:07) losing her child that's too far the thing is it's like why are you going after these
(5:13) people who are like Christian right wiers BPF and his wife
(5:19) are like shitty scum people they're not like good Christians
(5:26) or something they're first of all they're not even Christian that's all a mask that they're putting on their
(5:31) selves they're bad they're like wretched
(5:36) they're the type of people who you like get to know them you go like GH this is what you're like
(5:42) they're a mess she said her first two baby daddies
(5:48) left her why do you think and then Andrew was with her made a baby left her married a a black woman
(5:56) in like sh Shakisha or something like that for real like Shakisha Jones is like his wife's name in Reno then
(6:03) divorces her and goes back then has another daughter with B with base homeschool mom and then they found Jesus
(6:10) from J Di and the reason why is so that they can just be in all these arguments so
(6:18) Rachel wants to girl boss and tell everybody how they're not being traditional enough and she has exposed
(6:23) uh esoteric or occult feminism and wrote a book about it and she got deep be on Tucker Carlson and she's like there's a
(6:29) totally Trad homeschool mom their daughters are a mess Andrew Wilson we know what BPF is like he's he's like a
(6:36) what can you even say about him I mean it's just like all pure sophistry it's like well what do you mean by that and how can you even prove that and the
(6:43) repeating your word back to you differently than you said it and keni you this like the little [ __ ] slime
(6:49) [ __ ] throwing he's the worst and now he's latched on to Red Pill stuff and now he's getting around cuz he likes
(6:55) sitting around having these like horrible time wasting like [ __ ] bottom of the barrel debates like let's
(7:01) get a and a communist to argue about what's the best type of being a g
(7:06) communist or like whatever like Andrew Wilson is like Pro mix Pro immigration
(7:12) anti anti everything he's like don't fight back don't do
(7:17) anything let's just talk about it endlessly so my career can have endless content like that's essentially it and
(7:24) when I got into a debate with him one time I asked him all right well if it's not this what's your prescription for
(7:29) fixing it he's like there's lots of stuff we could do to like republici Traditional Values like what he's like I don't know you can like get you could do
(7:36) anything you could get Billboards you could take out ads and magazines I'm like your plan is to get Billboards and
(7:42) ads in magazines to be conservative and modest traditional you're going to
(7:48) overcome the subversion through like with the billions of dollars and they're in our schools they're in the they own
(7:54) Hol they got all the news agencies they run the military and you're going to beat them with Bill boards he literally
(8:00) said that like he doesn't have any concept of actually fixing it he just wants to endlessly talk about it and be
(8:06) right against these people who are wrong and I'm smarter than you and it's all heier for thanks Bry and now we got to
(8:16) hear we got to see Andrew vendy attacks me the only reason that I'm making this
(8:21) response is because one of these creators Britney venty has decided in her INF
(8:30) wisdom that she wanted to go after my children they just instantly assumed she
(8:35) must have slept with him and he must have have Revenge no proof at all I never said anything of the sort they
(8:41) just made the whole [ __ ] thing up off the top of their head no evidence
(8:46) whatsoever what happened when he called me right and he was threatening me is
(8:51) that I could tell that he was because they had been in this relationship that his heart was
(8:58) hurt because she broke it off with him Andrew we all just watched the clip you
(9:05) gave the reason for why you backed out of the debate with me the reason you gave is that he called you and
(9:13) threatened you and you said on that stream that he threatened to come after
(9:18) you and to ruin your daughter's life now you're saying that since Britney venty
(9:23) said it seems to imply that there was some sort of maybe nudes involved or something what else would ruin your
(9:29) daughter's life right what else would he have that could ruin her life you said that he threatened to ruin
(9:36) your daughter's life now you're saying you talked to him and you could tell his heart was hurt and you felt bad for him
(9:44) so you neglected that that's different than you talked to him and he threatened you and threatened to ruin your
(9:49) daughter's life now you're saying you talked to him and you like took pity on him and that's why you dodged the debate
(9:56) with me on the killstream that doesn't make any sense it's almost as if you lied on that
(10:05) stream you lied on that stream and told the guy you told us all that some gper
(10:11) threatened you and your daughter and that was your [ __ ] reason for dodging the debate with me and now that
(10:17) lie that you told has caught your daughter into trouble now because now your daughter is getting harassed on
(10:23) Instagram because Britney Genty has the idea that based on what you said it
(10:28) seems to imply that there was some sort of embarrassing Revenge involved which what else would
(10:34) it be other than if her boyfriend had maybe nudes or something it did seem to be implied it wasn't made up out of
(10:40) nowhere you seemed to imply that she put two and two together talked about it now
(10:47) your daughter is dealing with it because you lied you made that [ __ ] up he didn't
(10:52) threaten you he didn't say he was going to ruin your daughter's life you made that up and now you're walking it back
(10:58) this is all your fault well who's got the link to what Nick said about him I like respect Andrew he's out there fighting the good fight and doing
(11:04) everything he can I he's pressing through an unsurmountable odds and stuff like what did Nick say Nick says I feel
(11:10) sorry that I feuded with the Wilsons I have so much respect for them knowing this and we'll play the video well the
(11:18) the thing about their dead son we'll get to that in a second I have so much respect for them knowing this that they
(11:23) have persisted with their important work after such a life-shattering tragedy
(11:28) okay Nick this happened before Andrew met her they didn't
(11:35) persist in their important work after a life-shattering tragedy after based homeschool mom's son
(11:44) died and she was with the dad of that son then they broke up then she married
(11:50) Andrew who became the stepdad to the remaining daughters then later on they found Jay
(11:57) Dyer and became orthol larpers and then began the important work he picked up
(12:03) the scraps of a broken marriage called himself the dad of these
(12:08) this other man's girls and then became an internet debater with [ __ ]
(12:16) Shantel with Britney from politically provoked he teamed up with the ehore to
(12:21) do like a conservative debating thingy he was he's the original moo their important work
(12:34) persevered he never knew that kid it wasn't his
(12:41) son that was some other man's son died poor Andy having to deal with the
(12:46) grieving loss of another man's son you can say that Nick is virtue signaling but at least Nick didn't mock his dead
(12:53) son like you did I'm not mocking anybody's dead son
(12:59) this guy is grieving the loss of a boy that isn't his that he never met I'm
(13:05) mocking that well here's the thing here's the real thing I'm not in the camp of like uh don't make fun of
(13:11) it I'm not in that oh spare his feelings we're literally talking about a grown man's feelings I don't care this guy
(13:18) spent the this man sent the cops to my dad's house this man sent the police to
(13:23) my dad's house police went to my dad's house VIs
(13:28) visited him looking for me cuz he told them that I live with my dad because that's what they said on
(13:34) farms this [ __ ] sent the cops to my dad's house [ __ ] himy I'm not in the like oh it's too far
(13:42) [ __ ] him this guy sucks and I don't care about his feelings at all and if your son died 10
(13:49) years ago where's the clip where's the Nick clip booh booh why don't you cry more [ __ ]
(13:58) [ __ ] you wasn't even your kid anyway oh that was a sad thing you went through get the [ __ ] over it and get off the
(14:05) internet [ __ ] you you suck I don't like
(14:11) you also it's sad I have actual condolences but this whole [ __ ] sob
(14:17) story of like oh big sad eyes Andrew is going to come and say oh this is so
(14:22) Britney venty said something Britney venty shouldn't have
(14:28) done that that's across the internet rules
(14:36) lines shut up are you [ __ ] serious [ __ ] are you [ __ ] serious [ __ ] and
() 
(14:42) think you're going to get away with this you're not going to get away with
(14:47) this ever I'm on your ass forever
(14:55) now because you [ __ ] with people just because they [ __ ] with me just because you thought you could
(15:03) get some Kino Casino money that's why you did
(15:09) that and I [ __ ] hate you like I'm I'm not even kidding like I [ __ ] hate this [ __ ] this is a step kid he raised
(15:17) from youth who died who she decided that it was cool to
(15:23) go after well guess what [ __ ] nothing's off limits now nothing nothing not a
(15:29) goddamn thing not a goddamn [ __ ] thing so this is the kid
(15:35) that he's claiming is his child but it's actually baby daddy number two's child with sloppy Rachel so I guess
(15:41) technically what a dirty [ __ ]
(15:46) dude I won't even say what I would do to
(15:55) this let's continue do you want to know
(16:00) how his stepson died do do you really want to know that I guess we have to get
(16:06) into the driver 14 charged with three
(16:11) felonies and crash that killed quote sweet kid that's the same kid do you
(16:17) understand that's the same [ __ ] kid and you have the nerve to [ __ ] call somebody else a
(16:25) bad mother or a bad father she's attacking these people for their son
(16:32) dying do you understand that's Britney venty the fact that she would go
(16:39) here is unbelievable this might be an all time
(16:44) low I'm not kidding and I have you know my old saying when they go low I go
(16:51) lower but God damn this is just [ __ ]
(16:57) sick
(17:04) now moving over to my son it's not his son the first time that people have used the death of my son to
(17:11) go after me with it in order to hurt me he's just straight up saying my son he's not saying my wife's son which it is in
(17:18) the article it literally shows the kids biological Dad's reaction and okay well
(17:24) where well here's Andrew Wilson with his son at about age three raising him
(17:33) up picture do you see that picture Britney you [ __ ]
(17:39) [ __ ] do you see that picture unfort unfortunately that child
(17:47) is no longer with us but you try to act like he had nothing to do with this U
(17:53) bracing like you're a dirty [ __ ] like one of the dirtiest [ __ ]
(17:58) [ __ ] that ever [ __ ] exist and you know what and I I won't
(18:06) claim moral High Ground because I always say I don't do that and I won't but like
(18:13) this is like really really really [ __ ] love he has a different last name I understand that step parents
(18:20) sometimes will take the kid from the other marriage under their wing but in this specific instance this is very
(18:26) calculated this is on purpose so he can deflect criticism say horrible things things like this I have a thick this is
(18:32) ridiculous this but in this case v brought him up to show that Rachel was somehow negligent the story gets more
(18:39) interesting when she marries her first husband baby daddy number two who she has a child with that ends up passing
(18:46) away by the way we have the full story that in turn makes sloppy look like an extremely irresponsible parent you can
(18:52) see that I link the news articles in the description both of them are from Fox and it says the 10-year-old was unived
(19:00) at the hands of a 14-year-old friend and what is your sloppy wife doing allowing her 10-year-old son to hang out with a
(19:08) 14-year-old I'm allowed to comment on that and say that that's irresponsible I have rarely
(19:15) seen a YouTube video so disgusting we have a blood sport scheduled of
(19:21) course um Andrew Wilson versus Adam green zero system suck my dick [ __ ]

(26:37) minutes 5 hours 41 minutes you made a whopping $300 uh
(26:42) $327 actually that's impressive you want to talk about prophecy I want to bring up the prophecy that I told you two
(26:49) years ago about what would happen to your career uh after you sucked up to these these [ __ ] people and then your
(26:56) career I have 700 people watching me live right now on Rumble and
(27:03) another I got about 1,000 total if you want to add them all up wow that's that's crazy 1,000 total viewers yeah
(27:11) that's all I need [ __ ] yeah that's that's it the thing is Ethan is like look you've done your fair share of
(27:18) talking mad [ __ ] about everybody you done every I didn't say [ __ ] about you at all
(27:25) you have done every horrible [ __ ] thing hor things that's true and you've done them to me and then the expectation
(27:32) is that I'm supposed to be it was water under the bridge but you want to start talking [ __ ] and now it's not water
(27:37) water on the bridge anymore like that's the thing well here's here's the thing man right as everybody and their [ __ ]
(27:44) brother has decided that it's expedient to attack me because I happen to be getting very popular not attacking you
(27:50) man no listen listen everybody in their brother finds that expedient I find it
(27:55) interesting that not very long ago you were on the same exact [ __ ] bandwagon and suddenly we supposed to be buddies

(38:00) sure cuz you've done that before to almost everybody done before if I want to yeah yeah why do you so this my this
(38:07) my whole point man is like why ultimately I've never set up here as the
(38:13) king of morality Andrew and you know that as you take another Swig of your [ __ ] Al alcohol drink I'm sorry so
(38:20) the the the critique is because I fall short of my own morality that it's okay because you don't have
(38:27) smoker you you use profanity you Advocate you do this and that but you're
(38:34) the biggest Orthodox Christian on Earth well your wife just did the other night no she didn't what she said was
(38:41) cool what did she even say Ethan she said well what what's behind
(38:46) the bedroom between an orthodox marriage it's it's all good oh so we're not going
(38:51) to go police people's bedrooms oh that's crazy what a psychopath she is do you your wife up the ass do you have you
(38:58) been up the ass Ethan no are you sure did you squeal like a pig did you Ethan
(39:05) it's not even funny dude it's just dumb I don't know your wife's the one who talked about s being cool not me all
(39:12) right so so the very first chance you get what do you attack my wife I like your wife you're the one who started
(39:17) this it it didn't sound like that doesn't sound like something his wife would say doesn't it does just the other
(39:24) day sounds it sounds like the second the second
(39:30) there's any problem or the second that somebody's not kissing your ass you could go right to the [ __ ] you
(39:35) started in on this immediately no Ethan you did you said I heard you were
(39:41) talking [ __ ] blah blah blah blah because I just wanted to know why you were mad I wasn't trying to fight I just wanted to
(39:48) know why you were upset that I can't control a [ __ ] whole streaming
(39:53) website well Ethan yes of course I Set Side to time side or time aside tonight
(40:00) with Adam green we pre-agreed on this we've been hyping this debate up on both of our channels for a long time make
(40:07) sure we I've been hyping it up too Ethan let me finish and then you can finish okay we've been hyping the thing up
(40:13) we're ready to go we were mock talking [ __ ] to each other in the chat the whole nine yards we had the whole thing
(40:18) blustered ready to go okay come in you're 45 minutes late you're talking [ __ ] right away hang on Ethan let me
(40:25) finish pop in you're talking [ __ ] there was two options go to robot streamer or
(40:31) start a whole new stream on Rumble where less people will see the stream and so
(40:36) there were two options there and so I decided to try to fix the stream on Rumble which I
(40:43) did now that's not my fault no matter how many times you want to try to act
(40:49) like it is it's not my fault how how do you even fix a stream I'm curious about that I was watching
(40:57) start skiing basically what you have to do on Rumble is like you you I have Ram right and so you turn off the r stream
(41:04) for like I don't know 10 to 30 seconds and you do that I don't know sometimes it's one time sometimes it's five times
(41:12) uh and then it eventually Works um but why are you bringing up [ __ ] from years
(41:18) ago that your wife has already forgiven me for uh like I I I don't even
(41:24) understand this really like this is me well let me explain so that you understand okay but please I would ask
(41:30) that you not cut me off and I won't cut you off when you respond fine because this entire the entirety of this entire
(41:36) gay op smear which exists currently all came from a camp that was trying to bisch me and much of it was pushed by
(41:44) you you did plenty of streams where you viciously attacked her over and over again and the whole reason that this
(41:50) these venty all this [ __ ] is uh that they're attacking me with it is because
(41:56) of the same aogs Who hat your [ __ ] guts have somehow linked me as being some kind of like close pal with you and
(42:02) close pal with true it's never been true it's ridiculous but the thing is funny
(42:08) about it Ralph is that most of the [ __ ] that they're coming after me for is the same type of discredited G offs which
(42:14) you guys orchestrated so yeah I'm a little bit miffed about it a little tiny bit so
(42:20) first off the gers hate vendy so yeah I realized that so second off did I attack
(42:26) you and your wife yes I did and did we deserve that Ethan uh
(42:33) well you were attacking me pretty hard and call me a sex offender and call me everything else no you guys started that
(42:38) [ __ ] long before I ever even said a word about so you never say anything about me ever long before I ever said word about
(42:45) you long before I ever said a single word about you I just wanted to go on people's shows and debate long before I
(42:52) ever said a [ __ ] word about you you guys were on the [ __ ] offense because you were ordered to do so I wasn't
(42:59) ordered is it because you you were exposing Fuentes yeah because I'm not an America
(43:05) firster and I have a whole different [ __ ] viewpoint on that than most people were you guys like ever cool with
(43:12) Nick I've never I don't know yes they were his wife donated thousands of dollars I have no she didn't that's a
(43:19) lie she what I mean okay well how much then that's a lie less than 200 bucks
(43:25) probably have you ever talked to him Andrew totally in total like on a show have you
(43:31) talked I never have he's been dodging me not only I never talked to him once on a show right but every interaction I've
(43:38) had with him has been so minuscule and small that they're not even worth
(43:45) mentioning you know what I mean because I don't because I don't attack this guy
(43:50) right because I left this whole [ __ ] sector because of all the gay Ops and all the madness and all the crazy right
(43:56) I left the whole [ __ ] sector but all of this entire gay op which has come up and has been didn't do this to you I
(44:04) defended you tonight for like [ __ ] an hour yeah it's funny that a lot of the
(44:09) people who now defend me are the people who initially orchestrated this to begin with even Britney politically provoked
(44:15) adamant Defender now of Andrew Wilson right but before was one of the first to
(44:20) get behind it and push orchestrated the feet pics I didn't orchestrate that you
(44:25) [ __ ] yeah tell well tell us about why it was that beardson beerley orchestrated foot pcks on purpose he thought it was
(44:33) funny that's wait a wait a second hold on hold on hold on I don't know this lore can you guys tell me about the feet
(44:39) picks what are you talking abouten he can explain it if he would like let me explain I was in a debate with beeron
(44:44) beerley he's getting his ass kicked cuz he's [ __ ] half [ __ ] he sucks he's a loser [ __ ] and so what he did was he
(44:51) orchestrated that he they lifted a picture from my wife's Instagram he orchestrated DMS which which never
(44:56) happened in order to smear me and these guys who all knew that that was true Adam all of them knew it was true they
(45:03) pushed the smear as much as they possibly could and why what had I done
(45:08) well I had done nothing I hadn't done anything to any of these people I haven't done by the way I haven't done I
(45:14) never did anything to Britney venty I never did anything to Britney venty never did anything tree of logic those
(45:20) attacks are all orchestrated simply because in some kind of let me say something your wife messaged me last
(45:27) week with her debate with Stardust and she said hey ventti and tri loic are
(45:32) going to be sending in these people don't let them in and I said no
(45:37) problem yeah what's wrong with that uh the what's wrong with it is you're
(45:43) misrepresenting my character is what's wrong with it now when I'm this was last
(45:48) week talking about I'm fighting man like I don't know what to say like yeah but what I'm what I'm asking you
(45:55) specifically and I want to know the answer to this and I've always wanted to know the answer to this why did you people do
(46:01) that to me I never did anything to any of you why did you do that to
(46:06) me well it's not true that you never did anything you set up a only you put you
(46:12) set up a and you illegally streamed ramania you
(46:17) did L you illegally streamed my wrestling event he did a lot of
(46:23) different things okay well guess what but you did did that yeah after I was already attacked to defend myself sure
(46:30) yeah what do you mean defend yourself what I'm asking you is before there was ever anything before there was ever any
(46:36) beef before I I'd never done anything to you before there was ever anything why
(46:42) did you guys come for me so hard when I had never done anything to any of you why telling me that you defended
(46:49) yourself after we came for you sure but why did you guys do it to begin with about Nick what were you saying about
(46:55) Nick that made him attack you I'm curious I'm not rehashing all of this dude I want to hear he doesn't want yeah
(47:03) because he's afraid he'll piss off Nick that's why well because they're sick they're sick they've they've probably
(47:08) made his life but but he'll say anything to me but he won't say a goddamn thing to Nick FES matter of fact he sucks up to Nick
(47:15) FES on the con on Twitter we all know they suck we all know the so we go do it
(47:21) you do it the guy the guy said that he was sorry for hor things that that had
(47:27) happened between but you do that you don't suck up finish Ral all I said to

(52:02) those things that you said that you went after me for I didn't [ __ ] deserve any of that competent drunk and a
(52:09) [ __ ] super dos hacker at the same time how does that even make any [ __ ] sense because the thing that's
(52:15) interesting and has always been interesting is that there's all sorts of broken crazy people on the internet as
(52:21) you know and they will Farm out the proxies anything for petty Revenge and for a way to stab another person in the
(52:27) back and for a way to do horrible things for just like pinches of money these
(52:33) insane people and Ralph what are you that kind of money yeah I don't go bro I
(52:40) have never participated in any of the gay Ops never done it it's I've never
(52:45) done it I don't believe that well give rlem Mania uh so that's a gay op I know
(52:53) I went on [ __ ] what no first of all that wasn't illegal stre that was on your site no that wasn't illegal at all
(52:59) and what was illegal about it uh you provided almost no commentary and you restream my wrestling event that I
(53:05) charge money for it's all fair use that shit's all fair use no it's not no it's
(53:10) not but even then even then you know what if that was actually something which was harmful right that I finally
(53:16) did in defensive myself sure I'll apologize for that so you admit you admit you did
(53:22) that that that I restream Ralph Mania yeah sure I still think it's fair use should have
(53:27) done it wasn't fair use I think I think it I think it was fair use but even if it wasn't sure I'll concede to that the

(53:53) on the stream and they had a picture I think of your mom on The Stream and they
(53:58) were talking [ __ ] to the Effigy and I said this is so [ __ ] this is so gross I said literally this is so gross and
(54:05) distasteful I can't watch it those were my words when your mom passed my wife
(54:10) sent you one of the [ __ ] most heartfelt letters I ever seen in my life and in exchange for that you tried to

(56:02) tell me how horrible I am that you want my family to die obvious you don't want to face Adam and that's why you tried to pick on me at first I just said I'm
(56:09) happy to do the debate right this second we're both here do you want to do
(56:14) the [ __ ] debate Ethan or do you want to Spur and talk a bunch of [ __ ] SP cut the stream you're the one
(56:20) sping which thing you want to do Ethan what do you want to do Adam
(56:27) we're already an hour and a half late I don't know maybe reschedule if you guys want to reschedule and do it I'll do it
(56:34) I mean you guys just did your own hour Blood Sport so like I me good this [ __ ] needs to get
(56:40) out needed to get hashed out a long time ago let's admit it what no I got hashed
(56:45) out because you got your by way Andrew your chat was saying excuse me your chat was saying that uh the our
(56:54) stream hadn't started started cuz I was late that's why I said I'm ready you morons did I say that well you saw my
(57:01) comment and you thought I was saying like I'm ready for you [ __ ] oh yeah yeah but that's just hype I know you were joking yeah I let you know yeah
(57:08) I've never had a bad relationship try to always keep good relationship with everybody even people I fundamentally disagree with doesn't seem but you know
(57:15) well well here's the thing Adam green hasn't [ __ ] saided every horrid [ __ ] thing they could possibly say
(57:21) about my family for the purpose of political expediency money was put behind
(57:27) us yeah well Ethan again all I ever wanted from you was and I offended you
(57:33) for a full hour and a half toight and I'm glad and bro I'm glad that you did and that's doing the right thing
(57:38) sometimes doing the right thing is hard but all I ever wanted from you was just an actual heartfelt apology and an explanation for why you did that to me I
(57:45) just I've always want know why I did it what the [ __ ] I was on the other team because money right it was it was
(57:51) financially I was on the other team it's that simple so will you push out I just want to know
(57:59) this will you push out your own morals your own morality the things that you think are right or wrong will you push
(58:05) those out just based on the team that you signed your [ __ ] contract
(58:11) with yeah all right I guess that's that's all I needed
(58:17) to know ma'am I mean if I'm on one side and you're on the other what do you expect like I don't
(58:25) know what to say like I expect you to remember just like I always tried to
(58:31) that there's a human being on the other end one night I want I'll tell you a story one night some a guy who I was
(58:37) watching streaming was so [ __ ] up that I actually DM gers who hated me and told
(58:44) them that they needed to inter seene because I thought you were going to [ __ ] K yourself I thought I've always thought
(58:49) that there was a human being on the other end Ethan and I never wanted anything bad to happen to any of you
(58:55) guys and do you think I really want something bad to happen to your family dude I say that [ __ ] online because
(59:01) that's [ __ ] shocking statement that's what I am shock because you're on the other side and like you said if you sign
(59:07) contct talking [ __ ] about me no because when you sign a I didn't say a word about you before you guys came for me
(59:13) Ethan and when you signed a contract in [ __ ] blood with those guys you did they're [ __ ] bidding you came for me
(59:20) you came for me you came for me and then he blamed me because in the end when all these [ __ ] aogs all these gers all
(59:26) these people are fighting with each other non-stop I walk the [ __ ] away from all the Carnage because I do have a
(59:31) family to protect and what's that supposed to
(59:36) mean that wasn't a shot at your your family I was just saying I have a family to protect of course I walked it sounded
(59:43) like a shot of my family no don't take it that way cuz it wasn't meant that way well I mean that's clearly was I've
(59:48) never said a word like that Ethan well you just did no I said I walked away
(59:55) clearly not [ __ ] drunk also which is really pissing me off I wish I was
(1:00:01) [ __ ] drunk if you want clearly you're clearly drunk what what take the breathalyzer take it no do it well right
(1:00:09) because you're drunk what kind of blood Sports would it be if he hadn't had a little bit of alcohol Andrew come on I've had beers tonight you've had beers
(1:00:15) he's not that drunk why are you like here's the thing thing because you keep saying he's drunk but he's like he's not
(1:00:20) like I get I get it I get it that your friends stuff like that you know what I mean just I'm being honest if the guy's
(1:00:26) not drunk can you give me a single good reason why he wouldn't just take a breathalyzer and then I would look stupid because the breathalyzer I don't
(1:00:32) even know where it is it's somewhere in this [ __ ] room [ __ ] mexic then then why did you offer to take it
(1:00:38) because I was talking [ __ ] that's why right that's what I do I talk [ __ ]
(1:00:44) online for I thought about challenging you to a drink off along with the debate tonight to make it
(1:00:50) interesting you'll you'll lose to my Irish I probably would lose that Irish
(1:00:56) but that but that aside right I'm just saying to you again yeah did this need
(1:01:01) to be rehashed yeah did you do you need to answer for some of this Ethan to me especially yeah I think you do I think
(1:01:07) you need to answer to some of it yeah but I think some of this should have been talked about off Air instead of an
(1:01:13) ambush right at the top of my [ __ ] show how could I Ambush you when the second I come on you start talking [ __ ]
(1:01:18) to me I didn't talk [ __ ] I said you were talking [ __ ] to me I was like why I
(1:01:23) didn't understand understand why bro all I said was that you were
(1:01:29) taking [ __ ] forever to get the stream going that's it barely said
(1:01:35) anything and he freaked out the second I came on because people said oh he's talking [ __ ] about you br yeah because
(1:01:41) you're listening to the same [ __ ] trolls been trolling you for years Ethan okay well do you want to put this behind
(1:01:47) us or no well I would like still just the answer to the one question well well I
(1:01:53) guess you did answer it you said if there's a contract with the Enemy or whatever team is opposing Andrew and you
(1:02:00) sign up with him because there's better bread over there the only team I have now is Ethan Ralph The Kills yeah until
(1:02:05) there's not Ethan Ralph until it's somebody else and some other team he would being loyal to them cuz CU they
(1:02:12) had his back and they were loyal to him that's exactly right that's what was going on that's exactly right and Ethan
(1:02:18) I'm going to be a moderator a little bit it is true Andrew wasn't really talking [ __ ] about you he was just saying like what's going on and someone almost 30
(1:02:24) minutes you know because he had a big audience there waiting he was actually trying to talk [ __ ] about me a lot more than you so and
(1:02:32) fair enough and you know maybe I got riled up by some people who wanted to get me riled up that's happen CH loves
(1:02:38) to do that they always love to say people happened before and we have had a lot of history and a lot of it is bad
(1:02:45) and most of it is on my side that being said fair use why did you stream it on
(1:02:51) comy and not YouTube I don't agree with you guys needed to Hash this out though
(1:02:57) we could this weak that's the weakest [ __ ] defense ever is that I ReRe
(1:03:03) something that you did once you mean you ReRe something that I made $10,000 off of and you I'm glad that you bro you sto
(1:03:11) money from me Bas if all if if the only thing that you have is that after ruthlessly attacking me for [ __ ]
(1:03:17) months and months and months I finally did something about it that's the that's the [ __ ] counter dude you look like a
(1:03:24) for months with your [ __ ] cozy clone like everybody knows that even even Cog
(1:03:30) made fun of you you know you know what's funny is that all these same people who you who you claim this about they were
(1:03:37) all clamoring to get on as fast as they [ __ ] possibly could and just like they're clamoring just like they're
(1:03:43) clamoring to grab my [ __ ] coattails right [ __ ] now because they want that
(1:03:48) [ __ ] did I clamor for that or did you say hey I'm ready for a killstream debate let's do you know I wanted I
(1:03:54) always go where the debates are I don't give a [ __ ] who hosts them I don't care about the platform I like and enjoy debates but the thing is Ethan is that
(1:04:02) in this case right you brought this [ __ ] up might as well [ __ ] hash it out and
(1:04:07) I want to know I wanted to know why you did that and I got the answer I guess I got the answer now can we put it behind
(1:04:14) us and still be cool or is that not a possibility yeah we can put it behind us
(1:04:19) and I even forgive you for everything every and I told you this before I forgive you for every horrible thing that you've done but I'm just going to
(1:04:25) be completely honest with you right iin never going to [ __ ] trust you Ethan
(1:04:30) ever that's fine I don't worry about that sort of thing all right well then if you want to put it behind want to try
(1:04:37) if you want to continue to participate in in debates on the
(1:04:42) killstream do you yeah wherever there's a debate that's where I want to be
(1:04:49) yeah can we come to some sort of I think
(1:04:54) we already did well I would like to put a bow on it
(1:04:59) I guess you might say um well then then here's the here's the bow right I've
(1:05:05) forgiven everybody who's ever come after me and move past came way harder than I
(1:05:10) did by the way you were part of the gr I was a part of it that's true but
(1:05:15) they a lot more I forgave I forgave all of them to and I moved the [ __ ] on to bigger and better things as well I'm
(1:05:22) supposed to do okay I'm not trying to get bogged down with all this [ __ ] nonsense and craziness especially with a
(1:05:29) sector where the entire the entirety of the sector is to create as much conflict
(1:05:36) and problem and [ __ ] situation conversation man you know that right
(1:05:41) well I mean it happened so well I know it's already happened now I mean there is no taking it back now but again again
(1:05:49) I forgave everybody coming out and still do I don't give a [ __ ] much like Destiny
(1:05:55) in fact same I kind of have the same exact uh mentality he does wherever the debate is that's where I want to be I
(1:06:01) don't care if the debates on the killstream I don't care if the debates on some liberal's [ __ ] Channel I don't care where the debate is I want to
(1:06:07) be involved slugging it out with some other [ __ ] guy I don't care I'm just telling you what I think about you so
(1:06:13) that you know yes I can put it all behind me and yes I'll still even participate in the bait everywhere on
(1:06:18) the [ __ ] internet I don't care where they are but I'll never [ __ ] trust you again after you did that to me for nothing
(1:06:25) I don't trust anybody online so all right fair enough and you'd be a
(1:06:31) fool to do so so yeah I've learned I've learned you learned yeah learned you'd
(1:06:37) be a fool to trust anybody on this um now can we put this behind us and still
(1:06:46) we already did we put the bow on it and everything and yeah we can still have the debate and I'm still willing to do it right this second against Adam green
(1:06:53) happily well let's go let's
(1:06:58) go oh my godra Fu you Andrew moral
(1:07:05) grandstanding uh well I guess I'll let Adam start off see now he's call me a drunk I'm not drunk is the [ __ ] thing
(1:07:12) God damn that makes me so angry because I have been to debates where I'm clearly [ __ ] out of my mind drunk and I'm not
(1:07:21) but anyway R would never be out of his mind for this thing look at all the people watching tonight he like what the
(1:07:26) [ __ ] I was seriously trying to like never even think about being [ __ ] up
(1:07:31) for this debate because I wanted to take it seriously and then we get into this big fight at the beginning and maybe it
(1:07:38) needed to happen I don't know um I feel like it could have happened off air I've talked to your wife off air well look

(1:12:56) say and just make inferences just listen to what I'm saying to you but you act like I did like I did

(1:17:46) back to running that one trick pony show you call a debate Channel sorry not sorry your wife send her Hobbit fet to
(1:17:53) 5T 3 in Chad like beardson while you drink in your basement and look I knew the beardson thing was fake like that
(1:17:59) went along with that as a joke like I mean what the [ __ ] I don't know what to say like funny how people always go in
(1:18:05) the the hindsight and say well how many things you said about me is a joke like I mean barely anything Ethan you said I
(1:18:13) was drunk tonight which I'm not you are drunk tonight no I'm not why the [ __ ] do you think I'm drunk people have seen me
(1:18:19) drunk very drunk Adam let's see if Adam will be completely
(1:18:25) honest here Ethan strong yeah he may have had a little bit but he
(1:18:31) doesn't seem like he's not too drunk to conduct the interview he's done an hour and a half how long has he been
(1:18:36) streaming like for 4 hours yeah but I guess this became a grudge match between me and him but I'm just saying yeah I
(1:18:41) know you guys are exhausting me I'm going through an emotional roller coaster right now yeah well we needed a moderator guess we needed a [ __ ]
(1:18:48) moderator I guess Adam you know we needed a [ __ ] moderator to this [ __ ]
(1:18:53) out welcome I mean it seems like Ralph and your wife are cool you they were talking earlier saying we were talking I
(1:18:59) defended him for an hour I'm literally not kidding I defended him for an hour and a half over this venting just
(1:19:05) absolute trash I never attacked your dead son ever not even once not even
(1:19:10) during the worst [ __ ] times did ever say anything about that worse than that
(1:19:17) you know that okay there we go I I'm sorry I lost connection I don't I have no idea what
(1:19:24) just happened can you hear me now never once during all that blood Feud did I
(1:19:30) ever attack the death of your son
(1:19:35) ever will you admit that I well I I don't know I'll just take your word for
(1:19:40) it though well you don't have any you've never seen that happen no I haven't
(1:19:46) never seen that happen that's true so I'll take your word for it but
(1:19:51) just that's true but I didn't say those things yeah but the question the the
(1:19:57) question still for me was I just always wanted to know why I wanted to know why it was was it because uh Ralph hated me
(1:20:07) or was it because it would just make him some [ __ ] cash and it was politically expedient to do it and you kind of you
(1:20:14) answered the question right if I asked you hey if you had a contract with somebody else would you do it again I didn't actually have a contract by the
(1:20:20) way well I'm not saying it was a for contract right like I didn't get paid to I only made my own money on cozy nobody
(1:20:27) paid me to stream there yeah but doesn't that make it worse that you go after people who were your I don't know maybe
(1:20:33) it does I don't know depends on your opinion like we were we were your friends man you know I know when I thought we
(1:20:39) were friends again and now I'm just like what the [ __ ]
(1:20:45) uh well I'm just I'm just I'm just explaining to you like once once upon a time you know we started out as at least
(1:20:52) friend friend I know that you say hey um there's no there's no friends online I agree with you now right at the begin of
(1:21:00) from killstream from going on Ralph's show and debating people yeah and I have no problems with green we talk all the
(1:21:05) time I don't have any issues with him we talk a little smack this type of thing but none of it is taken personally but
(1:21:12) man you know I'm just saying you [ __ ] you came pretty hard without anybody
(1:21:18) ever doing anything to you and yeah I do think that that's [ __ ] up and do think
(1:21:23) that's [ __ ] I do think that uh you did like a lot of the problems Ethan
(1:21:29) honestly in your life you know are caused by you you know that I know that
(1:21:34) ever deny that yeah exactly right there a lot of them are caused by you I just
(1:21:39) saw him say that the other day actually I don't but I have never ever attacked
(1:21:46) anybody in your family I've never attacked any of your significant others I've never even said a bad word I think
(1:21:51) about pansu I don't I don't even think that that ever even happened I don't know who that is well you see what I'm
(1:21:56) saying though okay you get the point yeah that's all I'm saying um
(1:22:04) so anyway we can we can loop on this forever more he say sorry Andrew it sounded like a sincere sorry too to be
(1:22:12) honest and and maybe it is but I'm just saying like look if there's debates on the kill stream you got good debates for
