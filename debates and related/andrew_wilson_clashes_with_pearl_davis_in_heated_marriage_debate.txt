(0:00) i i'm not saying one way or the other i'm saying i don't see them changing anytime soon that's it i don't yeah yeah
(0:08) i don't think i don't think in my lifetime they'll be major but ultimately do you want to see them change it would
(0:13) be nice yeah so so then if that if that's the case let's i'll just assume the position for a moment your position
(0:19) just descriptors here's where we're going mhm it would still be really wise to have men's rights advocacy groups and
(0:26) things like this in place for this inevitable decline so that those types of policies can then be pushed so that
(0:33) we're like ready for them right sure but the first one was in 1910 so i don't if
(0:39) if we're where we are today and the first one was over a hundred years ago the first what policy no the first men's
(0:45) right to advoc i think it was around 1910 i don't know the exact yeah but they were advocating for completely different things right um andrew wilson
(0:54) clashes with pearl davis in a debate about dating and marriage in today's
(1:00) climate now pearl davis here is obviously a black pillar she is always
(1:06) doom and gloom about love yeah but the nothing in it for the men there's nothing in it for the men so why did he
(1:12) even try you know what and andrew here is trying to correct is trying to
(1:18) correct the ship she offers no prescriptions she just wants to paint about how doom and gloom it is look ve
(1:23) at a very pessimistic outlook and while andrew wilson acknowledges that there are negative things to today's marriages
(1:30) and marriage laws and things like that he at least offers prescriptions and at
(1:36) least offers some hope let's see how this debate goes down predictive model i agree i'm not going to get into like
() 
(1:42) morals or ethics with you that's not what i mean by good or bad like moral or immoral right right but like is it bad
(1:48) for women generally to be promiscuous like does it lower their value structure
(1:54) um you could say that yeah but i don't really always see promiscuous women have
(2:01) bad outcomes in real life unfortunately yeah well the thing is is like because
(2:07) if it is the case that you you think that men are going to check out of society they're going to well they're
(2:12) going to check out and become promiscuous because marriage is a raw deal right then you're actually assigning well some men don't care
(2:18) enough to even like like some men are just going to check out they're not even going to try to get sex yeah yeah i
(2:24) agree i agree with that so but wouldn't you be assigning these promiscuous women value then wouldn't they actually be a
(2:31) valuable asset to society if it is the case that if men can't get married and can just play the field and have sex
(2:36) with tons of women wouldn't they actually be very valuable to men then why would they be valuable to men well
(2:42) because obviously men want to [ __ ] them right and if they're if they're losing well men need sex right that is a need
(2:48) for a guy so then these women would be valuable right well i think if they were val valuable they'd marry them wouldn't
(2:55) they well so yeah that's a fundamental question though if you're not going to marry that's the whole point if you're
(3:01) not going to marry them and you're just going to have sex with them then the values in the sex itself yeah i mean men
(3:07) do want to have sex yeah yeah so then that would be what would make women valuable is that they were essentially
(3:14) that that they were hoes essentially would make them value i mean they bring more value than the wives that are married and they don't sleep with their
(3:20) husbands you think you think hoes bring more value than wives than ones that
(3:26) don't sleep with their husbands which is really common yeah well i i went through
(3:31) and pulled a bunch of the stats right so um when it especially when it comes to
(3:37) sexless marriages that usually happens uh years into the marriage over a decade in fact before that starts after after
(3:44) the youngest kids goes to preschool yeah yeah that's often often the case and often those are only for limited amounts
(3:50) of time right though not always right but it's actually a more isolated case when i look at the this is from petray
(3:58) uh i'm sorry petrelli preveter llc they pulled up a they made a study on this
(4:04) when we're talking about christian marriage because you're asking what's the incentive for men to get married well from a secular standpoint i think i
(4:10) agree with you that secularist men probably shouldn't it looks like it doesn't but we're in we're in a secular
(4:16) society andrew not yet we're we're getting there but we're not there yet you don't think it's pretty secular now
(4:24) not yet like what like what percent of people even attend church weekly well that's true but 70% of the population
(4:30) does consider themselves to be at least identify selfidentifies as christian but
(4:36) like don't you need actions to match that yeah you do but interestingly enough it must be because it's only 20
(4:43) to 25% of christian marriages which end in divorce at all i mean that's again
(4:48) what you guys say right i mean that's what the stats show okay yeah 20 20 to
(4:55) 25% but gen z you don't know what gen z is going to be and that's the whole point i mean wouldn't they follow the
(5:01) same trends roughly i would guess it would be worse
(5:08) why because gen z women are the first women that are on social media plus
(5:14) divorce keeps going up over time well uh divorce is lower now than it has
(5:23) been ever right because people aren't getting married because correct because because you're kind of trying to divert the divorce isn't going up because the
(5:28) thing is you're trying to divert from the question if you want marriage to increase you have to give a good answer
(5:34) to the question because it's the only way that you can have it's the only way you can have children without single
(5:39) motherhood what do children get out of marriage uh well if the if mommy and daddy aren't
(5:45) married right then the children have very very bad outcomes single mother homes have terrible outcomes and single
(5:52) father homes aren't tenable generally speaking because they're the working parent right so the only way for women
(5:58) to have families is through marriage so what do women get out of marriage uh they generally get resources they
(6:04) generally get resources and they get access to status social status uh security things like this and what do
(6:11) men get out of marriage they get children out of marriage okay and what do they get out of marriage
(6:18) that they couldn't get from just a living girlfriend mothers so here's well an intact family
(6:25) in other words so here's the thing if the woman if the woman lives with him
(6:30) yeah well the the thing is is when we look at the other hang on hang on well
(6:36) let me respond to it if we look at the social data for what you're talking about this happens all the time that's
() 
(6:42) called a single mom right they you live with the chick you impregnate the chick you're not married to the chick those
(6:47) end up in crowder's in the same position so are a lot of like he doesn't have
(6:53) children with some no he doesn't he doesn't have children with a with some live-in girlfriend right right but he's
(6:59) not with the mother of his kids now he a really public divorce yeah but there's a different like i know but my point is
(7:04) you can say data data data all you want but when we're like people are witnessing conservative people that
(7:11) pushed a lot of this stuff getting divorced like men are going to naturally do a costbenefit analysis and realize
(7:18) there's no difference so here's the cost benefit here's a costbenefit analysis
(7:24) and so if you say my other question too would be who do the kids belong to do
(7:29) they belong to him or do they belong to her yeah so i believe in uh patrineal society i think that children belong to
(7:36) their fathers right and always have thought so and that would be a form of reform inside of the court and by the
(7:41) way traditionally this was always the way it happened but in society today where women get custody 90% of the time
(7:48) who do the kids belong to they do that's not the case anymore they don't get it 90% of the time they belong to her do
(7:54) they belong to her or do they belong to him well they belong to the court system they're the ones who are making the allocation and who where are the
(8:00) majority of the time who gets custody yeah that's generally speaking women i agree okay so what do men get out of
(8:07) marriage if the time the kids belong to her and not him okay but here's the
(8:12) thing you got to let me actually answer okay so i'll try to answer this question but it's comprehensive so the step one
(8:19) you have to reform the system the court system men have to move towards the reformation of the court system um that
(8:27) is that challenging yes but prenuptual agreements as cited i went and looked at the data again they are mostly enforced
(8:34) that is the case right but when they're contested when they're when they're let me finish pearl when they're contested
(8:41) you know because when they're contested you're not allowed to i'm not allowed to make a point you're you're still going to get
(8:48) dragged to court that's the problem so a lot of guys if the prenup is you're not
(8:53) going to get dragged to court that this is the this is the issue right like this is a performative contradiction here's
(8:58) how okay because you say that women are reliance upon these men for resources that's what women are getting out of it
(9:04) so why is it if you had a prenup they're not going to get resources why would they drag them to court
(9:09) why because they're spiteful why did why did crowder's wife would be why did crow
(9:14) crowder's wife got a bunch of money why did i know but why did crowder's wife leak footage to the press she didn't
(9:21) have to do that she'd probably because she thought it would help her case for resources right but the the problem is
(9:28) in the court of public opinion women are spiteful it's not always about money ashley st clair was offered a ton of
(9:34) money just to shut up right she didn't shut up yeah but here's the thing right
(9:39) ashley st clair is going to get the money either way right she has the kid in the arrangement that was not a
(9:44) marriage inside of a marriage if crowder had signed a prenup i bet you things would have been completely different
(9:50) across the board same thing with most men who are wealthy who sign prenuptual agreements they end up women women want
(9:57) the resources that's the whole gain right i want the resources resources if they can't get the resources it's an incentive for the behavior not only that
(10:04) but here's the other thing um if if you promote against marriage against the idea of marriage and i'm not saying that
(10:11) you like this idea that i'm michael nolles or something i'm telling men just take the plunge and take the risk no
(10:18) we're both doing risk mitigation pearl's doing risk mitigation i'm doing risk mitigation what i'm saying with with
(10:24) pearl saying with risk mitigation is for no man is it ever worth it so just play the field
(10:29) i did not i don't tell men what to do okay okay i don't i don't think it's my position i think i think it ultimately
(10:35) reduces to that though so the thing is is that my position is just this risk
(10:40) for risk mitigation if you want to have children in a family the best outcome for the kids are it's going to be
(10:46) marriage like no matter what it's going to be marriage um yeah that's risk that's what's in it for the kids and for
(10:53) the man and not for the man because when you get married you're just adding on another layer of what of now she can go
(11:01) for alimony cuz a lot of times it's not about the money andrew i mean yeah like sometimes
(11:06) it is the money but it's like men want to stop dealing with crazy women like the the amount of money men will pay to
(11:13) get a wife to stop nagging him and now she can contest she can if she chooses
(11:18) contest the prenup and drag him to court he could agree with the terms that she like asks for or whatever just to get it
(11:25) over with but it's like the spitefulness of women it's not necessarily always the
(11:31) money and so again you're going back to what's best for the kids right but you
(11:36) don't answer the question what's best for him what having a family is what's best for him right by every single
(11:42) conceivable metric having a family is what's best for me it sounds like uh see pearl will say "well i'm not telling men
() 
(11:48) what to do they could do whatever they want." which yeah technically she's right she's not saying men don't get married but when she's laying out all
(11:53) the negatives about what could happen in a marriage you know what i mean it it
(11:58) kind of you get the idea that yeah she's probably advising you that you probably shouldn't get married you know she's not
(12:04) saying "listen you could get married but these are the positives that you could uh you know that you could enjoy but
(12:09) these are the possible negative outcomes you know you got to weigh them and make the best decision for yourself." she's
(12:14) not saying that she's like "well marriage is [ __ ] because women are spiteful and you know the the law the
(12:21) the system is rigged against men in the terms of the courts and such so don't get married." like the systems are
(12:28) rigged against men in the courts so i'm not telling you not to but you know you can make your own decision but i'm just
(12:35) saying that's pretty much pearl here and it seems like what pearl is just saying is that like again like she brings up
(12:42) the court she brings up all these things but then at the end she goes "yeah but women are spiteful." so it just seems like she just doesn't like women you
(12:49) know what i mean i know it sounds funny because she's a woman but it sounds like she's just saying "well women are just the issue because they're spiteful." and
(12:57) so it's better off if maybe you just play the field you know just sleep with women because that's what men want
(13:02) anyway you know she's kind of looking at this like women are evil because they're spiteful men want just want sex anyway
(13:08) men don't even really like women they just want the sex so you know what why even bother with the marriage just sleep
(13:14) around it lowers the rates of stds it earns the the earning income goes up
() 
(13:20) their general welfare and happiness in a happy marriage goes way up we can tell because we can look at the suicidality
(13:26) of men who have gone through uh terrific divorces or who stay single right and
(13:31) their depression rates are sky-high all of these things are high why do you think they make more money in marriage
(13:38) well that would be the incentive for their kids well right to keep up with kids are cheap it's women's spending
(13:43) habits that are expensive right the botox the clothes yeah i mean
(13:49) we had your we had your wife we had your we had your um your wife on and she was going through the costs of kids it's not
(13:55) as expensive um seemingly as what people say according to yeah so i just just real quick 90 90% is up to 90% the vast
(14:04) overwhelming majority of prenuptual agreements are not successfully contested in court it seems like a
(14:10) massive incentive for women if they want to hold their resources even from a secular side to do this but if you
(14:16) combine this with the christian side the christian ethics side of very religious women the divorce rate goes down to damn
(14:22) near nil okay well do are most women religious in this society no okay but
(14:29) neither are most men okay right but so now you're going into like selling your religion right well only if you want to
(14:36) have a family if you want to have the most successful family yeah right but i mean orthodox is 1% of the population
(14:42) i'm not a religious show it's not just for orthodox i'm what i'm what i'm talking about is and again you're not
(14:49) really answering the question you're saying you might get your kids no what i'm saying is that by every single
(14:55) conceivable metric which is available for men men's the what is considered the
(15:01) loneliness epidemic or the number one reported mental health issue for men is that they're lonely they feel lonely if
(15:08) the if that is the case and loneliness goes away when they get married then it
(15:13) seems like what would be really good for men would be to get married in a good stable relationship your counter is but
(15:20) there's not that many marriageable women correct but there's never but you agree with that right so
(15:26) most men aren't getting a marriageable woman most men never got one right so
(15:31) most men it's not marriage isn't for them yeah but you can't create the conditionals most men like if like out
(15:39) of two men or 10 men over six aren't going to get a good deal right which
(15:46) which they never got a good deal so are you telling them to take a bad deal no i'm what i'm telling them specifically
(15:51) is very simple that the historic fact of the matter is is that most men never got
(15:56) to reproduce at all your chances of reproduction now are way higher than ever and the reason the sex drive is so
(16:03) high for men is because it's a biological imperative for reproduction otherwise you wouldn't get a boner and want to go have sex right especially not
(16:09) with uh uh good-looking younger-looking women that's the whole point of it if you if you want uh stability in society
(16:17) which is good for men you want stability uh against degeneracy which is also very good for men then you want stable
(16:24) marriages for men what does society give men in return for producing a stable
(16:31) society what do they give men in return well society never gave men anything for the production of stable societies fine
(16:39) but i'm asking today what do they give them in return yeah i mean for them what
(16:45) men get what men get in exchange for having a stable society is they get a stable society that's the exchange
(16:51) that's always been the exchange like historically men have always been fodder or they've always been war fought or
(16:57) they've always been basically treated poorly but the idea here that we we have to make perfect conditionals for
(17:03) marriage absent any risk or mitigating risk is silly that's impossible no matter what if men keep getting married
(17:10) what is the incentive for the laws to change whereas they're not well hang on
(17:15) they can still get married absent the state and that would still create conditionals for the laws to change if men keep having children what is the
(17:23) incentive for society to give them fairer laws well what do you mean if they had if
(17:29) they have children and there's there's prenuptual agreements in place women now have incentive to not destroy their own
(17:36) financial security but again so you're saying well she won't completely ruin your life right you're not saying a
(17:42) reward yeah but like you get enthusiastic sex with a hot a hot wife but there's a lot of you
(17:49) missed the point though that there's a lot of marriages that work what about the fact that there's so many marriages that work statistically that's just not
(17:56) true okay let's look at the statistics since you want to bring them up go ahead um you're looking at an estimate of 40%
(18:03) 40% of the marriages are failing okay the vast majority of them are still still not and as less people get married
(18:09) those marriages are actually working out what is the obesity rate in america oh it's overwhelming for men and women okay
(18:16) okay are most women men ecstatic to take on this enormous risk and responsibility for a fat wife no okay so again you have
(18:24) to answer the question what's in it for men i'm answering the question so what's in it for men is the only thing that's
(18:30) ever been in it for men family yeah and i i don't think it's going to be a good enough answer if you're right then men
(18:37) are going to sign up to get married you don't have to convince me i yeah but what about like what what about like the
(18:43) qualifiers of yeah so pearl uses a logic like well there's something more in it
() 
(18:49) for men more men would want to get married i mean i don't know men are still getting married yet you know pearl
(18:55) lists off this society that still sucks right but there's still men that are getting married i don't think the drop
(19:01) in marriages is because the system is rigged against men nick yeah i'm i know there are men out there who are scared
(19:07) to get married because of these risks that are going on society i understand that but i honestly think marriages are
(19:14) dropping now because of the femin uh the feminization of society like the the
(19:19) feminist movement i think that's i think that's why the marriage rates are
(19:26) dropping also this push into a more secular nation i i think those things
(19:31) combined is why marriage rates are dropping but i honestly don't think it's because men don't want to get married i
(19:38) think andrew is right that men do want to get married do men do want families men do want wives the only thing i will
(19:44) say about what andrew is is that he says that what men get out of it is children
(19:49) and yes men do get children but i also think the wife has a little bit more to do with it like you you could get a you
(19:55) get a wife that is willing to take care of you when you need to be taken care of
(20:00) well before anyway before when the traditional gender roles you would have a woman there the wife that would take
(20:07) care of your home that would take care of you make sure your meals are are cooked to make sure that when you're
(20:14) feeling sick that you're taken care of those were the duties when we still had
(20:19) the gender roles here in society but now that it's flipped upside down yeah i guess maybe nowadays i guess men
(20:26) just get children you know but what men want is for someone to love them to raise their children and to also
(20:34) love and take care of them you know men take care of women by
(20:39) providing them with protection with providing them with a stable household make sure that they're provided for and
(20:46) women provide by being nurturing taking care of their children or helping them raise
(20:52) the children taking care of their household things of that nature that's what it used to be anyway men have to
() 
(20:58) live in this world right we have to live in this world we live in a world full of degeneracy and basically horrifying
(21:06) things because of the instability of society and you almost disempower them in a way because you're saying they
(21:12) don't have the power to change the nature of law i just want them to make an informed decision yeah but i mean the
(21:18) the informed decision towards what their happiness whatever they want to do it's not my place to tell men do you think
(21:25) they want to be happy it's not my place to tell men how to live well do you think they want to be happy though well
(21:30) i think that happiness is a feeling that comes and goes so i don't really so you don't want them to be happy i think you
(21:36) just want to do what they want no i didn't say that i said it's a feeling that comes and goes yeah i think i think
(21:44) ultimately you would want men happy right um i want them to do what they want to
(21:50) do okay well do you think that most men want to be happy i'm not a preacher channel right i'm not i'm not saying
(21:56) that you're a preacher where i'm not preaching right now i'm just talking about the facts the facts of the matter are don't you think men want to be happy
(22:04) well if you if marriage makes them happy then i'm sure they'll sign up i'm sure the marriage rates will go up yeah
(22:10) that's not that's not an answer to the question i asked the qu the question i asked specifically is do you think men
(22:15) want to be happy yeah okay so if you think that men want
(22:21) to be happy and if we look at all of the data that we can possibly find on male promiscuity and happiness it doesn't
(22:28) look very good for them so even if it were the case that you advocate against marriage which is fair especially
(22:33) secondary advocate against marriage i see it i see it straw man i see it
(22:39) disappearing from the middle class completely i see it just becoming um
(22:44) something that the rich do and i see the birth rates continuing
(22:50) to decline and i see marriage going away because people like you can't give men
(22:55) good answers on why they get married should should wait should wait should
(23:01) accumulate that risk you're saying you're saying you're saying risk 40% of your income for 18
(23:09) years if you have two plus children the woman can take you to court and take 40%
(23:14) of your income it's not that every woman will it's that every woman can as soon as you enter into a marriage contract
(23:20) she has the now answer my question what did men ever get out of marriage what did men ever get out of marriage i don't
(23:25) really care about what they got in their question what did they ever get out of i don't care because i'm talking about i
(23:31) don't care if you don't care answer the question what did men ever get out of marriage i don't care like we have to
(23:38) operate for marriage we have to operate for marriage what does what does a guy what does a guy care about what happened
(23:44) a 100 years ago he cares about the decisions he has to make today yeah i know but you're just avoiding he has to
(23:49) use like a question avoiding machine so you want me you want me to do what you do which is prescribe i don't prescribe
(23:55) i'm not even asking for prescriptions i'm asking right now for a description what did men ever get out of marriage
(24:00) what yeah well i can think it's a stupid question so like but i don't think i don't think it i don't think it matters
(24:07) what did they ever get out of it ever i don't know tell me you don't know what they were telling they got the same
(24:13) thing i'm prescribing which is a family that's the what what else would the incentiv and again if if that's so great
(24:20) then men will sign up if that's so great if if a product's if
(24:26) a product's good there's a big demand right there is a big demand men want to get married sure then yeah but they
(24:34) wanted to they would right well we talk past each other is like if you you can if you describe all the issues that's fair right but the description of the
() 
(24:41) issue is supposed to be for the purpose of what men do best which is solving the issue i don't mind you giving all the descriptors i think that's great but the
(24:48) the idea of like andrew what do men get right now that's not a good enough reason what did men ever get out of it it's the same reason it must be the best
(24:55) reason then run for office run i mean i would much rather fund nos's so that i
(25:01) could get people in key positions to change law but i the same same principle but what i'm saying to you is like from
(25:06) a descriptive standpoint i am doing i have been doing it okay okay that i'm sure there'll be great change in the
(25:12) next 10 years well we're going to try and i'll be i'll be completely wrong yeah but i mean it the trends the trends
(25:18) can continue to nose dive but let's assume for a second that like it all nose dives what does the future look
(25:24) like then well i don't think there'll be change until my prediction is we'll only
(25:30) see change when society crumbles enough for women to face the consequences of their decisions and what happens then
(25:38) then there might be change that's what i would do i would i would predict that things go down until things are fall
(25:46) falling apart enough and then maybe there'll be a policy change maybe not probably not meaning we can
(25:53) fix the problems right uh not anytime soon no no but when we reach this like plateau
(25:59) sure so then wouldn't it logically follow then that we should accelerate the decline as quickly as possible to
(26:06) reach that plateau to fix these things sure if that's sure so then so then
(26:11) that's an accelerationist mindset right i i'm not saying one way or the other
(26:16) i'm saying i don't see them changing anytime soon that's it i don't yeah yeah
(26:22) i don't think i don't think in my lifetime they'll be major but ultimately do you want to see them change it would
(26:28) be nice yeah so so then if that if that's the case let's i'll just assume the position for a moment your position
(26:34) just descriptors here's where we're going mhm it would still be really wise to have men's rights advocacy groups and
(26:41) things like this in place for this inevitable decline so that those types of policies can then be pushed so that
(26:48) we're like ready for them right sure but the first one was in 1910 so i don't if
(26:53) if we're where we are today and the first one was over a hundred years ago the first what policy no the first men's
(27:00) right to advoc i think it was around 1910 i don't know the exact yeah but they were advocating for completely different things right um i mean i saw
(27:08) ones about divorce law early in the 1900s off the top of my head i i don't know but yeah yeah i mean divor used to
(27:17) be we had coverture laws so i mean coverture laws basically in that case you had to have show cause in order to
(27:23) get divorce and coverture laws things like that it was most of the early 1900s i believe so the thing is interesting
(27:30) though is like i look at my my point is i just don't see it being effective
(27:35) because the last hundred years it's gotten worse not better so why would i think okay go ahead yeah yeah but i mean
(27:41) ever so the thing is is like things have gotten better abortion laws have been rolled back
(27:48) right has gone up true only in some states though i went and checked the stats on that as well sex work has gone
(27:54) up too but you know what else is going down is uh female promiscuity and male promiscuity over time and what's
(28:00) interesting but std rates are up so how do you explain because sex work is up
(28:06) okay well if that's what you if that's not what the guys dating are saying but
(28:11) okay yeah because they're dating women who have only i mean you're talking about like one in 10 or one in 20 now
(28:16) can have an only fans the sex work epidemic has exploded stds i mean we can
(28:22) look at this objectively when the last time you dated like when's the last time you actually dated oh it's been [ __ ]
(28:28) i don't know like what 17 years or something how do you how do you think you know better than the guys dating
(28:34) like what's out there i mean when's the last time you dated like um a year ago
(28:39) okay so so from your so from your sample size you think that in 17 years the marketplace for dating has changed so
(28:46) much that i'm not allowed to have any input in it oh no i just don't think you really know what's on the ground um if
(28:51) you haven't done it in 17 years because it's ch the advent of social media has changed the dating marketplace a lot
(28:59) like a lot yeah why do you think wait a second back up i don't understand why you think that
(29:05) you couldn't have input and research the stat i'm using the same stats you're using like it's not and i have the same
(29:12) conversations with thousands of people you have men and women both um the the
(29:17) same exact the same amount of anecdotal evidence and statistics right sorry what i what i could say maybe a better way to
(29:23) say it is i think it's like an oversimplification of the problem when you're saying oh it's just like bad
(29:29) women that these guys are dating like i don't really think it's that that's not what i said at all or it's just sex
(29:37) worker it's just sex worker women that these guys are dating right no that's that would account for one thing stds
(29:43) the std rates going up yeah okay yeah so what i what isaiah gave you was the
(29:48) answer that you're always looking for that men get out of marriage the same thing they always got out of it a family
(29:56) and why is it that men are always gravitating towards family well it seems to be biologically hardwired in them because they've always done that sure it
(30:02) is so if that's the case their happiness levels intrinsically tied to that it
(30:08) seems that if you wanted to advocate for men then you would be advocating the most for the idea of keeping marriage uh
(30:15) sacradict and also making sure that these things got reformed as quick as possible
(30:21) okay if someone took your prescription what is your can you give me like step by step your prescription for how men if
(30:28) to get married stay married what's your prescription how should well first of all i wouldn't say you you keep on
(30:34) framing this as oh so i'm saying take a plunge when i'm not saying that's totally fine tell me your what's beginning to end so where should they
(30:40) where should they start i would look at i would look at these stats no not the stats where should they source the women
(30:45) from like what state should they go to what church i'm guessing you're going to say orthodox
(30:51) okay so i'll answer your question right you're not going to find huge variances
(30:57) state by state okay you're just not going to okay but you can you can definitely upgrade the chances of you
(31:04) finding a woman who's not going to have these behaviors which you and i would both consider nonoptimal so it wouldn't
(31:10) just be the orthodox church roman catholic church and even protestants as long as as long as the worship is more
(31:17) than one time per week right their marriage rates significantly go down if you get married as a virgin you almost
(31:23) never get a divorce because your sample size is super low um so are you saying they should they should find a virgin or
(31:30) do you expect do you think that's realistic nowadays to find a virgin woman yeah yeah no no
(31:36) no i'm giving you a step-by-step prescription of all the things you can do to mitigate risk no but i'm i'm not i'm not saying mitigate risk i'm saying
(31:42) do they download a dating app are they going to go on instagram how are they going to do it okay so
(31:50) yeah yeah so i'll i'll walk through it right but i'm what we're talking about is risk mitigation so let's start with
(31:56) risk mitigation your chances i want i want the dating process from beginning to end oh okay well give go ahead what
(32:03) you want me to give a dating process from beginning to end for every individual man on planet earth uh okay
(32:09) if a guy wants to go in your prescription no the dating process is going to be varied how is he going to
(32:15) source women on region it's going to be varied on man it's going to be varied on what options are what is this where is
() 
(32:21) he going to source women like what is this language it's so ridiculous but
(32:27) where is he going to source women source um thi this is why andrew laughed and i
(32:34) totally get it like like what kind of question is this give every man everywhere the step-by-step process like
(32:40) that's such a broad like it's not dating isn't that simple like you can't just go
(32:46) like like if you want to simplify it down possible you just go well you go meet a m woman where i don't know you
(32:53) could meet them anywhere yeah you could meet them on an app you could meet them at the grocery store you could go to a
(32:59) bar you can meet them through friends through friend groups you could go to parties meet a girl there like there's
(33:05) there's so many different ways because women are everywhere women are everywhere so you could meet them
(33:11) through several different ways there's not a specific there's not a virgin
(33:16) orthodox christian woman farm somewhere that you just go to source your women
(33:23) available but what you can look at is all the signs of the universals which mitigate risk what you're asking is for
(33:29) an absurdity it's like me asking "tell me step by step well tell me step by step girl how do i become a successful
(33:35) podcaster?" every man every woman on earth how do you become a successful i
(33:40) could do that pretty easily i could do no but i asked you first and you don't have an answer because you don't have an
(33:46) impossible question it's actually pragmatic because if you have a real pragmatic if you have a if you have a a
(33:52) real plan for men you have to have a step by step like what's step one yeah
(33:58) so step one would be looking at the mitigation for risk that would be step one you have to get a girl on a date
(34:03) first before you even get there no you don't have to get a girl on a date to mitigate risk bro okay well i guess
(34:09) there's no risk if you never get on the date yeah that's right so the thing is if you're talking about so walk away so walk away we're talking about many
(34:16) sourcing the women from asking for a stop cutting me off i need you if you're
(34:21) asking a question you got to let me answer the question you're not answering the question what's the question but
(34:26) then you have to not talk while i answer it okay i'll try i'm a woman so it's kind of tough okay go ahead stepby-step
(34:32) process how does he get a girl on a date where should get a girl on a date you would go online you'd have conversations
(34:39) with women everywhere that you went the various things that we've always done to get women on dates okay so you go on the
(34:44) dating apps and get women on dates no i didn't say that what did i say back what i said you said you said go online i
(34:51) assumed you dating apps and talk to them and talk to women totally fine yes are
(34:56) you ever going to get a woman are you ever going to get a woman on a date pearl if you don't talk to any of them okay so you talk to women in are you
(35:03) ever going to get a woman on a date if you don't talk to them okay so i want to keep going through the process i want to
(35:09) keep going through the process so you meet him on a dating app okay or you meet them i didn't say meet them on a
(35:14) dating app okay then can you tell me where yeah i would all you have to do to
(35:20) begin the initial so that's ridiculous well where do you meet these women you could meet them anywhere you could meet
() 
(35:27) women anywhere there's women everywhere like to to go to a specific spot like
(35:33) this is why it's such an absurd question and maybe pearl knows it's an absurd question and that's why she's asking it
(35:38) because she knows it's an impossible question answer like there is no one spot that you can meet a woman process
() 
(35:45) of dating women is use whatever connections resources you have to start
(35:50) connecting with various women you can use dating apps sure that seems to be one of the most common ways that you do
(35:56) it but you can also use friends of friends you can use your family members
(36:01) you can use all sorts of different ways to connect with women the same way that men and women have been connecting forever except now you have also the
(36:07) online component sure totally fine so then what's next do you take her on a date is that you can you can take her on
(36:13) a date but usually the second step would be to be in the talking phase and inside the talking phase you're able to
(36:19) actually identify many of these risk mitigating factors which become immediately apparent in 90% of the
(36:25) conversations they become they become uh very apparent the red flags or the risk mitigation i wouldn't take a woman on a
(36:32) date i would be in the talking phase with multiple women for an elongated period of time before i ever took one
(36:38) out on a date okay fine so how long should they talk before they get to the date well it's going to vary from person
(36:44) to person okay but what would you suggest i would suggest that you talk to them until you feel like you've gathered
(36:51) enough information and intel on the mitigation of these red flags and then i disagree with this a little bit i don't
() 
(36:56) think the talking phase in between the date is should be that long usually that's what the date is for the date is
(37:03) for is when you talk to each other and then you get to know each other you know usually you don't really spend too much
(37:09) time on the phone or texting talking to each other kind of wait for the date take them sure you could take them on a
(37:15) date then okay and what information are you trying to get from them well that's great glad that you asked that question
(37:21) for risk mitigation i'd be looking for things like were you raised by a single mom right what are your goals what are
(37:27) the structure in life that you're after whether or not it is the case you have a present father in your life how many
(37:33) tattoos do you have that would be another good one your promiscuity level i do a little intel maybe around their
(37:38) facebook things like this see how many male friends they have there's tons and tons okay the same things you know that women do yeah totally fine so now you
(37:45) get her on the date are you trying to sleep with her are you are you waiting till you're you're suggesting they wait
(37:51) till marriage is that what you're i well yeah only if they want the best outcomes yeah and they don't want to create single moms that they have to take care
(37:57) of their children yeah so if she's if she's not a virgin are you telling them they should still wait till marriage
(38:03) uh yeah i still would yeah okay if you're interested in a woman who's not a virgin right my assumption is the man's
(38:10) not going to be a virgin either 95% right yeah and most of the men aren't going to be virgins who are taking those
(38:16) women out either okay that's the case yes factually that is the dating market so you want men to pay a higher price
(38:22) for what other men got for free oh so okay well let's just grant this let's
(38:27) say they don't right you want men to sleep with a woman on the first date can you answer my question i'll answer yours
(38:33) okay so the answer's in the answer i i'll explain it so the thing is you
(38:38) don't like the answer you don't have to sleep with this woman to get to know her if you think that she's worth the risk
(38:45) and you think that she's worth it to you know stick around to sleep with later or
(38:50) to you know date long term sure the problem that you have here is that we operate no no no my turn if you we
(38:57) operate off of your logic right should they if a woman has ever slept with a
(39:02) man ever should no man ever wait to sleep with that woman i think should be
(39:09) that's a tough cell what's that you can sell that it's a tough cell so then you
() 
(39:15) think so listen i actually kind of agree with pearl on that and that it is a tough cell like you can't like if you're
(39:21) a woman and you've kind of hoed around in the past and then you want to settle down with a guy and then make him wait till marriage that is a tough cell
(39:28) realistically it is unfortunately though our society is kind of ruined kind of to
(39:34) this uh by this push of to secular more a secularist society and so yes
(39:40) unfortunately not only is it going to be harder to find a virgin nowadays at least that's like to virgin nowadays but
(39:48) so it is going to be harder to find virgins and it also going to be tough sell to men because we've been brought
(39:53) up into this society but that's why it's going to take work like this is going to take
(39:59) work that's why we got to get this message out there you know it's like we kind of have to do a reboot of society
(40:06) if you will but without rebooting it like we have to start pushing this messaging out now and start cherishing
(40:12) cherishing uh women's virginity again and that's why we have to fight to get
(40:18) this feminist messaging out of here where it's like it's a women's liberation if she wants to sleep around or not like no we have to teach why it's
(40:26) important to to be as pure as possible and give
(40:32) reasons why the woman if you've ever had sex as a woman you should just give it up
() 
(40:39) okay so you want guys to like answer the question i will answer that question no
(40:45) you're not answering the question you're avoiding i will answer that question if a woman's ever had sex every man she
(40:50) dates should she [ __ ] i will no i don't think so okay so then you're saying she should make him wait i don't
(40:56) i i think there's certain men you can treat special though and i think most men want to be treated special and not
(41:02) like other men so so is every man you've ever gone on a date with have you slept with him immediately
(41:09) um no how about how about you how about you no see the thing that irritates me
() 
(41:14) about pearl is it's that it's not that she's necessarily wrong with a lot of what she's saying like she's correct in
(41:20) a lot of what she's saying however because she offers no prescriptions for it it's mostly it's like she's just a
(41:26) black pillar just there's no hope so just give up pretty much or you know what there's no hope but you know what
(41:32) i'm not telling you what to do but just know there's no hope you're kind of [ __ ] if you get married so you know
(41:38) what just i'm not telling you not to get married if you still want to get married go right ahead but just know that you're
(41:45) [ __ ] if you get married you know she's so um pessimistic
(41:50) about it and what andrew is at least trying to do is trying to correct the ship the steering of the ship and trying
(41:57) to get back to things where they should be where pearl is just like "yeah well
(42:02) listen the the ship's going to crash into that iceberg over there anyway so why bother trying to turn it around why
(42:09) try bother trying to fix anything we're all going to sink anyway."
(42:14) and that's the thing that bothers me about pearl's rhetoric is that she is so doom and gloom and offers nothing to
(42:21) help society she only wants to to show you why it's torn apart but she doesn't
(42:27) want but she doesn't even believe that there's anything worth fixing because if she believed that there is anything
(42:32) worth fixing she would at least try to fix things sleep with any men no i what
() 
(42:38) was your dating experience like did you wait i mean if you want to go first of course i i like to get to know people
(42:44) things like this of course but the thing is is like that's my point my point is i don't want to go personal but if you're
(42:50) going you know what i mean no i'm not trying to be personal i'm trying to demonstrate a point of course you don't sleep with every man immediately that
(42:55) would be absurd that's not a personal attack but women do sleep with men faster that they like
(43:02) generally speaking i think the same thing with men they generally sleep with faster how would a guy know the
(43:08) difference between a girl that's using him for resources um or like just trying to use him for
(43:16) what for the lifelong provisioning or that actually likes him well every woman is going to be utilizing men to some
(43:23) degree for resources and historically always has the idea though that you can't mitigate these risks by taking a
(43:29) look at the entirety of their social media doing a little social stocking which is you're just looking around at
(43:35) their connections and things like this in order to see what the general trend is you can you can basically determine
(43:41) this fairly quickly in fact men have become so savvy to this in the dating market they're beginning the high rates
(43:46) of rejection now where they're like "nope there's no women there's no women that at all could mitigate any of this."
(43:55) i mean the biggest hoes that i knew in school had pretty much no digital footprint no social
(44:00) media none well i mean because they because they no because they it's like a strategy
(44:07) actually cuz they want to get like um they want to get around and it's really difficult now well then even the thing
() 
(44:14) is i looked it up pearl's like 28 years old so that means when she was in high school that would be like the early
(44:20) 2010s and back then social media i mean yeah social media was big but i think
(44:26) it's even bigger now where i think where i be back then you could kind of get
(44:31) away with uh not really having a bigger uh digital footprint um you know it
(44:37) wasn't as common then but nowadays i think it's kind of hard not
(44:42) to have some kind of digital footprint i mean unless you do strategize like maybe there are some women who are really
(44:48) careful but i think in general it's not that hard so it's like a small i would
() 
(44:54) just put that as another red flag oh you have no social media presence n maybe that's another red flag but wouldn't
(44:59) wouldn't you say that women are developing new strategies every like year to get around some of totally but
(45:06) don't you think that some of the men that you're suggesting this to are going to get got just balance of probabilities
(45:12) yeah it's a no matter what conditionals we make in society some men are going to get got there's nothing you can do about that ever doesn't matter if you had the
(45:19) perfect utopia some men are going to get got okay so what percent going through all these strategies what percent of men
(45:24) do you think will get got i think that you can lower the risk i think you can lower the risk mitigation down to
(45:30) somewhere around 15 to 20% which is what we see in these types of elongated christian marriages so you think about
(45:36) 20% of men will get got i think that all 20% of men have always gotten got and
(45:42) there why would a man take that deal uh because they want to have a family
(45:47) like they've always wanted to right but and do you think that if people stay married that's automatically a
(45:54) successful marriage if they just don't divorce no that wouldn't always meet the
(46:00) criteria for a successful marriage so but but hang on by the same logic you
(46:05) would have to agree then that not every time women want to get divorced it's unjustified true i agree so if that if
(46:11) that's the case then you have an equal wash there so the idea here is what do we want for a stabilized society which
(46:18) makes sense for men to have maximum happiness it seems to be marriage right but you're
(46:23) you're switching it back to what's in it for society and i i keep trying to stick to what's in it for the
(46:30) individ do you really think that a 20% failure rate where um a woman could
(46:37) potentially really ruin his life for 18 years like i mean i' i've talked to like
(46:42) um a good percentage what what failure rate's acceptable 1% uh i think one is
(46:47) too many when you have a quarter of when you have a quarter of when you have a quarter of men raising kids that aren't theirs utopian i think i think one time
(46:55) that happens is too many that's utopian that's literally utopian thinking so if there's ever a case that a man can get
(47:02) got then you would just recommend it's so silly that's utopianism that's
(47:07) impossible it's like saying no man should ever drive cars cuz they might get in a wreck it's like it's going to happen i wouldn't say that's the same
(47:14) because i would say a car wreck um it is not likely that you're going to
(47:19) be enslaved to that car for 18 years um and i think maybe well i mean yeah yeah you are if you
() 
(47:28) can't afford another car but she has such like a pessimistic view and it's like she wants to do
(47:34) everything she can to point out the negatives and everything she is so blackpilled and she is such a blackpillar that it's kind of sad to be
(47:41) honest like with the car analogy that that andrew brought up like that would be like trying to convince people yeah
(47:47) don't drive cars because you could get in a car accident because of this because of that well you don't want car
(47:53) payments do you imagine the insurance payments oh what happens if you get in a
(47:59) wreck what happens you could get a traffic ticket for disobeying the traffic laws
(48:06) you know and then you and then andrew comes along and tries to mitigate that saying "well maybe you should drive
(48:11) safer well maybe shop around for cheaper insurance well maybe do this maybe do
(48:18) that." and then and pearl's over here he's like "yeah but listen uh you know
(48:23) it's still dangerous it's still unsafe just don't you know listen i'm not telling you not to drive a car you could
(48:28) do whatever you want but it sucks cars suck." that's all i'm saying like andrew
(48:34) isn't denying the negatives uh that marriage is and he's not trying to tell people to dive in he's just trying
(48:42) to but he is trying to uh mitigate the risk and that's why it's important to
(48:47) teach men and women by the way you know i think in general like we live in a society where like there's a lot of
(48:54) factors in why the dating scene or why like relationship scene is like so messed up there's a lot of factors into
(49:00) it i think corn has ruined this generation where now we kind of see each we expect each other to act like porn
(49:06) stars especially men expect women to act like porn stars and do all these you
(49:12) know sex acts in the bedroom and stuff like that and i think women also uh
(49:17) sexualize themselves on social media and they try to portray themselves as porn stars in order to get these men uh women
(49:24) in in name of feminist liberation they're more easier to sleep with to men and now men on the flip side are
(49:31) expecting it from women where now if a woman if a woman doesn't want to sleep with a man right away well now the man
(49:37) understandably is going to think "hey does this girl really like me she slept with the freaking this dude the same
(49:43) night that he went on the uh she went on the date with him but now she wants to make me wait." that's pretty understandable stuff and on top of that
(49:50) too i think as a society we don't have really any values anymore are like that's why i also want to push christian
(49:57) values and ethics because that i also will think will help mitigate risk we
(50:02) also have a society of entitled people like our generation millennials especially are like our super entitled
(50:08) generation we look at more what can you do for us than what we could do for
(50:13) other people we think we should just be entitled to a good partner and so we're always looking at men or men are always
(50:19) looking at women well what can they provide for me and what can they do for me and this then creates like you know
(50:25) it's some this is a part of the reason why incelss are created but this is also why women also have a hard time finding
(50:32) a man is because they want men to check off all these checklists but they don't
(50:37) feel they have to check off any checklist in return you see that in these debates where these women they all think
(50:44) highly of themselves they all think they should be dating millionaires or you know the six foot tall uh six figures
(50:52) all these things and but then when you ask them about gender roles what are you going to provide for the man well they
(50:58) don't have an answer and fact they think it's oppressive it's also flipped things around where the gender roles are flipped around well not even necessarily
(51:04) flipped around is that we expect men to work but we also expect women to work too and so you're taking away their
(51:11) gender roles of what they could provide a man because as us as men we don't want uh successful ceos we want women that
(51:19) are going to you know take care of our household take care of us and be there for us but because women nowadays see that
(51:26) as oppressive you know that's gone out the window dating apps also too as i felt has made
(51:33) things really impersonal like really impersonal where you just accept a guy by swiping uh swiping right swiping
(51:41) left like the fact that andrew has to come on here and explain how to men how
(51:46) to date like that shows me how lost like this generation is personally i've
(51:53) always been a simple guy and with me personally i just always want a woman that i know who's going to take care of
(51:59) me who's going to love me and who's going to be there for me and also who i could grow old with i know that sounds
(52:06) cheesy but i always found it really um i always found it really beautiful when
(52:11) there's an old couple that are pretty much like old together you know spent 50
(52:17) years of marriage or however long and are there with each other till the very end till literally one of them's on
(52:22) their deathbed you know i think that's beautiful [ __ ] right there and that's always what i wanted for myself but in
(52:27) turn i also wanted to make sure that i could be a good husband and a good father and stuff in
(52:34) return i wasn't just thinking what can this person provide for me i was also
(52:39) thinking what could i provide for this person and i think that's the simplest way to look for get your morals in check
(52:46) get your values in check and look for someone that change that shares those same morals and values i'm lucky i found
(52:53) my wife me and my wife have been married for eight years going on nine years this year been together for 14 years total
(53:00) she wants the same things that i want she has the same values that i have and
(53:06) i also realize that i also have to put in work in this relationship i don't
(53:11) just sit here and expect her to put in work i also put in work and she is the
(53:18) exact same way and that's the simplest way that i could uh put it people but
