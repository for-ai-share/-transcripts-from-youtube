URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZlWZGf_sxg

(0:00) all right so Andrew so I was just talking Nina um like we agreed we're going to talk about gender uh abolition
(0:05) and gender roles so I think the let's just quickly go over the initial proposition I think the initial proposition should be like are gender
(0:12) roles good bad do they serve a purpose or do they not uh is it something that we should stick to or is it something we
(0:18) should remove something like that are you guys both okay with that sure yeah I don't I don't care it's
(0:25) uh it's her prop so what whatever her opening is it yeah it regardless of of
(0:31) that it's it's fine with me okay you know would you mind going first uh I mean no one's really the Challenger here
(0:38) since I was kind of set up this debate but uh I mean if you if you don't want to we can have Andrew go first but I
(0:44) think yeah I think it will make sense for you to go first so Andrew could understand your position better and then he can respond to
(0:51) it sure um there's a lot of interest intricacies of gender abolition that um
(0:57) I don't know um how much I feel need to be brought up necessarily but the main
(1:03) premise of it is generally the uh elimination of gender roles there's more complicated
(1:10) aspects of it as well that go into a lot of like very um theoretical um
(1:16) philosophical conversations which I imagine that's not very fun to talk about um but it's fun for me to talk
(1:23) about but okay what whatever you want I think I think your
(1:28) position but this this is opening thoughts like let her make her opening wait I didn't even know we were live I thought we were hasing out thought we
(1:35) were still hashing out what we were talking about I thought okay no it's fine we can hash it out before we get into that yeah I've been live so yeah
(1:42) you guys want just want to quickly establish this and then we'll get into it no no I'm good I'm sorry go go ahead I I didn't even realize I didn't even
(1:48) know we were live so no no apology sir um okay yeah continue
(1:54) okay um so what I find um appealing to
(2:00) gender abolition is the you know obviously the uh abolition of gender roles I think the the the phrasing of
(2:07) abolition doesn't do it any favors um as a like concept it's kind of like how people like like when you first see it
(2:13) you're like the police abolition like oh soers is going to be no you know all of that type of thing I don't I think it's
(2:19) a great phrasing so I don't want people to get wrapped up in in what that means um it's it's it's a you know a theory
(2:26) basically um that is just generally saying that gender roles are pretty
(2:32) Antiquated they're not really very necessary and I think they're actually at this point a hindrance and what I
(2:37) mean by that is that it's a hindrance to the point of I don't know why you know like you you would imagine that you'd
(2:43) want the the first the best person for the job to get said job um and there's
(2:49) no direct line that oh all of a sudden because it's in this particular role
(2:54) that is related to like you know your like you're if you're like a guy or whatever um that you're going to be
(3:00) better at those things when I think that the rigid aspects of gender roles like will kind of assume that which I think
(3:07) we could hopefully agree doesn't really make sense like if you're going to go into a job that's maybe like okay I'm
(3:14) doing construction maybe a guy would be better at that because of the physical aspect of it um but if we're going into
(3:20) a job like where most of our jobs are right now and in obviously like like white collar um or service industry
(3:27) we're we're not doing like strength based things we're using technology right there really isn't any reason to
(3:32) have any um differentiation when it comes to like careers um I think it's very tox um to change a little bit here
(3:39) when it comes to General RS I think it's incred incredibly toxic to say like oh guys can't be stay-at-home fathers
(3:46) because they're not men if they can't be stay-at-home fathers I think that is really like anti-man personally I think
(3:52) that that's really stupid and I think that it's harmful to both men and women to have these roles where you can't
(4:00) you can't do something that you want to do because you are you know either a man or a woman I think that that's like one
(4:06) of the worst things about gender roles is just that aspect where it's telling you what you can and you cannot do
(4:12) because you just are one thing and I think that that's Antiquated stupid and unhelpful
(4:20) and I don't understand how anyone could defend that okay Andrew
(4:30) yeah so I didn't I didn't actually hear an argument of any kind for anything not a not a single op I actually didn't even
(4:37) hear really a description for what is right just kind of like just this
(4:42) nebulous know I don't really think that you know like a construction worker should be barred from being a woman or a
(4:49) dude should be barred from being a stay-at-home dad which they're not no nobody's barred from that I'm not
(4:55) exactly sure what Nina's position is um I'm not really sure Nina has a position
(5:01) luckily I have a fantastic position so maybe Nina can like play off of that
(5:07) okay so for those of you who don't know I have a bit of a history with Nina so let me kind of explain to you what this
(5:13) history is it's my contention that nah and people like Nina suffer from a condition where microorganisms infect
(5:20) their brains called Noms these nids get in there and start making them say and
(5:26) do and assert ridiculous [ __ ] that nobody cares about and makes no sense in this particular case the Nina moids have
(5:33) gotten in there and have convinced Nina for reasons unbeknownst to me and
(5:38) anybody else who has any type of logic and reason or you know will of any kind
(5:45) um that men and women are equal which they're not equal there is no such thing
(5:51) as egalitarianism we've been over this before but when it comes to gender itself n tell you that she's a gender
(5:57) abolitionist right you first you have to you have to start with the Assumption the very weak assumption this logical
(6:03) chain first and foremost that there's a such thing as gender at all that it's not just some sort of complete societal
(6:10) construction that's limited based on whatever tribe you're a part of or whatever locality that you're a part of
(6:17) my contention very simply is that gender itself doesn't even exist that
(6:22) everything that Nina would consider to be a socially constructed gender role is actually a biologically grounded phase
(6:29) of sex and necessary for the perpetuation of human existence that's what I think but that's also because you
(6:37) know I'm a person who has some s sort of grounding in these things and have thought about them over and over again
(6:43) um so I'd like to hear like what an Nina's thoughts on transgenderism that would be uh a focus of gender for
(6:49) instance not just uh uh transgenderism but transracialism I'd like to hear
(6:55) Nina's take on that I'd like to hear Nina's take on gender right as it uh as it appears that she
(7:03) thinks it can just be changeable and malleable and it's not really related to sex so that's kind of where I'm at cool
(7:09) let me just give a quick statement so I'm G to be generally hands off during this moderation I will step in only in
(7:15) two situations number one where it's so much over talking no one can understand anyone I will allow for a good amount of
(7:21) like you know discourse and banter but if it gets to the point where no one can understand anyone I will step in or
(7:26) number two if I feel like the conversation is complet completely off the realse in which case I will try to redirect it but generally speaking you
(7:32) guys probably won't hear much from me during this debate all right guys floor is yours love nids again yeah the nids uh
(7:41) so so before the the nids become too overwhelming you have to begin to um dog
(7:47) mom drink them away with your wine cup what do you think that gender is
(7:52) Nina well you said it didn't exist I'm a little confused on what your stance on that is what I think gender is gender is
(7:58) a socially constructed um uh performance basically that
(8:04) uh is a display to go towards like a very like either feminine or
(8:10) masculine interpretation of yourself so it doesn't exist it's not a physical reality what
(8:16) do you mean does it exist is is a does a play exist you smell it taste it touch it can is does it actually exist or is
(8:24) it just something that is in our brains that we make up you can see it like what do you mean
(8:30) like where do you see it Define what you're saying about existing because it seems like you're being a
(8:35) little ironically NE nebulous about it no ironically I'm not being nebulous at all so I mean like the word gender
(8:42) obviously exists the phrase gender exists the theory of gender Theory exists so um like are you say
(8:49) like what are you trying to say exactly I'm trying to ask you if this thing exist is a physical reality or if it's
(8:56) simply an emotional manifestation or a human social construction meaning if all human
(9:03) social construction okay if it's a human social construction it doesn't exist in reality it's just made
(9:10) up I don't see that direct connection between that like that's like saying like um words don't exist because if
(9:16) humans weren't there there wouldn't be words words do exist that's such a okay because of what explain to me why
(9:23) because because of sound you have sound and interpreters which interpret the sound and so you have physical existence
(9:29) humans don't exist then you're kind of like giving me a if a tree falls in the wood would it make a sound argument here
(9:34) like that's justy try to let me try to help you out here right all I'm looking to establish
(9:41) from you because you are a gender abolitionist meaning you want to abolish gender just trying to establish if
(9:47) gender is real or if it's not real if it if it exists in tangible reality or if
(9:53) it's just some madeup [ __ ] that you're trying to abolish literally everything is made up we're
(9:59) talking about language so I think that we're kind of on this level right now and I think that not everything not
(10:05) everything is made up when we're talking about language what do you mean that's absurd makes no
(10:11) sense there's all kinds of things in language that isn't made up right that is a physical manifestation that you can
(10:18) look at but language itself is made up yes you can say that the process is a social construction that's fine so
(10:24) that's made up got it right so I'm just trying to figure out you want to abolish this thing is this thing real that you
(10:30) want to abolish to begin with Andrew just to quickly clarify your position for the chat you believe sex is real but
(10:36) gender is made up correct that's correct that's a biological reality and so what I think is that all these social
(10:42) behaviors that Nina thinks is relate are related to you're a man or you're a
(10:48) woman okay and that and and this these are genders so this is the way she perceives it she says if x amount of
(10:53) traits are masculine that's manly if x amount of traits are feminine um then
(10:59) that's that's womanly right this is this is the way that she perceives this so I'm saying that me clarify hang on let
(11:06) me clarify my position I'm almost done okay and then I'll pass the floor over to you what I'm saying specifically is
(11:11) that the way that human beings interact with their environment is directly associated with their sex so their sex
(11:19) and how they react with their environment is going to create the relationship of what you consider to be
(11:24) masculine or feminine be a necessity things like short hair wearing jewelry
(11:30) all of these things are actually manifestations that are NE uh NE uh
(11:35) Necessities for men in order to get along in whatever their environment is so you can say like short hair for a
(11:41) military haircut lack of jewelry because your hands get caught in things and etc etc etc there's almost always a
(11:47) practical explanation and application which is environmental which manifests itself as to why it is that these
(11:53) behaviors exist rather than the fact that it's just um well we we just made up these uh these social roles one day
(12:00) and we need to reverse engineer them so that now we're equal that's
(12:06) bizarre okay it's funny that you mentioned jewelry because that used to be a very masculine trait to wear a
(12:12) bunch of Jew jewelry so I feel like um a lot of like the history that we look back on traits of um both men and uh I
(12:21) guess like we're going to be like biological females biological whatever like what was considered of
(12:31) uh traditionally like uh biological females would you know wear dress biological whatever all like the dress
(12:38) the way that they'd act like all of those behaviors have changed like so many times throughout history that I
(12:44) find it very odd for you to say that like oh there isn't like a cultural sense of
(12:50) a gendered expectation to be one sort of way because it relates to your uh your I
(12:57) guess your uh uh you're suck sorry um and and you're
(13:02) going to tell me that like wearing jewelry is more what
(13:10) feminine like I I don't really know where you're depends on what the environmental setup was that caused that
(13:15) behavior to become integrated with masculine or feminine Behavior so you're then telling me that
(13:22) it's socially conditioned right because it has to have to do with your environment well it's not just socially
(13:29) conditioned I'm saying that there's a biological catalyst for it so well then why have things been the opposite
(13:35) throughout time like they have Jew us have been a very masculine thing to have
(13:40) a lot of jewelry yeah it could be that the environmental manifestation for this becoming something that's masculine is
(13:46) that jewelry was extremely rare and so for men to establish dominance over
(13:52) other men via wealth they would wear their actual wealth that could be one explanation for why that's a that's a
(13:58) man ation of environment with sex but it always if you look for a descriptor of
(14:04) why these things end up happening why we make these associations you can always Whittle it back to the biological sex of
(14:11) the person and people group engaging with material reality okay and the
(14:16) environment and those creating the social behaviors via necessity even right now that's the case via necessity
(14:23) what do you mean when you say via necessity so there was some there's some reason for it
(14:29) that uh is environmental and their biology intersects with the environment
(14:35) and that's the reason that these Behavior start why is there a biological reason to wear jewelry I just gave you
(14:41) the example I just gave what was my example that I just gave you need to repeat it back to me of why that how
(14:47) that could be the case uh that men would find it uh to be good to wear a lot of
(14:53) jewelry at certain points in history why would they think that as a possibility I assume because they just like like the
(14:59) way it looks well because they just wanted status symbol probably I don't know yeah status symbol right so so the
(15:05) biological human male behavior of being a dominant over one another one of the ways in which you can show your
(15:12) dominance is with displays of wealth so if you have a display of wealth in this case jewelry of course it would be
(15:18) considered masculine or maybe Stylistics or maybe clothing or all sorts of different Trends but all of it is
(15:25) dictated around the the biology of both the male and the female interacting with their environment so I'm saying that
(15:31) these aren't just characteristics of people who are who have like oh I think
(15:37) that pink is just pretty so we consider it feminine it's way more complex than that okay so it seems like you're just
(15:44) kind of going in a circle trying to weirdly like kind of agree with me that you're you are saying it's just socially
(15:50) conditioned then you understand what social conditioning means right well no it's not just socially
(15:57) conditioned it's it would be the opposite of just socially conditioned I'm saying that there's actually biological functions which make these
(16:05) social condition let me give you an example of how I know that that's true can you name a place on planet Earth
(16:11) where men or women predominantly act as the protectors and act as the physical
(16:16) arm and act as the strength of whatever the tribe or nation is and that this is
(16:22) purposeful have no idea what this has to do with jry can we stand well because what I'm saying is that anywhere
(16:27) anywhere on planet Earth there's a biological reality that there's a huge difference between men and women and one
(16:33) of those one of those huge differences is the interaction with environment is that men are far stronger so they almost
(16:39) always no not even almost always they always end up moving into those roles by necessity that's the way their biology
(16:46) interacts with the environment and why the social behavior begins to begin with
(16:52) okay so why would they were J R then I just gave you the example no
(16:59) but why did you relate that to the jewelry conversation we were just having I I don't understand your logic here like you're saying like oh because D
(17:06) biology interacts with environment is what actually creates what you consider
(17:12) gender that's why what do you mean by very specifically what do you mean when biology interacts with environment
(17:18) because that kind of just sounds like me that you're just literally describing like social conditioning I've already okay is is um
(17:26) is your sex socially conditioned Z no no it's not it's a biological
(17:33) reality right sure and the distinctions in these realities is that men have different hormones they have uh
(17:40) different even different brain archetypes different interests all sorts of different things that just by by
(17:47) itself the hormones on average between the do two uh create physical
(17:53) differences between the two to the point where uh it you know it's almost absurd
(17:58) to say otherwise right so if that's the case if just just off of the difference in chemical makeup between men and women
(18:06) they then have to operate with whatever their environment is their localized environment whether it's let's say the
(18:11) desert let's say the forest let's say the big the Great Planes wherever it is
(18:17) the the biological makeup of men and women are going to interact with those environments differently based on
(18:22) strength differentials interest differentials all these different types of things so the biological extension of
(18:28) engaging with their environment itself is going to create these naturally
(18:34) distinct roles but many of them become universalized there's a distinction in other words between men and women
(18:41) biologically okay you're going off in that tangent here my guy I gota it's not a tangent like I'm trying to explain it
(18:46) so a two-year-old would understand it right but then I
(18:53) mean it's very confusing as then again let's just keep with the jewelry conversation if we want to keep it simple I feel like that's the best way
(19:00) to go about it let's just stay focused on the jewelry example so why how would you explain with your or with um you
(19:06) know what you were saying about the biological relating to your your environment thing with the jewelry where there used to be a very uh male Centric
(19:14) thing to wear jewelry and or high heels or high heels could be example ex or any
(19:20) different number of Stylistics how how is that not social if its change with
(19:25) biological men now do not tend to do that because Ferraris didn't exist Nina
(19:31) because they displayed their wealth in a different way Nina obviously that's why because they they didn't
(19:38) have let me finish I'm trying to finish because they didn't they weren't able they weren't able to peacock with their
(19:45) Ferrari or their Lamborghini or their giant mansion or this type of thing but it's the same it was the same thing it's
(19:50) a demonstration of wealth for dominance or to attract the female or
(19:56) whatever okay so why why don't modern guys just I me like there is an as right but
(20:04) what okay so then why why aren't they wearing heels that well no what they do now is
(20:10) they get their legs broken they get their legs broken and then have their legs extended so that they appear taller
(20:17) instead of wearing heels they literally get their legs broken now Nina because of science because
(20:25) science let me finish you asked me a question you need let me finish the answer literally men will get their legs
(20:32) broken and then reconstructed so that they appear to be taller this was the
(20:38) same reason that it used to be style stylish for men to wear lifts they weren't directly high heels but they
(20:44) were lifted shoes so that they appeared taller wait but if there's status symbols if there's status
(20:51) symbols make any sense right cuz I assume the idea that the heels were a status symbol was because they were
(20:59) expensive to make that's could be one reason you're talking about the the breaking the legs the breaking the legs
(21:05) thing if you can't tell that you paid for that then how is that a size
(21:11) symbol okay listen I'm I'm saying that both and it could be both and so it
(21:16) could be that they want to appear taller could be that they want to appear taller so they wear boots for instance maybe
(21:22) lifted boots or lifted shoes or they have their legs broken to extend their height or they wear certain shoes which
(21:29) are completely nonfunctional in reality but are god- awful expensive uh and they
(21:35) want to wear those as a status symbol which uh which many men do that as well so all of it all of these different
(21:43) reasons in other words are extensions of the biological reality of men's behavior
(21:48) being different so to summarize this gender is a direct expression of biological sex interacting with
(21:57) environment I mean it really I don't really want to keep going on with circles in this but like you're
(22:04) really just literally describing like social factors here so um I think like
(22:10) you're kind of co- posting a little bit about the the the sex being related to it I'm sure things like have like a very
(22:16) small degree of uh relation depending on like your biology I guess but I mean
(22:23) which one do you think is more powerful like um what do you think about the
(22:29) whole um no because we kind of wanted to bring this up yeah that is true your audio is desynced by the way you might
(22:35) want to log out and log back in what's the isue her audio is
(22:41) desynced it it is it maybe that's on I mean Alex you're
(22:48) the ising it sounds fine for me no it's not it it doesn't it's not a sound issue she
(22:56) video and my I know I'm saying I don't it Chad here look straight look straight at the camera and say test one two3 so
(23:02) Alex can see for himself test one two three did you see that okay there's a little bit of a lag yeah it's minor but
(23:08) yeah if you want to log back in it's fine but it's not significant but it's up to you like you're just trying to say that
(23:14) to throw me off my game I mean I'll just I'll just do right in the M unnecessary for me to do anything to throw you off
(23:20) your game Nina it's completely unnecessary uh I mean the fact that I'm
(23:25) running it through OBS might be the reason why and I'm not going to fix that so it's as long as it's a it's fine it's
(23:31) not sign it's not significant okay yeah okay sorry where were we at Mr
(23:36) distracting you were about to ask me a question can you give me the contexts
(23:42) you're the one who distracted me the context for your question I have no idea
(23:47) what talking about previously my guy well I don't know my girl doing some
(23:53) like sneak I don't know I don't know what you're I don't know what your question was you guys were talking about
(24:01) you guys were talking about status symbols and how like back then they used to wear heels now they don't making the
(24:07) arguments because of technology I think you're GNA give some Counterpoint uh to that or ask him a question I don't know
(24:12) right I remember saying something about like not W to go in circles about this but as you collect your thoughts and
(24:18) find your next cup of wine I'll crack a beer here while uh while you figure out what it is that you wanted to ask me so
(24:25) one more time to State my position gender is a direct expression VI logical sex interacting with environment Oh I
(24:31) thought you said it didn't exist one more time what you're calling
(24:36) gender it's an internal critique gender yes it's an internal critique Nina okay
(24:42) but then it kind of tracks in some way because it seems like you're stating
(24:48) exactly what a socially conditioned thing is so I think we're kind of in agreement on this I guess we're just choosing to uh it's not socially
(24:55) conditioned one more time to repeat my position back no it's a social structure and not say it's socially conditioned I
(25:00) think it's a social structure it's just a social thing literally it's you reacting with your environment that's
(25:06) what a social thing is let me let me clarify this because I think I understand Andrew's position so Andrew is saying that your gender is always
(25:12) gonna be the same as your sex the whole concept of a gender social construct because you cannot have a different gender than your sex right it's the same
(25:18) thing gender really means sex right correct Andrew yes that's correct they're interchangeable terms literally
(25:24) interchangeable terms right and Nina I believe you don't believe that I believe you can have a difference between gender and sex and I believe that gender for
(25:30) example is something that's not necessarily 100% reliant on sex right so that's that's kind of the quux of it
(25:36) yeah it's an expression of yourself to uh relate to more like either feminine or um I mean obviously
(25:43) an gender abolition it it is kind of unironically a little bit in agreement with the fact that it doesn't exist
(25:50) you're kind of like going full C full circle on this where you actually align more with like the the more radical um
(25:57) theories of gender evolition that would actually agree with what you're saying um where it is just a bunch of like
(26:03) social relations between like um uh between your your sex and the way
(26:10) that you're perceived but I feel like what we're we're missing here um is the
(26:16) understanding of what modern versions of like gender is and the subtleties of um
(26:24) what it would look like gender abolition in the future would look like versus what it is now because I know you wanted to talk about like you know transness
(26:30) and stuff like that um and I think that it's really interesting conversation to have but I just want to make sure that
(26:36) you understand what I'm saying when I do say things like you're kind of going like full circle to being a little bit
(26:42) like of a gender abolitionist yourself where um to I can't abolish a thing which doesn't exist okay but you're
(26:49) using the words so the point is to change what it would that's because the word is the word is completely
(26:56) synonymous with the word sex it mean mean the same same exact thing when people in the modern times say the word
(27:01) gender they actually mean the word sex they've always meant it this way they have never meant it as a set value of
(27:08) behaviors between uh the two Sexes they've always meant it as just being
(27:13) sex so if you go back to the 90s and you play Boulders gate and it says select a gender it's asking you to select a sex
(27:19) it's not asking you to select a carefully assorted uh uh bunch of traits that you think are associated with a
(27:26) woman it's literally asking to pick a sex what me
(27:31) byend okay yeah no I mean like yeah Boulders gate very good uh factual
(27:37) statement or uh no all all everything everything you could possibly imagine for the word gender which is always
(27:44) always been used since its Inception by John money does your driver's license by John money has your driver's license
(27:51) doesn't ask you for gender it ask you for sex right so like an actual government
(27:57) yeah but John money up with the modern conceptualization of gender and when it was introduced out into the ethos and
(28:04) people began to use it they used it as a synonym for sex it was never used as a
(28:09) trait specific characterization for x amount of female behaviors or what we
(28:14) perceive as female behaviors in whatever Society you are makes you a woman that's insane and has never been the truth
(28:20) right you guys disagree about what gender is that's the part well yeah he's saying it is okay so
(28:27) you said you want to talk about gender roles then and if you're going to tell me that gender doesn't exist where are we at on that
(28:33) one sex roles you think that gender is a
(28:38) separate conceptualization of sex I do not if you're G to make the claim though
(28:45) that gender and sex is the same thing then we are in agreement and you could just concede the debate they didn't say
(28:51) that well then make an argument I asked you a question about what what are gender roles to you then well there's no told you there's no
(28:59) such thing there's just Sexes interacting with their environment there's male and female that's it that's it it's all there is okay so you just
(29:06) refuse to accept the idea that there are gender roles I talked to you before my guy like that's not what your position
(29:12) was like why don't you tell me what my position was before well you thought that gender rules were a good thing really why don't
(29:19) you point out any place I've ever said anything of the sort when we're especially gender roles is it's absurd
(29:25) on its face there's just there's biological sex there's nothing outside that there never has been
(29:32) anything outside of that anything that you consider to be this set value group of feminine or masculine traits is
(29:39) nothing more than an extension of your actual Baseline biology okay and you
(29:45) just make up a word in your head in order to accommodate like this small group of mentally ill people basically
(29:51) nothing else which is who in this case transgenders
(29:58) what does that have to do with gender roles well because they're trying to change your gender Nina they say that
(30:03) your gender is not based on your biological sex but whether it it's a construction do you understand what
(30:09) gender roles are gender roles have really nothing to do with trans people yeah I understand conceptually
(30:16) what you're saying a gender role is right I'm just telling you that it's not some sort of movement of pushed behavior
(30:25) um saying if you're a girl we expect you to act this way rather it's a set of
(30:31) environment it right so that's the now you're getting to the Crux of the disagreement rather it's a biological
(30:37) reality of your sex engaging with environment which creates conditions where you have to act in certain ways
(30:43) because to do otherwise would be in contrary to your own
(30:50) nature so you just think anyone that doesn't go with whatever I don't know sex roles you want to call it like okay
(30:57) so for example like if somebody doesn't want to have children or like doesn't want to take care of the children um you
(31:04) know or a a a a CIS woman doesn't want to take care of the children and wants
(31:10) to just work just just a woman you mean a CIS woman woman yes a sisw woman yes what makes her
(31:17) sis the fact that her um gender identity aligns with her um sex what does that
(31:23) mean your gender identity so if that's true then how do you perceive yourself what makes Alex
(31:29) white I don't know who that is the the guy who's hosting the debate what makes him white oh I didn't know your last
(31:35) name sorry his first name is Alex what are you what are you talk it's in bold
(31:41) it's in bold his name is in bold it's a ea you can't miss it how the [ __ ] am I
(31:46) gonna assume that I thought Alex Jones I'm gonna assume that
(31:52) it's Alex like him like what the talk what makes Alex the guy whose name is
(31:58) huh in a big bold letters a e x what makes him
(32:04) white what makes him white Nina Oh I thought you were saying his last name was white Jesus [ __ ] sorry that's not at
(32:11) all what we were talking about I I was not misunderstanding my bad I thought you said what makes Alex white and then
(32:18) just like stop talking um what makes him white like I what what the [ __ ] does that have to do
(32:24) with like your gender identity well because is it just an identity that he's white
(32:30) well I mean whiteness in itself is um more of a metric of like power like as we know obviously in the past like even
(32:37) like Germans weren't considered white back in the day stff hang on so can he change his
(32:43) him himself being white as an identity okay as I said that has nothing
(32:49) to do with what we're talking about when it comes to it does have ex wait so you think that race is same
(32:57) as sex that's what you're trying to argue right now 100% what you're trying to argue
(33:02) right now I'm saying that biologically if you think that white is not
(33:08) biological but rather a social construction and and gender is just a status of identity and has nothing to do
(33:15) with Biology then I need you to tell me if you can change your gender this
(33:21) socially constructed thing that we uh perceive women as can you change your race the same way
(33:29) in the same way as in how as in can Alex begin to identify as a black man and
(33:35) would it be true um I mean if you're going to talk about like if he's like related to the
(33:41) black community he can obviously have like a more of a a feeling of more belonging to that
(33:49) group of people but I don't like I don't know what you're trying to say with that like if we're talking about like
(33:55) identif can he get can he get affirmative action If he ident if he identifies as black let's
(34:01) say he's raised in the black community okay and he he has adopted the entirety
(34:07) of their culture and their norms and he he identifies as being black can he get
(34:12) affirmative action he has like humongus SW yeah can he get affirmative action
(34:17) Nina um I don't believe that is how that works no no no that's not how it works however in your mind this gender role
(34:24) switch you think that trans women should be consider actual biological let me finish meish I'm talking about reality
(34:32) here I you've been talking way more than I have come on point and I'll give it to you let me finish my point you know let
(34:39) me finish my point so how this is one for one analogous is you think that trans women should be afforded all the
(34:46) same rights as biological women so I want to know if you think that people who just identify as a different race
(34:53) should also be afforded the same status as that race rights I think everyone
(34:58) should have the same rights absolutely what the [ __ ] so women so hang on you think that women is a legit woman is
(35:04) legitimate protected class right um is it I don't know is it yeah
(35:09) yeah of course they have their own sports leagues they have their own sport prot own I don't think you know what a
(35:17) protected class is what is it Nina you're talking a protected class is something you could like uh you know
(35:22) like hate crimes yeah that that's what usually is considered under
(35:28) protective class laws yeah like Christian Christianity would be that would be a protected class race
(35:35) different races would be a protected class women would would operate under a protected class they're going to have
(35:40) different considerations for women when they apply for college when they apply for stem Fields when they apply for
(35:45) these different things they have their own forms of affirmative action for women they're a protected class I I'm
(35:50) asking you specifically is if Alex can change his race if race is socially constructed if it's a social construct
(35:57) protected class oh man okay fine Nina they're not a protected class uh either way can Alex
(36:06) change his race and get the same protection of class that blacks would
(36:13) have um I don't think you can change your race I don't know how that would go
(36:19) I don't think there's any mechanism for it you can I don't if you know this but on your um on your ID you can we're
(36:24) going to we're just talking like legal stuff right so if we're talking about like if you change your uh you can actually change your ID to say that
(36:31) you're you're female um and then you are um able to get certain like if we're talking about like grants that maybe
(36:37) like people can get from being like like tax breaks or whatever for being wom I don't necessarily agree with um
(36:45) affirmative action to begin with so I don't really know how much that you think that's gotcha but like I
(36:50) personally don't necessarily even have a very strong um feeling about that
(36:56) affirmative action is positive it's I'm I'm kind of on the fence about it personally well whether it's positive or not try to try try to understand why
(37:03) this is analogous because you're saying to me that gender is an idty no but you keep saying what I think and I and I
(37:09) don't think that because I don't really like you just said gender is an a form of
(37:15) identity yes self ID abely so it's self ID self ID is that like a how you
(37:22) identify yourself that's what gender is okay so how come race which is a form of
(37:27) social construction is also not interchangeable as a self
(37:33) ID because I don't think that people of different races um have any you know gen
(37:38) generally like intrinsic uh differences outside of cultural ones of
(37:43) course yeah so so then so then if that's true why couldn't you just identify as
(37:50) being that race because it makes you feel better and be treated as though you're that race I mean you could that'd be just I just don't know what the
(37:56) treatment would be different you if you wanted to identify as black
(38:01) what do you think the treatment so here's how your because you want to say the n- word or what like how would it how would it
(38:07) change it would be completely different you the things that you could qualify for uh from the state would be totally
(38:13) different affirmative action would be totally different all of these things would be totally different the same as if you I in your case you say if you
(38:20) identify as a woman you can go into Nina don't ask me a question and then two
(38:25) seconds into the answer you cut in just relax or second same thing as if a woman
(38:30) uh or a man decides he wants to go into women's locker rooms and self IDs as a man suddenly has the extended courtesy
(38:37) that he can just go and shower with women and this kind of thing okay so you're saying that hey none of that
(38:43) matters it's all just a conceptualization of self-identity it's like well obviously it's not just a
(38:49) conceptualization of self-identity because if that's the case then you'd have to bite the bullet on
(38:56) Race uh I don't feel like I'd have to do that cuz Okay so can get affirmative
(39:02) action if he walks around in blackface Nina can he get can he get affirmative action if he puts on black face and
(39:08) gives himself cornrow and says actually that's that's an interesting point to bring up because does Alex
(39:15) identify as black let's just let's play into what you're you're saying does he identify as black yeah but let's assume he
(39:23) did okay but does he no I'm sure he doesn't but who cares okay then so it
(39:28) doesn't really track US I identify as Asian actually okay but you sure I think
(39:34) that's what a lot of people like you guys like up a little bit with operating within the the world of he he is though
(39:40) he is for the sake of this hypothetical we're just going to assume that he is right but what I'm saying is like I
(39:47) think that there's a lot of subtlety there with if you're really going to talk about like it depends like I'm half I'm half Japanese and I'm half white
(39:54) like I could maybe identify more with one side I identify more with my white side like how do you feel about that
(40:03) like is that like something that doesn't track like consistently like a C Level it really matters that
(40:10) much her Point she when she when she says do you think X when she says do you
(40:17) think X that's a question right can you answer the question yeah so that both those things are pointing to biological
(40:23) structures right you are white and biological okay so do you think that
(40:28) people are significantly biologically different the same way that men and women are biologically different um of
(40:34) being different races I think that the significant standards are relevant that there if you're just going off of like a
(40:40) racial construction of certain clusters of people look very similar and therefore they're treated in certain ways due to the similar looking or
(40:47) whatever and this particular you're trying to relate that to you're trying to relate that to to race right I'm
(40:53) trying to just relate you're at with this just relating it to self idea so in this case you just self-identified as
(40:59) half Japanese half white you don't believe that these are intrin intrinsic biological categories but rather they
(41:05) social categories correct uh sure yeah okay so then if
(41:12) that's true and these these aren't biological categories are just completely made up Social constructions
(41:18) why can't you identify as black well I just I don't really know
(41:25) what the reason to this is why I'm saying like you need to know the reason behind it like I don't like if you grew up around like again like in a in a very
(41:31) black community you could identify with that particular group um significantly more but it's not going to change your
(41:36) skin color so like if we're talking about things like Element no no no if we're talking about things like like
(41:42) reparations or stuff like that um what we need to be addressing here is why were those things put in place why was
(41:48) affirmative action put in place it was not to directly like oh because your melanin level is a certain level that
(41:53) you just get this like um this Branch or whatever what we're really talking about is oh how were these people's ancestors
(42:00) treated right and I think that as we go on um this thing will not be as
(42:05) important as it is to to be racially divided in the ways that we are right now but um I think that what you're
(42:11) getting caught up on is like the these structures that already exist um for
(42:17) example like and again I I have mixed feelings on affirmative action and we can absolutely talk about that if um if
(42:22) you want to um uh assuming Alex is okay with that but I just I have very complicated uh opinions on that as well
(42:29) but I I I don't think that these this tracks directly oneon-one here when it
(42:35) comes to to to to sex and gender because I think that when we really talk about
(42:42) like race like what is being black mean what is being white mean like those then
(42:47) do become like a very socialized thing which I think you're trying to get at with this and that's fair um but I think
(42:53) that they the subtl you're trying to be very simplistic about oh you're all of a sudden going to be like oh he can just
(43:00) like say the NW like what is identifying as black mean right okay so that's I think that's
(43:07) a fair question kind of but let me just dive into it so that you understand right if you want to get into kind of
(43:13) these Nuance distinctions so let's start with is thing X possible okay so you
(43:21) would you agree that it's possible for Alex to put on blackface and identify as being a black man
(43:28) um it is possible for him to put on black face yes and pretend to be a black man right is identifying or pretending I
(43:36) I think those things are actually completely different okay fair enough so he can identify as then being a black man
(43:41) right sorry so he can identify as being a black man right um sure so the question is does
(43:50) that make him one does that make him a black person again that really is again when I'm
(43:57) talking about subtleties is what what black person
(44:02) uh who is very light is a light-skinned person um very like somebody who looks
(44:08) like Alex for example who is half black is that person still black I think that socially they would
(44:15) be considered black you sure you think socially that they would be considered black so the way that
(44:21) people would react to them was that they would just know that he was black yeah but I think that you have the case of
(44:27) Barack Obama to kind of fortify what I'm saying no I'm saying that he looked like Alex is Alex so now answer my question
(44:34) so now answer my question now that I've answered yours as you pivoted twice Alex if he puts on black face and identify as
(44:40) black you said he can do that my follow-up question is does it make him
(44:46) black okay but no this is what you're you're losing here okay answer the question what being is somebody
(44:56) looks not answer you did not answer my question if somebody like Alex so if
(45:01) somebody who looks like Alex is you know
(45:06) black or whatever is is so what what is your level of what is black is it just like the skin color is it the the uh the
(45:13) history like your like your ancestors like what do you think black is I think
(45:19) black is how we perceive a an a skin color of people who largely come from the subsaharan African region in the
(45:25) United States that's what we call would not be considered black because SK to
(45:30) you black just me SK who cares who cares I'm asking you that's incredible no no no no that's incredibly important so
(45:37) you're saying that black just means a skin color no he's not saying that okay
(45:43) he said he literally just said that means that you have a skin tone that is of subsaharan Africa when when you're
(45:48) when you're ready now now that I've just answered multiple more questions of yours can we go back to mine now did you
(45:55) just say that let me one more time I think that we associate black in the United States as individuals who you can
(46:03) largely identify as likely coming from the subsaharan African region just due
(46:08) to their physiological externalities so you would not consider Alex someone who looks like Alex who's
(46:16) like half black to be black then he's not half what are you talking about I'm
(46:21) saying if somebody looked like Alex mhm right yeah they probably wouldn't be considered black yes in in my framework
(46:28) or in socially uh in in Social framework of course not now back to my question
(46:34) now that I've asked now that I've answered all of yours one more time back to my question you agree that Alex can
(46:40) put on black face and identify as being black I'm gonna ask you again is does that make him black in Nina's worldview
(46:47) would that make him black if you're okay right that's why I wanted to establish this because in your view who cares
(46:54) about my view for the 300th time I've already explained it now you you're you're M wait why why does my
(47:00) opinion matter in this like what do you mean if if when you say black right you
(47:06) mean uh people who physically look black then no if Alex put on black face and
(47:14) said that he was black um it would really depend I guess on the quality of
(47:19) it like if you're if that's like your your primary level of like what is black like then on your uh assessment of that
(47:26) then I guess yes but that's because that's your all it is is skin tone Nina's
(47:33) worldview for the 300th time I just want an answer to you didn't ask me and I answered and
(47:39) I did ask you I've asked you six times I'm gonna ask you again if Alex goes in blackface if he puts on blackface and he
(47:46) says he's black is that a true statement or not in Nina's worldview that a true
(47:53) statement what do you mean by a true statement like again like you're just like being so nebulous and everything you're saying a true statement about what like like that he is all of a
(47:59) sudden black and your worldview yes in my world the melanin yeah because
(48:05) all you said was that it was melanin he's asking about your world view okay but then we have to establish
(48:12) the conversation of what like Blackness is and I think that's again a very tell
(48:17) what it is um that's an interesting uh conversation around that blackface is
(48:24) generally related to uh is is what I think about is like the minstral shows of making fun of an
(48:30) underclass so so
(48:36) why just as long as they're in the underclass whites can be blacks in or is there something hisorical I understand
(48:44) for example like when we're talking about like why are things like reparations a conversation why are things like affirmative action a
(48:49) conversation it is because of the uh historical injustices that have been made on histo uh uh historically like
(48:56) you know like we're talking about black like African origin um uh people um that were
(49:02) like slaved it really depends we're talkinging in America right in America we are very much talking about like
(49:08) people who had um Origins to like to slave ownership and then also like obviously the conversation about Jim
(49:14) Crow all of that like the injustices like things like affirmative act which again interesting conversation to have
(49:20) is related to um like making up for the wrongs that we had made in the past as a
(49:26) country like again as somebody who is Japanese the wrong that happened to
(49:32) my family that the country made up for was obviously the internment it doesn't
(49:37) mean that Japanese people coming in after the war would get like the reparations but the the systems that
(49:42) have been in implemented um at that time like uh with uh you know we're talking
(49:49) about like again affirmative action um when it has to relate to to like former
(49:54) uh like the indust that were happening with uh which is why I have such a
(50:00) complicated relationship with how I feel about affirmative action because I think that it's kind of
(50:06) gotten as a moderator no no don't step in Let Her Go trust me I'll bring it
(50:12) back around go ahead just bring it back around oh my God you love just cutting me off you I didn't cut you I didn't cut
(50:19) I want you guys to bring your back around because this is just now getting I'll bring it I'll bring it back around I promise let her finish all right go
(50:25) ahead sure okay okay um God damn it I [ __ ] get hate getting cut off
(50:30) whatever just do it you were talking about how Blackness is more of an less of an indication of skin color and uh
(50:37) the social perception and it's more of a shared lived experience based on a uh specific demographic experience in
(50:44) history that's where you were at a specific demographic experence no I'm
(50:49) say like the the anchest I was specifically talking about how that we were talking uh related to affirmative
(50:55) action as an aspect of like something that could be taken advantage of because I don't think that that necessarily is
(51:01) something that we can relate to gender because it's like so complicated in a way that um the history
(51:09) is like it's not the same as in like oh like what uh you you could say about
(51:16) like the history of like gender expression you know like there isn't like like white people weren't really
(51:22) like like Germans weren't considered white right for a while and then they were because what it represents is to an
(51:29) extent like a underclass um specifically when we're talking about
(51:35) America that's where a lot of that comes from like the one drop rule for example you know what that is
(51:40) right yeah get to get to your point like I'm trying trying to just wait for you to get to your point I've been very
(51:46) patiently waiting for you to get to your point okay right but my like entire point of when your question was related
(51:53) to like oh can he be can he like identify as black right um if he had
(52:00) like obviously like a historical relation to that Community even though he appears why that like yeah sure he he
(52:08) could but my problem is the blackace aspect where I don't understand
(52:13) why that would be a part of the uh racial identity like cuz because he
(52:20) wouldn't have to change his physical appearance right if he did identify with his black roots you you understand what
(52:26) I'm saying so if this is true and you're saying that these specific groups need
(52:33) to be isolated in order to get reparations how are we going to isolate the groups we would isolate them based
(52:40) on their physiology that's how we do it so if you want to know which group belongs in the camp whose ancestors were
(52:47) persecuted and enslaved there's a really easy tell for that and the easy tell for
(52:52) that is their biological externalities in your particular case you're saying if you want to apply for reparations or you
(52:59) want to have some type of group reparations uh for things that have happened in the past you have to have
(53:06) some type of biological claim to that group that's what you're saying I think that that's completely true and the same
(53:13) thing would apply with men and women when it came to transsexuality that you cannot adopt the
(53:20) identity of women as men because you do not have the required biological makeup
(53:26) that would put you in that group so that you could be extended those same courtesies so in other words you don't
(53:32) get to have the same type of Oppression Olympics as a man who dresses up like a woman as you do as a biological woman
(53:39) because you don't share the same history do you understand now you said oppression Olympics what
(53:45) does that I don't really think that made sense in the context of what you're talking about what I'm saying to you
(53:50) specifically is that if your claim is that you have to be a part biologically
(53:55) of a group in order to be isolated to be considered for these things like reparations then you're pointing at Alex
(54:02) and saying Alex simply putting on blackface wouldn't be enough because you'd have to share the history of struggle and the history of ancestry and
(54:09) all this other stuff okay fair enough then why would you extend the same courtesy to men who dress up as women
(54:15) and pretend that they share the same struggles that women shared have the same shared history as women have the
(54:21) same biological claim to Womanhood that's insane that doesn't make any sense holy
(54:27) [ __ ] like that's like saying like oh because like you have a like that we're
(54:33) talking about okay but I just don't even understand how you got that from what I
(54:38) was saying you're saying that like okay so what else can't he be black other than a shared history it's not like
(54:45) every single human being is like mixed race my guy every single human being is both part like of made from like a
(54:52) female or a male or you know obviously the interx that can be involved in that as well but like that's that doesn't
(54:59) make any sense of what you're trying to use that as perfect sense then tell me why Alex can't be
(55:06) black I don't know Alex black it's irrelevant let's assume for a
(55:11) second he identifies as being black identifies as being black are you going to say industry and maybe he like
(55:19) is white he might identify with being black that's my whole boy he doesn't he
(55:24) doesn't assuming he doesn't have any shared history no shared anything he doesn't have a single drop of biological
(55:31) DNA from let me finish he has not a single
(55:37) drop of this of blood from the subsaharan African region okay let's just say everything from Alex's family
(55:44) for the sake of this hypothetical comes from Scotland right doesn't matter where it comes from okay but he doesn't share
(55:51) any genealogy whatsoever with subsaharan Africans okay can you expl explain to me
(55:57) if he puts on black face and identifies as being black why he's not or can't
(56:05) you why he's not or can you um I see I mean like can he or can he not like yeah
(56:12) of course you can do that I just don't know why you would like what would the
(56:17) point of that be would he be black at that point black
(56:22) Yes again this is where I went into the definitions of that um what level of what level of
(56:30) consideration talking talking if black is genetic relations to
(56:35) that then no you're under your worldview nah not my
(56:41) worldview what under your worldview your Nina's World we're in Nina's worldview
(56:47) now I've already explained my worldview you can critique it all you want I'm fine with that but just answer my
(56:53) question answer my question from Nina's world viw from what nah thinks in Nina's [ __ ] brain if Alex puts on blackface
(57:01) and he claims that he's let black okay it doesn't make you black awesome put
(57:07) black face does not make you black yes okay so Alex if he identifies as being a black man and put on blackface would not
(57:14) be telling the truth right um that he identifies as it or
(57:21) that he like he is it that he is it is that he is that thing but that's why I'm
(57:28) saying that when it comes to like what's important of what your def okay let me just let me okay I'm going to clear this up because
(57:34) we've been going circles for half an hour okay the hypothetical that I think Andrew is trying to create is this let's say that I identify as black I have zero
(57:40) black ancestry zero anything like that I put on blackface I start dropping the end bumb I start applying for like
(57:46) affirmative action type of [ __ ] okay but why would you do that let's let's say I want to let's say I really want to be black and I just want to do it right and
(57:53) I identify and identify feel way more in in common with the Black Culture maybe I love rap maybe I
(57:59) love like everything about Black Culture right would that in your world viiew uh make me black and if not uh if I do say
(58:06) I'm black am I telling the truth or am I lying that's the question answer the question some you're
(58:14) list she can't answer the question and collapses her worldview Alex she it can't be it it it's going to be
(58:19) impossible I know you like to talk to get Nina to answer so just say yes or no nina yes or no I literally just said no
(58:26) no he can't be black so then he would be lying if he made the statement that he was that he's not black um that he was
(58:33) black um I would assume I guess sure
(58:39) okay so if that's true then we can apply this to gender now and tell me why it is
(58:44) that a man who's saying that they're a woman is telling the
(58:49) truth what do you mean are they saying that they are able like like that they're a biological female or are they
(58:55) saying that they're a woman a woman is biological female that's what people associate with woman okay but
(59:03) this is where we have the the gender conversation here yeah but this is this is exactly applicable to the
(59:08) conversation we just had before my contention is that they're lying they're lying because they can't they can't be
(59:15) those things based on both biology and the social makeup of who we would put
(59:20) inside of those groups due to their biological struggle under Nina's worldview so they can't be telling the
(59:25) truth know okay so what do you would you say that
(59:34) um if if you're so like upset about that phrasing for some reason of like thinking that uh women just means
(59:41) biological female what do you think of the the term transwoman well transwoman indicates men
(59:48) who have a mental illness called gender dysphoria
(59:57) the what okay like what do you mean so you're okay with uh the term transwoman
(1:00:03) if it's to describe if the descriptor of transwoman is not to describe a biological female but rather to describe
(1:00:10) males who have a mental illness uh which makes them just like
(1:00:16) want to pretend to be females then I'm fine I'm fine with using that terminology but the second you try to
(1:00:23) Interchange it and say that they're women they still be women no they wouldn't be women they'd be trans women so but right they'd be trans
(1:00:30) women that black women not women black okay so first of all you don't need the
(1:00:35) additional descriptor so black women are just women you're just woman all females
(1:00:41) are just woman trans women would indicate the people who do not have the biological functionality to be
(1:00:49) considered adult human females Des okay so just what about a
(1:00:56) [Music] um a firewoman mhm what's a firew
(1:01:03) woman like like a woman who's a firefighter yeah okay so if you were
(1:01:09) going to say um you know for the purpose of the conversation women who are
(1:01:14) biological females who are also firefighters we call them fire women I'm fine with
(1:01:20) that okay so you you are okay with the term then like trans women as long as the descriptor of it is
(1:01:27) describing this specific phenomenon of a mental illness called gender dysphoria I'm fine with it okay so you're just
(1:01:33) really married to the term the mental illness aspect of it you know what I think that's fine I think we'll take that from you that's that's as
(1:01:40) Progressive as I think we're ever going to get you um but I think that's actually interesting thing that you're
(1:01:45) willing to um engage in that I think but they're not women they're men but why do
(1:01:53) you call them women then I'm not calling them women you're calling you're you're calling them transwoman right I say the
(1:01:58) word trans if if if they make the delineation and transwoman becomes synonymous with man with mental illness
(1:02:05) male with mental illness instead of I am biological female I'm fine with that distinction
(1:02:13) yes transwoman is synonymous with male with mental illness do you think that transwoman then is synonymous with male
(1:02:20) with mental illness my personal definition of that um I I don't think that being trans mental illness this
(1:02:26) know but I think that that's okay that people can see it that way um if we're
(1:02:31) going to make you know some progress with that because I think there are elements of what is considered mental illness that we can go into whatever
(1:02:39) like having um I mean there there is a lot of subtle conversation about transness that like like non-binary
(1:02:44) people could also be considered you know trans so curious on it doesn't mean
(1:02:51) anything it's just made up made up tribe do everyone's yeah it means nothing it doesn't mean anything so maybe I should
(1:02:58) meaningless label it's a meaningless label would you be offended if I called you she yeah well that would be a false
(1:03:06) statement so it wouldn't be an indicator of Truth okay why because you when you say
(1:03:13) she you're referencing an adult human female as opposed to an adult human male which would be he the reason that those
(1:03:20) distinctions are made is so that we don't we don't make you would like being misgendered
(1:03:26) well it's not a misgendering it's it's more it's actually uh far simpler than
(1:03:32) that it's a descriptor which is inaccurate because it's a lie it's a
(1:03:38) it's a descriptor which is inaccurate because it's not indicating truth there's no truth that it's indicating so
(1:03:44) it would be inappropriate to use it it'd be like if I said Nina that guy that guy nah is super weird that guy's [ __ ]
(1:03:51) dumb right that makes no sense because the indication there is that you're male
(1:03:56) which isn't true it's obviously not true okay but as somebody who identifies as non binary I don't
(1:04:02) care you could absolutely say that but but the Nuance here where you [ __ ]
(1:04:07) yourself is you said that a simple as self-identification with an empty label
(1:04:13) isn't enough there has to be an indication of some sort of actual physical reality which goes in in with
(1:04:19) it otherwise you would be able well you actually had to concede that that's what the black question was about
(1:04:26) we're not talking about I know we're not talking about it directly but it's analogous across the board Nina so it
(1:04:32) would be inaccurate for me to say that and if you say I'm be because if you say that in that
(1:04:39) people group The the indication there that Alex can't be black is based on the
(1:04:44) fact that he doesn't have the requirements biologically nor socially to be black and so you don't have the
(1:04:51) requirements biologically or soci or socially to be a male you don't have those requirements so me calling you a
(1:04:58) descriptor indicating indicating your mail would be inaccurate how do you know
(1:05:03) I'm not a transwoman because you've publicly stated you're
(1:05:12) not together on that one yeah okay well G Nina do you have a
(1:05:20) penis does it matter what I say it matters one's a lie and one's the truth
(1:05:25) okay but well let me ask you this are you a liar uh sometimes sometimes you lie so
(1:05:33) should I even take anything you say should I take anything you say at face value are you gonna lie to doesn't matter like you're just do you just
(1:05:40) assume that I don't or what yeah we're able to make um societal
(1:05:45) assumptions based on just like we can make the the social assumption that Alex isn't black there's a reason for have
(1:05:51) you ever seen a really Butch lesbian I have yeah do you think that the fact that um a lot
(1:05:58) of like women get like or or a lot of Butch lesbians are get like harassed in
(1:06:03) women's bathrooms because they think they're trans women does that by a lot you mean almost none ever is that what
(1:06:10) you mean by a lot almost none ever if we're talking about like statistically yes a very small amount yeah very very very small amount okay but it doesn't it
(1:06:16) doesn't matter the point is that like it's indicative of the fact that you you probably can't really tell right there can be certain
(1:06:24) instances where magician's trick can trick the eye or where a person's eye
(1:06:29) can be tricked where they can't tell there can be instances of that yes but that really doesn't mean anything there
(1:06:36) could be an instance for instance where you had black men who did a movie called white girls and they dressed up like
(1:06:42) white girls for the purpose of this movie and the special effects were so realistic that it's possible that they
(1:06:48) were walking down the street and were treated like white girls it's possible because it happened that
(1:06:55) actually happened right it happened comedians were dressed upet
(1:07:00) women no I I am familiar with the movie Yes I
(1:07:06) just how do you not understand that the expression that we show of ourselves is
(1:07:12) indicative like when you like say she her he whatever like are you seeing
(1:07:18) their dicks or [ __ ] like when you say it like I I don't understand like how of course we make the of course we make the
(1:07:25) associate with that because it's biological men want to breed with women
(1:07:31) they no but are you on the street and you're just in like a store right and
(1:07:36) you're just like walking down the aisle here are you and you see somebody who
(1:07:42) like is presenting very very uh feminine like do you really
(1:07:49) know you can be tricked biological you you can be tricked the same way that a
(1:07:54) black person who who looks exactly like a white person because they put on all
(1:07:59) sorts of makeup and Hollywood special effects that can trick your eye but it's not an indication of Truth you think
(1:08:07) it's not indicating what's true yeah of I just gave you an example of that it's rare but so is the phenomenon you're
(1:08:13) talking about you're talking no you're talking about a movie my guy we're not talking about like what do you what do
(1:08:18) you mean who cares like the reason why that they're doing that in the movie is because they're filming a movie if
(1:08:24) somebody is a that they identify with and want to be perceived as a woman right so they want
(1:08:30) to present a nonr St they want to present a nonr statement to get you to
(1:08:36) trick your mind into believing there's something they're not just like those movie goers did just like the movie Producers did there's no difference
(1:08:42) There's no distinction okay how is how what did they get out of it let let me
(1:08:48) let let me they have mental illness they have a mental illness they don't you
(1:08:53) can't apply reason to people who are mentally ill because you don't have any reason to believe
(1:08:59) that you're just saying that they are mentally ill it seems like you're kind of mentally ill that you just think mentally ill the dsm5 calls people
(1:09:07) with gender dysphoria mentally ill not me it's considered a mental illness they're not like considered like needing
(1:09:13) to be that's right considered a mentally a mental illness yeah that can be treated with a gender affirming care
(1:09:19) right so lying to them lying to them that's the well so
(1:09:25) let's let's turn it around then if that's not you think somebody who has a mental illness the case let's find out if you're telling the truth or if I'm
(1:09:31) telling the truth if the DSM five put in a prescription saying that people who struggle with racial dysphoria let's say
(1:09:38) in this case Alex in blackface UT I don't I'm not I'm not dealing with
(1:09:44) this this talking and that the best treatment for him was for us to affirm
(1:09:51) his race even though it might upset everybody else in the black community should we do that um is it statistically
(1:09:58) going to lower the uh significant amount of like suicide rates
(1:10:03) absolutely oh I would consider it sure we'd have to know the facts on that you would consider affirming it even though
(1:10:09) it upset every black person on planet Earth who says you're the you're the one that gets
(1:10:15) upset about trans people I don't care about your opinion I want trans people to have [ __ ] Healthcare okay because it makes them feel better and it doesn't
(1:10:22) affect you well hang on in this face is that obviously has racial undertones do
(1:10:28) you think that that is the case when it comes to gender affirming care racial undertones do you think that the N word
(1:10:33) has the same effect of other slurs it has sex undertone so the thing is is that you want sex undertone so
(1:10:39) historical uh interpretation to explain it to you do you want so Christians are the
(1:10:46) overwhelming majority of the United States and you're asking them to lie in order to make people feel
(1:10:52) better but you would take you would take do you understand Christianity is a lie you would take black people's feelings
(1:10:59) into consideration religion is a matter religion is a [ __ ] lie dude whether you think it's a lie or not we're just
(1:11:05) operating off of feelings here they're not against uh against trans people people so I don't know what you're talking about so yes I mean yes they are
(1:11:12) but I don't know what you're talking about but anyway back back to what I was saying you would take the entire
(1:11:18) consideration of the black community into account and say it does actually more damage to affirm Alex's identity as
(1:11:24) a black man if it causes more harm to the entire black community but in the case of a Christian person you would say
(1:11:31) that's fine [ __ ] them they're Liars anyway um does it does do trans people
(1:11:37) affect the Christian Community yes I just told you we have to
(1:11:42) lie expectation is that we lie yeah that's very harmful to people there's
(1:11:48) it's harmful to people you think lying so you think Christians having to lie is the same as blackface the black
(1:11:55) Community I think that the ask that a person says something which is not true has the same ramifications on both
(1:12:02) communities yes because that's what you're doing in both cases okay so so yes just say yes that you you agree
(1:12:09) straight up that blackface is as bad as asking Christians to lie you know there's a lot of other things that 100%
(1:12:15) believe that that's true is that your same opinion on like abortion or some [ __ ] like that's insane no well just
(1:12:22) asserting that it's insane isn't an argument okay so why don't you um go in on that
(1:12:29) so why is asking to like let's assume that it's a lie or whatever so um how is
(1:12:37) lying the same level to Christians as Black Faces to the black community
(1:12:42) because both in both instances it's simply an emotional response based on something that's not true so they're black is blackface was
(1:12:50) like minstral shows and stuff like you understand what Minal shows are literally making fun
(1:12:56) do you understand in thist to we're talking about Alex pretending to be black and you affirming
(1:13:02) his Blackness you his Blackness you affirming his Blackness because it it
(1:13:09) will help him with like suicidality issues that's what we're talking about so if that's the case right you're
(1:13:15) saying it's okay to lie to Alex and affirm his identity as a Blackman in order to prevent him from from
(1:13:22) suicidality it's like okay that's fine if you say that and you'll disenfranchise every other black person
(1:13:28) who says no that actually hurts us right but you wouldn't give the same AFF foration to Christians who say we're not
(1:13:33) gonna lie and call men women who put on a wig and have a giant [ __ ] beard women that's
(1:13:39) insane I don't think that most uh trans women probably want to do that that's more of an NB thing again like I don't
(1:13:46) think you understand the aties of gend identity and that's fine
(1:13:51) that's for my understand you're talking about I just don't think like it's not like you're dumb or something I don't
(1:13:57) think you're a dumb person I just think that it's like more um like I think you're really like in the in the camp of
(1:14:03) wanting to make these things black and white and I think that's really un unhelpful opinion to have like just for
(1:14:09) yourself even like I mean you have multiple children what if one of them was trans would would you how would you feel about that they can't be trans it's
(1:14:16) an any they can only have a mental illness that's it there is no such thing
(1:14:22) mental illness okay so if the Sol Okay so they have a a mental illness right that makes them maybe vulnerable to like
(1:14:29) committing suicide right um and you had a solution to make sure that didn't
(1:14:34) happen would you not want to see that happen for your child I think that I would do whatever I could to mitigate
(1:14:43) their health not at the expense of whatever my personal values were so would I do anything the
(1:14:49) answer forance for instance if what if they were a psychopathic serial killer and it made them feel better to kill
(1:14:54) people okay but that's not what we talking about right but hang on should I let them do that the answer would be no
(1:15:00) because it would be a contradiction in values so if they said the only way that you can actually help your son through
(1:15:06) this mental illness is to affirm a lie in in contradiction to your own values would I do that the answer is also
(1:15:14) no okay so you're saying if you if if your child was trans and they were
(1:15:21) really upset that you would not accept if they had a mental illness no I'm just no I'm asking you like just a
(1:15:26) straight like okay if you think that that's mental illness that's fine let's go with that that's fine I don't see any problem with having any possible that
(1:15:33) was contrary to my Christian values yes child okay but what if statistically well there's not anything
(1:15:40) against in Christianity trans yeah lying is lying is bad in Christianity Nina I
(1:15:45) don't know if you knew that or not but we're not allowed to do that it's a sin okay I don't really want to engage with
(1:15:51) the lying aspect because I feel like that's very but you've already you already have okay so you so if you have
(1:15:56) the choice of affirming your Christian values and your kid killing yourself you're going to go with the kid killing yourself or
(1:16:02) themselves you mean if there was a direct like you have to violate the sanctity of all of your values where
(1:16:08) this kid dies depending on the mortality of the sin I just don't think that's not much of a okay so the mortality of the
(1:16:15) one of your kid lies like that's the that's you violating the sanctity of all of your values just like lying about
(1:16:21) anything yeah lying lying is a sin yes now there's a hierarchy when it comes to
(1:16:27) when it comes to not all sins are equal Nina so is it possible that I might is
(1:16:32) it possible that in my own selfishness I might set some of those sins aside for my Prodigy in order to do uh something
(1:16:40) different than is wi within my value structure even knowing that it's wrong I might I might do that but that mean it's
(1:16:47) right to do okay that's fair but you would you would be willing to do that if if the
(1:16:53) LIE cuz that I mean lying is not like on
(1:16:58) well yeah I think that the the magnit little lies all worse is worse uh often
(1:17:05) than just killing someone lies can enslave an entire population lies can convince people that men can be women
(1:17:12) lies Canin all sorts of madness Okay so in your mind how how
(1:17:18) high is the the trans life for you what level is it like the genocide like
(1:17:23) complete that's a complete rewrite of reality so it's it's a it's a socially controlled lie so it's it's high up
(1:17:31) there it's a it's a very awful and horrendous lie that has been perpetuated
(1:17:37) on the public to state that women the essence that is woman which is its own
(1:17:43) unique thing under God it's its own unique thing is perverse to the point
(1:17:50) where men can just make the claim that they're interchangeable with a thing that gives life to other men is a
(1:17:57) horrendous lie it's horrendous horrendous
(1:18:03) why I just told you why it's because it's a rewrite of the fabric of of all
(1:18:08) things that are true you're just kind of saying like Grand claims you're not really giving me an example howed off of
(1:18:15) my belief in Jesus Christ and my religion and the affirmation of that
(1:18:21) belief if you have if you have problems with that and you want to get into trans dentals and get worked there too Nina we
(1:18:27) can do that too whatever you want to do if you want to question my value structure compar religion something that
(1:18:32) doesn't have any basis in anything yeah I'm sure that I don't want to get religion let's keep it on topic okay so
(1:18:38) here on topic what I'm saying is that yes the affirmation of what's true is very important to Christians there are
(1:18:44) Christians who lie of course nobody is perfect okay and of course certain lies
(1:18:50) have a magnitude greater than others in their effect we're not [ __ ] we
(1:18:55) understand the distinctions here Nina what I'm saying is that if you if you make this radical claim that men and
(1:19:02) women are interchangeable that is such a wild claim that you need to present overwhelming evidence that that's true
(1:19:09) and all you have is that it's an empty label of a self ID which is [ __ ] pathetic it's pathetic do you think that
(1:19:16) all men are interchangeable of course no there's a separation between what makes me me and
(1:19:23) what makes Alex Alex okay so why did you say interchangeable in that context because you believe that
(1:19:29) men and women are interchangeable widgets and they're not they're not interchangeable widget you do like to
(1:19:34) say that I don't think I've ever even said the word widget I had to affirm it first debate I can give you the time stamp I'll have l pull it up right now
(1:19:41) and we can play live if you sure that's fine yeah but you did say sure your word
(1:19:46) choice doesn't mean that I go again or absolutely agree with everything you
(1:19:51) said it like you're kind of trying to do like a very weird Goa but what I get a little confused at when
(1:19:59) you're saying like I know we've had this conversation
(1:20:05) or I'm not sure if I had it with you but you know who Buck Angel is right I do I know another guy named Buck
(1:20:11) Angel gper but I won't get into that yeah go ahead go ahead you want to make
(1:20:16) like the The Buck Angel Blair white comparison right I still want to have
(1:20:21) that okay so if anyone doesn't know who B Angel is you can just go he's a very jacked man but to the Mind's
(1:20:29) Eye right like and like just seeing them on the street you're going to assume that he's a man because that's the
(1:20:35) utility of things like gender right where it doesn't really matter um what
(1:20:41) their sex is it's just how they're presenting um so what is
(1:20:46) your so you say you say Andrew if you saw Buck Angel graper would you or Buck Angel sorry not Buck Angel graper as
(1:20:53) funny as I I'm little worri if you think if you think uh Buck Angel right uh
(1:20:58) would I would I instantly assume that that's a man right the answer would be yes but so
(1:21:04) what my eye can be tricked just like a magician can so I'll give you a counter example if I pulled up right now hang on
(1:21:12) if I pulled up right now six pictures of Labrador retrievers could you tell me which of them were females and which of
(1:21:17) them were males I don't know maybe probably not
(1:21:23) could you do it like honestly could you just could you tell me which ones are males and which ones are female Labrador
(1:21:29) Retrievers uh certain dogs have like different aspects of it but for the reason of just not being annoying um as
(1:21:35) know no right you can't so the thing is is the reason that you can't is the same
(1:21:42) reason that my eye can be tricked at times it doesn't indicate I'm making a truth claim wait you're going to relate gender does mean I'm making a truth
(1:21:49) claim right doesn't mean that when I say that Buck Angel that I my per was
(1:21:55) tricked and I thought that that was a man that that actually is a man anymore than the labrador retriever right that
(1:22:02) you see it just like you just see their head or you just see their body or whatever you can assume hey that could
(1:22:07) be a male or a female you don't know relationally you can be tricked do you understand that like you your that your
(1:22:14) mind can be tricked but that that doesn't mean it's true okay but the fact that your mind is
(1:22:21) tricked does that not seem to make it seem that you know what general
(1:22:26) phenotype phenotypical characteristics are related to what you assume is a
(1:22:31) woman how it's being tricked just the same the same way that a person can make a quarter disappear or cut a person in
(1:22:37) half in front of you you understand intuitively that a saw cutting through a person would kill them so you're oo and
(1:22:44) odd when they pull the thing apart and this person is cut in half but they're not dead you call it witchcraft when
(1:22:50) you're like watching a magician like who gives a sh that it's a trick I mean you think is supposed to be like a I mean
(1:22:58) com make is Trick did you do you think that you of course it is makeup is
(1:23:04) designed to enhance seuality makeup is designed to en
(1:23:10) sexuality then why do you wear it do you think hiding like a it that's like really annoying prominent why do you
(1:23:17) wear it you think hiding a it that's like prominent is the same as like wanting to like get [ __ ] I'll tell you
(1:23:23) what I'll tell you what you know what if it's not about sexuality and how you're perceived by other people nah go take
(1:23:28) off your makeup and come back to the camera I'll wait why because you think I'm wearing because let's see what you
(1:23:34) really look like go go take off your makeup and sit back down you're not gonna bear then go do it I'll take take
(1:23:40) your time go do it okay but the reason I'm wearing makeup is not for that purpose why would what is the purpose
(1:23:46) why would I do that what is the purpose because I think it makes you look cool well you think that it makes you point
(1:23:52) like you wearing this you got a nice hair you got a nice shirt why the reason you're doing that are you trying to like hit on uh Alex here or what no men do
(1:23:59) things for socially different reasons than women do okay you no that I'm not wearing makeup I'm not wearing makeup
(1:24:06) right wait so are we talking about men wearing makeup or just women wearing makeup well women are the ones who wear
(1:24:12) makeup they're trying to hide their age they're trying to men wear makeup they're trying to enhance sex appeal
(1:24:17) things like that yeah sometimes they do it for similar reasons but overwhelmingly women do it for these
(1:24:23) purposes so go take off your makeup you're not you're not gonna be embarrassed it
(1:24:28) doesn't even matter Nita go take off your makeup I just don't want to do that I get up I have a thing I'm sure you I'm
(1:24:34) sure you don't I'm sure you don't but the thing is is that your dunk that like oh take off your makeup like I don't care no my dunk I'm not even wearing
(1:24:40) face I'm not even wearing that much makeup my guy like what the [ __ ] are you talking about as far as I concern you're wearing makeup my dunk is simple it's
(1:24:47) just to say that the indication of the things in which you point to are most often not true of the things in which
(1:24:52) point are often not true yeah that was like an absolute non streamid it was you're calling me a liar
(1:24:59) yeah yeah that's true you do like to do that only when you're not telling the
(1:25:04) truth only when you're not telling the truth okay okay oh I wonder how much gaslighting you do to Rachel my guy like
(1:25:11) it's a little worrisome do you get mad when she wears makeup outside no of course not I think I [ __ ] up my focus
(1:25:18) but she's just trying why because she would be honest in the statement that the reason that she's wearing it perhaps
(1:25:24) is to appear younger or to appear better or to have an appearance of a way that
(1:25:30) was to make a personification of a thing well when you're talking about sex appeal is very important for
(1:25:35) women okay but is that is to okay so she's wearing it for sex appeal I think
(1:25:41) sometimes sure especially for me and you're um okay what do you mean sometimes it kind of seems like it's an
(1:25:47) all or nothing there with the way you explain it well I don't think always it's being used for the purpose of sex appeal but I think it's always being
(1:25:53) used to hide some sort of reality yes um I'm okay with that I think it's
(1:26:00) fine like if you were going to hide a zit I might hide a zit I think that that's fine okay but I'm but the thing
(1:26:06) is is like all you have to do is make the indication of what's real that's all I'm asking you to do the reason I think
(1:26:12) you're a liar is because every time I point to a truth statement of something that's real your instant knee-jerk
(1:26:18) reaction is to tell me no actually you're wrong and this is and none of
(1:26:23) it's straight up gaslighting that you're doing right now like we're trying to be like oh well if you disagree with me
(1:26:28) that means you're lying like are you [ __ ] serious like with this right now no literally it's like I I just Reas
(1:26:35) think point out the LIE would you like me to point out the LIE uh so it's not sliding I I mean I
(1:26:41) pointed out multiple times that you saying things that weren't in were inconsistent is that really where you're at with one but you said that like
(1:26:47) literally the reason of going out was just like for or wearing makeup was just to be like sexually attracted I think it's one Reon you pivot
(1:26:54) one reason many Reas you said oh my God okay so back to back to the lies that
(1:27:00) you're telling though which are [ __ ] insane you say that it's not even directly analogous to to say that gender
(1:27:08) can be equated with transracialism even though it's the same exact concept you believe that race is socially
(1:27:13) constructed And yet when we apply this as a physical phenomenon to people you go into panic mode and you say no we
(1:27:21) need to have we need to have a shared history what
(1:27:27) phon you need to your to bro I'm trying what do you you tell me you tell me when
(1:27:32) it's okay for me to talk Nina go ahead you let me know when it's all right for
(1:27:37) me to point out your lie I just would like you to answer the what you meant by a physical phenomenon a physical phenomenon meaning
(1:27:44) a biological phenomenon there has to be a biological characteristic which ties you into this group if there's not you
(1:27:50) can't be a part of the group that's what you said I feel like you're just using a lot of
(1:27:57) terms interchangeably that I don't think are consistent with what you mean but if you want to continue two seconds give me two seconds
(1:28:05) because um he's too white I don't know um give me two seconds I really need to run the bathro give me
(1:28:11) one that weak bladder which is part of the phenotypical expression of women
(1:28:17) part of their biology that they can't get away from dude I don't know man I used to
(1:28:22) like like nowadays for last five years I [ __ ] wake up like five six times throughout the night to
(1:28:28) piss what's that nowadays like for the last five years I've been waking up like five six times throughout the night to
(1:28:34) take a piss well you probably drinking a lot of water I am drinking a lot of water it's probably because I'm black
(1:28:40) though that's probably uh that's probably it yeah that seems that seems [Laughter]
(1:28:47) fair yeah we we were stuck on the black thing for like 40 minutes I was like Jesus Christ like cuz I knew exactly
(1:28:54) what like analogy you're were trying to make I picked it up like the first time you said it but she knows she look nah
(1:29:00) understands she just that her worldview can't account for it so she you end up
(1:29:05) with all these red herrings trying to chase you down different obstacles it's very common very common when you're
(1:29:11) talking to leftists their worldview makes no [ __ ] sense the feminist worldview makes no sense none of these
(1:29:16) [ __ ] people make any sense um yeah yeah it's just true I don't know
(1:29:25) what else to say it's like that's a true statement so we'll wait for um we'll
(1:29:31) wait for Nina to come
(1:29:38) back I'm so sorry I needed a PE since we began and I should have done it beforehand my
(1:29:43) bad we're gonna call we're gonna call this the had to pee cope okay you can if you want I'm done I
(1:29:52) don't I don't think I don't know where else we could possibly go with this like you basically affirm my worldview Every
(1:29:57) Which Way it could be affirmed so I don't know what else to say really let me unless you want to say
(1:30:02) something you I'm gonna pose a question to both of you go ahead what is a
(1:30:10) woman um I I think a woman is just anyone that identifies as a woman that's
(1:30:17) an infinite regress you can't actually think that plenty of things you can what is a chair that's an infinite
(1:30:24) regress well a chair has an indication of trying to portray information so what information are you
(1:30:30) trying to psay by saying that anybody who identifies a couch or chair I think
(1:30:35) you could you could make kind of this broad description that uh any any
(1:30:40) particular thing that you in the case of a chair or any type of social descriptor
(1:30:46) has its limits but I think that the way we know what a chair is is by ruling out
(1:30:51) everything that's not a chair so the thing is is that this occurs with
(1:30:56) almost everything but what you're when you say a woman is anybody who identifies as a woman you're entering
(1:31:03) into an infinite regress because you're not giving us any description uh of what a woman actually
(1:31:09) is at that point so for instance if I said what's a Lakers fan you would say somebody that that's indicating somebody
(1:31:15) who watches their games and goes out and like you know or watches them on TV and knows the team and things like so it has
(1:31:22) some in information which is being pointed to with the description saying what information are you pointing to in
(1:31:29) your description of anybody's a woman who identifies as being a woman okay but if you're if using your
(1:31:37) argument about the the teams right if if the characteristic of somebody identifying as a a Lakers fan is that
(1:31:43) they you know have these certain social behaviors why could that not apply to
(1:31:49) somebody identifying as a woman doing those same social behaviors that we um relate to being a woman maybe it could
(1:31:56) but that's not what your definition that's not your definition your definition is anybody who identifies as a woman that you didn't say a woman
(1:32:04) somebody who dresses up like this or does this you just said anybody who identifies as that that's like saying
(1:32:10) what's a Lakers fan the definition no no no it's like saying what's a Lakers fan
(1:32:15) and somebody says anybody who identifies a Lakers fan right it's tological it
(1:32:20) makes no sense you're saying literally anybody who says this but you just described a lot of characteristics of
(1:32:26) people that are Lakers fans so I didn't just say somebody who identifies as a Lakers so who is a fan of
(1:32:33) sports uh who somebody how so the the information that you're indicating there
(1:32:38) are people who do XY and Z that's how you know that they're there's something there in other words so like if I say
(1:32:44) what is a chess player or a chess fan the the like definition the definition
(1:32:50) that I would yeah the definition that I would give is you know somebody who watches chess or somebody who plays chess or some do same thing so the
(1:32:58) broader concept of sports yeah the broader concept what does that mean it's an indication that they're playing
(1:33:04) sports or watching sports or doing something with sports so there would be some type of
(1:33:09) definition that was indicated they're not just identifying as that so if I were to say uh what is a sports fan you
(1:33:16) say anybody identifies as a sports fan gives me no information it's just an empty
(1:33:22) label but what do you what do you mean like we're talking about some who a fan of sports like which would indicate lab
(1:33:30) we still use it it still implies something doesn't not yes it does it indicates other information which is why
(1:33:36) you would not identify sports fan as anybody who identifies a sports fan you would identify it as like people who
(1:33:41) watch sports or play sports or do things with sports you would indicate information it wouldn't be an empty
(1:33:46) label an infinite regress would be you saying anybody who identifies a sports fan as a sports fan because then I would
(1:33:52) say well what's a sports fan and you would say anybody who identifies as one and on and on and on it becomes so
(1:33:58) topological in fact I can mathematically show it to you that it just is referencing itself over and over gives
(1:34:04) me no information right so you saying sports fan does the exact same thing but again like that example if you're saying
(1:34:11) who identifies as a woman and then like they dress like a woman they act like a woman they um behave like one they they
(1:34:18) do voice training to sound like a woman um is that not the exact same thing no I just explain to you well didn't didn't I
(1:34:25) just give you a descriptor of the difference between an empty label and a
(1:34:31) definition there's a difference between a definition and a descriptor okay so
(1:34:36) you having an empty label like for instance you say my name is Nina right
(1:34:42) well I can't give you a definition of Nas because it's an empty label it doesn't mean anything it's a
(1:34:49) self-identified empty label it means nothing it doesn't give me any information when I ask you what a woman
(1:34:56) is and you say a woman is anybody identifies a woman what information are
(1:35:02) you giving me about what a woman is what are you giving me what are you showing
(1:35:07) me what are you telling me there advice as a woman yeah right it's an infinite
(1:35:12) regress it it just it just continuously plays off that's where becomes the social aspect of what I mean that's
(1:35:18) where the main problem comes between the the sex and gender aspect of it to you it should mean
(1:35:24) or like a biological female right because you said to me a woman
(1:35:30) would be an adult human female okay so if a transwoman if woman
(1:35:36) is an adult human female then a transwoman is somebody who is an adult
(1:35:42) male an adult human female no and a transom is an adult human male with a mental illness okay but but woman to you
(1:35:50) means adult human female right yes right so if a trans the trans aspect being
(1:35:56) that they are um going from a male to female they can't that's a biological
(1:36:01) impossibility but you already no but you already accepted the fact that transwoman is a form of woman it's just
(1:36:08) different right but if we're going to talk about the phrase woman you have to you have to accept the fact that
(1:36:15) transwoman means a a person trying to go into the class of woman to your
(1:36:21) definition which is a bi is an impossibility right so it's it's a it's
(1:36:27) an impossibility So when you say matter but you're rela it does matter still have to accept that though that's like
(1:36:33) literally your logic not only do I not have to accept it but it's wrong what you're saying isre a fair phrase to use
(1:36:41) for what what did I say it's a fair a fair phrase to use for what phenomenon to describe trans people no to describe
(1:36:49) men males who are attempting to act like females due to mental illness okay so
(1:36:57) they are okay so you are literally agreeing with what I'm saying where you your definition of
(1:37:04) transwoman should still mean exactly as it as you said it was where it's um
(1:37:10) biological males that are um presenting as as yeah so there's information so
(1:37:16) there's information with the definition whereas in your definition of woman's and infinite regress there's no information there's no information in
(1:37:22) your definition none okay you're not giving me any information definition of that is to some extent I don't agree
(1:37:29) with your mental illness aspect but it's pretty consistent with mine so it seems to me that um gonna be like no it's not
(1:37:38) you don't have a definition except to say it's the thing you asked me what it is you're saying so if I say what's a
(1:37:44) rock you say well it's a rock what's the definition of a rock any anything that we think is a rock well what is a rock
(1:37:50) anything we think is a rock but a rock the thing what is that anything we think it is you see how [ __ ] stupid that is
(1:37:57) Nina I think you're try to run away from the fact that literally you confirmed that trans or women that's the dumbest
(1:38:03) thing I've ever heard in my life women are women so Nina one more time away
(1:38:08) from that if you say are you running away from that Nina no of course Nina I've already emphatically stated my
(1:38:15) definition of what a trans woman is okay so trans women or women we love that for you that's no they're not
(1:38:21) women the definition that does imply in no way that it's a woman because a woman's an adult human female adult
(1:38:28) human male would be the opposite of that you said like firew woman was still
(1:38:34) like a you know in your mind a uh adult biological female break just has another
(1:38:41) qualifier relating to it to occupation it's somebody has another qualifier
(1:38:47) relating to occupation actual so the qualifier for trans women are as you
(1:38:53) said um as much as I don't agree with the mental illness aspect of it that's fine but it they are biological
(1:38:59) males who want to perceive themselves as women or present themselves as women who
(1:39:05) are acting as women so so what's the distinction they're not women because to
(1:39:12) be a woman the qualia requires female so they can't behaving in like
(1:39:19) how so who cares if they behave like labradors are they Labradors okay so now answer my question if they
(1:39:26) behave as Labradors are they Labradors if they behave like lab that doesn't yeah are you
(1:39:33) saying furry like furries no I'm not saying FES I said they Labradors are
(1:39:40) they Labradors no they're furry Labradors I would assume no they're not Labradors
(1:39:45) just say no just say no just try not to lie for once in your life and say no they're not Labradors Andrew they're not
(1:39:51) I'm not lying do think that they're [ __ ] Labradors because they act like they're
(1:39:56) Labradors you can't ask me to just do yes or no questions you understand the fallacy that is
(1:40:02) you qualif do I have to ask you that when did you stop beating your wife question there were certain question you
(1:40:07) need ad the answer would be no I've never beaten my wife there you go no yes or no yes or no just answered no I've
(1:40:12) never beaten my wife no no no no you can't have the rest of that you just have to answer yes or no you yes or no
(1:40:19) you stop beating your wife do you understand why that that question that's called a loaded question but
(1:40:25) unless you can point out unless you can point out what question I'm asking you that's loaded unless you're unless you
(1:40:31) point out allowing me to do subtlety you're not allowing me to do subtlety with my answers I'm asking you to give
(1:40:37) me the yes or no unless you can point out what's loaded and then give me your qualifier after the yes or no no you were you were asking me literally just
(1:40:44) yes or no I I gave you my qualifier I said you're going to compare that to like the uh like if somebody's like
(1:40:51) identif as a uh or might be did you wake up this
(1:40:59) morning what did you wake up this morning yes why was that so hard to do
(1:41:06) it's almost like when there's not a loaded question question didn't involve subtlety my guy loaded it wasn't loaded
(1:41:12) none of the questions I've asked you are loaded you asked me a loaded question you asked me a loaded question so so
(1:41:18) since I'm not asking trying to give to you that you you're doing those things to me what's
(1:41:24) for a second you if you want to make the claim that he's asking you loaded question point out which question you felt tell me what's loaded about the
(1:41:29) question well the the labador question repeat it does it make you a labrador to act
(1:41:36) like a labrador doesn't make you a labrador yeah if that's a loaded question tell
(1:41:42) which is loaded yeah think it's I would just say no act like a laor but the point is that we're talking about
(1:41:47) language related to um if you're like a a furry who like
(1:41:53) identifies as a labador where you're a labador furry then yeah but that's not what I asked you I didn't ask you about
(1:41:59) a furry I asked you if you pretend to be a labrador are you a labrador Rex yeah are you a literal dog
(1:42:06) a literal dog no of course not right right so the descriptor here for when we say Labrador when we have a definition
(1:42:13) of Labrador you're talking about Behavior though that's where I'm I'm not just talking about behavior I'm saying that my definition of female has a
(1:42:20) biological element to it and so as a indicates something your definition doesn't indicate anything it's an empty
(1:42:26) LA right no exactly but like okay to to bring it back to the laborator um
(1:42:31) question if you behave like a lab nobody's going to necessarily assume
(1:42:37) that you are a literal dog but does some understand you could have be in the furry maybe I'm going to in the weeds
(1:42:43) with that one but like your behavior could still get across something that you're trying to
(1:42:49) get across right like I don't think everyone should just like identify as like FES or like
(1:42:55) like like that's like the same identification as like somebody who's like doing like their General identity but I'm just trying to use like the
(1:43:00) language the language is if somebody is behaving in a way they still might want to be identified as such in a particular
(1:43:08) environment it doesn't mean that necessarily like sorry go ahead no I so
(1:43:13) so there's some things here that I agree with but when we're talking about descriptors and definitions if you say
(1:43:18) to me Andrew what's the definition of a woman I say an adult human female then any qualia where you attribute woman
(1:43:26) from now on the qualia female has to be included right because it's a that's what it means adult human female so if
(1:43:32) you say fir woman it's going to indicate female every single time if you say uh
(1:43:37) you know [ __ ] I don't I don't I don't know what else whatever you put in as woman it's always going to make the indication of female because that's
(1:43:44) definitionally true definitionally true in your case you're saying a uh a woman
(1:43:50) is's anybody who identifies as a woman that doesn't give us a single bit of information as to what a woman is it's
(1:43:57) just an empty label in fact the trans Community has moved away from that because they know it's an empty
(1:44:05) label right I mean I don't disagree that there is a emptiness to the label like I
(1:44:12) don't care I didn't disagree with that at any point I'm just saying that if we're going to use the phrase
(1:44:17) transwoman the qualifier within that is where that becomes important
(1:44:23) where you're saying that it's the same right well I'm saying if you make the
(1:44:29) claim transom right necessarily you're trying to make the inclusivity of female in
(1:44:36) woman right but the term in this particular case means man who is trying
(1:44:42) to pretend to be female male trying to pretend to be female that would be
(1:44:48) transwoman my definition Okay so
(1:44:54) what's the problem with that like you're still saying the word transwoman so like what you don't add like the qualifier
(1:45:02) there like I don't understand like if you're using the phrase transwoman like yeah the the woman part maybe just
(1:45:08) doesn't really apply that severely I mean it does if we're talking about like trans Woman versus trans men but it's
(1:45:13) like it's more of like the the first part is the more important important part right you trans you
(1:45:21) mean yeah yeah I think that that would be the indication that there's something there
(1:45:28) that's not woman so it means something different than female okay yeah I I think that that you
(1:45:36) know again like that's actually pretty trans inclusive that I I I have no problem with that I think that's
(1:45:41) basically what most trans people think it's not what most trans people think it's not no they're very different
(1:45:46) positions oh of course yeah there's a lot of like discourse in there it's a new um you know conversation
(1:45:53) yeah if you'll concede that's true that we're indicating something that's not a female and you're willing to concede
(1:46:00) that I'm willing to conceed it to absolutely I don't think a transom is a biological female absolutely can never
(1:46:06) be can never be a biological female yeah yeah I don't was that even an argument
(1:46:13) well no I mean if it's just a descriptor of what is did you think that I thought fine with using that as a definition
(1:46:20) thought that trans women could be biological females but the real question is to go one step further can that
(1:46:25) biological woman ever actually be a man well it's the same question Just In
(1:46:31) Reverse not not in biological we're not talking biologic we're talking about like a man in terms of gender identity
(1:46:36) yeah but there's we already covered this right yeah you're just saying in Reverse
(1:46:42) I don't difference you guys are satisfied I'm cool uh we can do you guys
(1:46:48) have anything else you want to discuss before we get into closing thoughts uh yeah so I well I don't have
(1:46:54) anything I want to discuss short of closing thoughts no nina um I'm okay with moving on I think
(1:47:02) I don't have anything on top my head all right cool so let's get into our closing thoughts let's keep these like I don't know like a few minutes maybe not too
(1:47:08) long but yeah well uh Nina you open first so I'll
(1:47:13) I'll close first so you have the last word I think that's fair sounds good yeah so this is um this is an example of
(1:47:20) nids once again being inserted into a conversation where our um it's funny too
(1:47:26) I think da daa must be a dog Mom right that's the only way I can I can associate it right with the the
(1:47:32) consistent wine sipping as she does the debates it's like usually you would apply that to like a soccer mom but
(1:47:38) maybe in this case a dog mom um Nina has no idea what the [ __ ] she's talking about she never has any idea what she's
(1:47:44) talking about I don't dislike her as a person right just think that she needs to educate herself a bit more on some of
(1:47:51) these different um kind of different conversations that are going on in the
(1:47:56) political spheres this one's particularly important when we're talking about gender um it's a bad
(1:48:01) matchup all around uh nah is always welcome on the cruise ball I've always enjoyed having her on this kind of thing
(1:48:07) I'm just saying ultimately uh it's it's a bad pairing bad matchup because um
(1:48:13) honestly Nina's just not smart enough to debate with me it's not a really a dunk on Nina um it's uh it's just the way
(1:48:21) that it is in in side of this space there's only certain people who are even smart enough to step in the arena with me and she just happens to not be one of
(1:48:28) them so my suggestion in the future Nina is like maybe join the Discord get some
(1:48:33) great debate experience or something like this you honestly have no [ __ ] idea what you're talking about and you
(1:48:38) just kind of insert psycho Babble after psycho Babel and I have to untie all that [ __ ] before I can move it back to
(1:48:44) the point even though I feel like you know what the point is uh I'm okay with that I feel like that's just kind of
(1:48:50) traditional leftist discourse when it comes to the general indoctrination of people who are
(1:48:56) infected with these nids so um I'm the nids are real they do get inside of
(1:49:02) leftist women's heads I am the cure for the nomid uh you saw it happen in real
(1:49:08) time right now her worldview collapsed and she conceded to mine that's step one
(1:49:13) before you move on into replacing that worldview was something that's worth a [ __ ] so um this is what I would say uh
(1:49:22) needs to happen more and more and more and uh and that's why I'm always happy to have these conversations regardless
(1:49:29) of who it's with I'm always always happy to do that so I do appreciate you coming in and engaging Nina uh I'm just giving
(1:49:35) a descriptor of what is so I hope you don't take it too personally that's my closing statement
(1:49:43) all right n know fair enough it's good that you know the consistency of just doing odd
(1:49:48) personal attacks I don't really know how to apply I think you're right that I need to educate myself on things because
(1:49:53) I have a very positive view um and from California like of people's values where
(1:50:00) I think that they would be more interested in Freedom and I need to be educated on your opinion that is
(1:50:07) incredibly bigoted and because I I I am way too charitable and you're correct in
(1:50:13) that I do need to be educated with like how insane people are and how ridiculous
(1:50:18) your stance on wanting to you basically said that you were okay with with your child committing suicide because it
(1:50:24) would be a lie for you to um affirm them so um I think I'm okay with where I'm at
(1:50:30) with that um very interesting that you continue the personal ATT track of the nem moids I think that's like Mega cringe but you know if it goes off for
(1:50:36) you that's fine um I I am absolutely confused on your world position and I
(1:50:43) I'm grateful that I'm able to like have these conversations because I do I I agree I I do need to have them there
(1:50:49) people who have such like insanely different points of view for me because I think it is something that's incredibly helpful I do always love
(1:50:55) talking to you of course um but I don't understand why you're saying that my worldview collaps because I don't feel
(1:51:00) like that happened I think that we were just not understanding each other and that's why I think it's very valuable for us to have these conversations
(1:51:06) because you are just like in so much of a different mindset that I am and not necessarily that like uh that's either
(1:51:14) directly a good or bad thing obviously we talk about contentious topics but I just I don't understand the way that
(1:51:21) somebody like you and I think it's really helpful to understand that as well because I want to get better at being able to know how
(1:51:30) other people think because I am way too charitable and I think that you just are actually kind of a mean person um and
(1:51:37) you know that's fine I just need to get through my head that I should stop being so [ __ ] charitable with this type of [ __ ] are you GNA cry in general I think
(1:51:43) that are you gonna cry I interrupt you did I interrupt your I'm sorry my bad my bad wow seems like you're a little upset
(1:51:50) about it you know no I know that uh that's something that you think that left just
(1:51:55) get really upset about but I really don't give a [ __ ] like it's fine it's just interesting to me um I do think
(1:52:00) your background looks fantastic with the brick I would suggest using that more besides the green screen um and we love
(1:52:07) that for you but no I I'm totally down to talk anytime it's always a pleasure to be on the show and um yeah uh good to
(1:52:14) hear from you as always yeah I thought this was a really good discussion I personally understood both of your World
(1:52:20) Views uh really well I articul both of your arguments uh but yeah all right so let's get into uh super chats and then
(1:52:27) you can do yours Andrew if you have any super chats we can do yours to Nina and then let's do uh if you guys are cool
(1:52:33) with it open Panel I'll keep that one dude that you hate off and uh yeah let's uh get into it all right so let me do
(1:52:38) you can bring on uh you can bring on Grace Thorp she actually had a a quite the Redemption Arc the other night I was
(1:52:44) actually somebody sent me over a VA that that uh she was engaged with this uh
(1:52:50) with this chick and it was is actually quite good I suggest that everybody go watch that unraveling she did an
(1:52:56) excellent job and I was I was like actually shocked and it's going to make it into a trash talk Extravaganza she
(1:53:02) did such a good job so that was actually impressive um but Ben Thorp is still a [ __ ] douchebag and I have no use for
(1:53:08) him so but if if Grace wants to come on she absolutely redeemed herself with that one in my from my perspective for
(1:53:15) sure oh there we go all right Grace you are more than welcome come on uh okay let me get through these super chats hey

(1:55:16) gonna open up the panel we'll go for I don't know uh here's going to be the rules we're going to bring people on one at a time I
(1:55:23) am now a lot more careful after the incident with the channel getting taken down so I want you to turn your camera on uh you can turn on Backstage and just
(1:55:29) show me that you're real person and turn it off when you come on I'm okay with that uh but I do if I don't know you if
(1:55:35) I've never heard of you then I'm not going to feel comfortable bringing you on after that uh little uh porno gate on
(1:55:40) Greg's channel so yeah uh just you can turn okay there we go I got your traditional culture if you want to turn
(1:55:45) it on you're more than welcome to keep it on up to you I'm G bring you on oh sorry sorry buddy I didn't know you were
(1:55:50) turning it off how's it going dude we're muted my friend here we go yo my
(1:55:58) bad about that I didn't know you're planning on turning it off no that's all right I'm I've been I've shown my face
(1:56:05) before I can handle it I'm a big boy um my question actually um for Nina
(1:56:14) is um because I noce you said in your opening statement you were talking about like your views on gender rules and you
(1:56:19) don't like sort of the way that I guess traditional Western Society has handled
(1:56:25) the uh question of gender rules and I I get that you're not a big fan of
(1:56:30) patriarchy do you think that a matriarchal society would be better than a patriarchal society no no why not I
(1:56:37) think that one one uh gender being Superior over the other doesn't make any
(1:56:43) sense to me there obviously a gender abolitionist I just I don't think that it's logical to do something like that
(1:56:53) okay interesting um do you think that what sort of a society like how would
(1:57:00) you like to see Society be structured then um I don't really think that we
(1:57:05) have to go like severely different than what we kind of have here obviously I more on the Socialist side I want to see
(1:57:12) a lot like when we're talking about like Society I feel like I would be remiss to not mention obviously the um
(1:57:18) socioeconomic like uh aspects of that and I know that not what we want to get into so I don't want to get into that
(1:57:24) too much but what I would want in terms of just like General relations is kind of
(1:57:29) like similar to what we we've already been able to see kind of in like the gay
(1:57:34) community where there's a lot of like gay men gay women like by Men by women and like in those communities there's
(1:57:41) not a lot of um expectation and when it comes to
(1:57:46) something like you know obviously we're we're on um you know uh Alex's Channel I think that would be significantly
(1:57:54) more fair to both men and women where it would just be about you as an individual
(1:58:01) not if you're a woman or a man or whatever and you wouldn't have the pressures of being a guy and always happy to go be the one to go up if you
(1:58:07) don't want if you're not interested in that and being a girl that you have to play koi like all like getting rid of all of that [ __ ] so I just think
(1:58:13) everyone's going to [ __ ] way more if we uh get a less gender expectation why is why is everybody [ __ ] way more a good
(1:58:19) thing well that's just more of a joke but but um I'm just saying like if we're talking about like just I mean obviously
(1:58:25) as I know Alex's channel is generally based along like um you know the the
(1:58:31) pickup artist or whatever um I just think like in terms of it's actually how to be black that's the main folks of the
(1:58:38) channel oh [ __ ] well I'll have to change my answer on that one on uh on relationship Dynamics and I
(1:58:46) think a way more healthy way to have relationship Dynamics is to do away with
(1:58:51) the games that you have to play where you don't have to feel like you have to be a certain way you can just play it
(1:58:57) the way that you are as a person and you know um that should be equally as accepted and validated because there's a
(1:59:03) lot of people who also don't want to play the game either well what about if it were a
(1:59:09) different sort of uh program where like not necessarily saying because I I
(1:59:16) oddly enough to some extent I agree with certain aspects of what you're saying and that I I'm I'm a Critic of a lot of
(1:59:22) the way at Western society's traditionally done things I'm very harsh on my own
(1:59:28) Society um and I'm very interested in anthropology and looking at other societies the way other societies do
(1:59:33) things but what I see is that in many other societies many other sort of traditional cultures
(1:59:40) um you will see very different sorts of expectations very different sorts of
(1:59:46) ways that um men and women will interact will meet up you get some societies that are matriarchal etc etc but you will
(1:59:53) always see that there is some sort of social game it might be different from the one that we have it might be better
(1:59:59) than the one we have I think many in many cases it is but there is always some sort of social game it sounds to me
(2:00:05) like what you're sort of promoting is just extreme individuals and which I don't think is going to end up working
(2:00:10) in any society I understand what you're saying with that and I I'm unsure what you mean
(2:00:18) by extreme individualism but I I like for example like if I think that like
(2:00:26) being into Warhammer 40K you don't have to say like oh is that masculine or feminine or whatever you just like can
(2:00:31) do it or whatever and then like that's what your interest is so then you're going to find somebody probably that
(2:00:36) shares your interest where we're not like looking directly at the idea of like oh you have to find like this
(2:00:43) person that's like fills these check boxes to make because like other guys are going to want like it is in in a way
(2:00:50) very individualistic like you're saying where I think that's liberating where you can have the freedom to not feel
(2:00:59) like you have to find somebody or be somebody that checks a certain amount of boxes you can just be that person and
(2:01:05) find that person um because you have like whatever your similar interests or or you know like just a natural like uh
(2:01:13) uh situation with how you would like the same way You' meet a friend right like do you have to have a checklist to make
(2:01:18) a friend like I think that that's like a weird um disconnect that we have a lot of times is like oh they have to be like
(2:01:25) this they have to look like this like whatever like if you just have somebody you enjoyed being with and they're like you want to be with them I don't think
(2:01:30) that necessarily one would have to have that though so like for instance you know if I were to take an example of a
(2:01:37) culture like the Le people who live in h on island in southern China now they are
(2:01:42) a society that I like very much I I would argue that their courtship customs
(2:01:48) and their dating Customs if you could call it that are superior to s and they would actually be a model for the way
(2:01:55) that we should do things um and I won't I don't want to get into because it's too longwind I don't want to get into
(2:02:00) exactly what I mean right now but like the specifics about the culture but like the my point is that even though I would
(2:02:07) say that they still have you know Customs that a certain specific way of
(2:02:13) doing things and it's not oh you got to check some box or you got to do this is actually very relaxed and very informal
(2:02:19) as you're saying but it is it does still follow like certain rules and certain
(2:02:25) expectations because I think that humans as a group oriented species and we are group Orient species we're not just
(2:02:31) complete individualists the way the tigers or something are we're not solitary animals we do need to have these sort of social rules especially
(2:02:37) about something important like finding who your life partner is would would you not agree with that let's let Nina
(2:02:44) answer that and then we do have to move on to the next person unfortunately because we have people in line but go ahead yeah I I do want to ask a little
(2:02:50) bit of a followup if you don't mind really quick one so I don't I don't
(2:02:56) think that we need rules for relationships I think that's very close-minded opinion in my um my opinion
(2:03:04) um I I think that um you might be uh fetishizing a little bit about I
(2:03:12) don't I again I'm not familiar with that culture but I think that you probably are not like ingrained in it
(2:03:20) correct the culture sou I'm not a part of this culture I'm
(2:03:25) not one of them if that's what you mean right and I think that maybe it's a little bit of the have have you visited
(2:03:32) their Community like are you I'm not been there I I used to live in China
(2:03:38) though I used to live in China I have experienced dealing with like traditional Societies in China including
(2:03:45) both the Han Chinese and minority communities not that one specifically though okay um so I just I think that
(2:03:53) you're again a little bit of a I don't want to say fetishized because
(2:03:58) that always sounds really bad but the idea of like I think that having rules is not
(2:04:06) necessary and I think that's a lack of imagination on your end okay we do we have I think that this
(2:04:12) culture that's been around for thousands of years and is extremely adaptive and there are all sorts of metrics that show
(2:04:18) that's extremely adaptive and that every culture that exists now has been around for thousands of years all right guys we
(2:04:23) got we got we gotta I'm sorry I hate no it hasn't that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard in my life person
(2:04:30) uh traditional feel free to reach out to Nina privately you guys can set up a whole debate appreciate you coming on buddy yeah I can connect I can connect
(2:04:36) the two of you thanks Trad yeah for sure dude all right let's do a quick super chat we'll bring on Grace you know
(2:04:42) onethird of men haven't gotten lead last year do you think men could overthrow societ in a couple of decades and bring back the patriarchy because of feminism
(2:04:48) think about the French Revolution um I think someone asked this question last time Andrew was on but I don't believe you were on so yeah why don't you answer
(2:04:55) that question Nina I think me and Andrew have that's a little bit of a self-report that you're basically just
(2:05:00) kind of like doing like rape apology and I don't really understand why that's I don't think that's the point of the
(2:05:06) question at all he he's just talking about overthrow men okay but he started with one-third of men have not gotten
(2:05:12) laid so then they're going to overthrow and so what is what is adding the patriarch you're going to
(2:05:17) do that's that's his argument going to get [ __ ] more yes if we his argument
(2:05:22) is that if there's like Traditional Values right and there's a patriarchy right that more people like for example like 50 years ago more people were
(2:05:28) getting married right there's a lot less like hypergamy and stuff like that so yeah I think that's disapp Point yeah
(2:05:34) because women didn't have a choice so would you not consider that rape they still don't have a
(2:05:39) choice self report they didn't have a choice no they always had a choice just
(2:05:44) a cult what do you mean what do you mean it's a self-report it's a descriptor of what is if women don't have a choice who
(2:05:51) they [ __ ] and yeah they've never had a choice except the benevolence of what men gives them that's it that's the only
(2:05:57) choice that women have ever had Rachel Wear Yellow if you need help
(2:06:04) yeah do the blink twice thing next do the blink twice if you need help she's
(2:06:10) she's preoccupied baking me cookies it's terrible terrible thing I I prefer
(2:06:16) Eminem myself I don't know why maybe it's so with the one adolescent thing I have but I do like the Eminem cookies
(2:06:23) and she's upstairs baking away those Eminem cookies NE I'm sorry about your luck but the way that it is yeah of
(2:06:30) course I love that sounds pretty good all right let's bring on next person Grace all right I'm excited to see what
(2:06:36) happens Here Andrew I okay you buttered me up I came on to thank you for saying
(2:06:41) that my video is good and then you say women don't have a choice during sex what are you talking about well no I was
(2:06:47) addressing the Super Chat what did the Super Chat say grace no she said said you're saying that se no I'm not doing
(2:06:54) your word your games you to readu she said she said are you saying that women
(2:07:00) don't have a choice during sex and who they marry and you said they only have a choice that because men are benevolent
(2:07:05) enough to give them a choice we were responding to the Super Chat Grace do you remember what the Super Chat said or not outside of the Super Chat pull up
(2:07:13) the Super Chat she asked you a question about sex and you responded with that answer not about Super Chat yes it was
(2:07:19) the Super Chat was asking do you think that men could overthrow Society oh thank you by the way the &m cookies are
(2:07:26) [ __ ] delicious um the question which is asked here is whether or not men uh
(2:07:32) can overthrow the society and put back in a patriarchy at that point let's assume that they did Grace if they put
(2:07:39) in a patriarchy and they denied all access to rights to women which they could do do women have choice in who
(2:07:45) they have sex with then if men but but but men and women are symbiotic you can't have men no
(2:07:52) because men couldn't do that men couldn't have a society where they make all decis so then the answer would be no
(2:07:58) no no they couldn't they couldn't have a societ that no men are not like because men and women are symbiotic you can't
(2:08:04) have a society that only favors men and not women they are like you have to have
(2:08:09) both in agreement and harmony for society like so the Middle East has that
(2:08:15) yes Middle Eastern women Middle Eastern women are in in favor of Muslim Society
(2:08:22) they work with Muslim men they're not oppressed by those musim so you're saying that men cannot enslave women at
(2:08:28) their whims if they CH choose to do so I mean physically yes they can
(2:08:34) enslave some women but like not an entire Society you have this ridiculous idea that you can separate men and women
(2:08:39) and men can like why couldn't arbitrary rules that they impose on women why couldn't they Grace because men need
(2:08:47) women so they need women to agree with them but they they don't need them to agree they don't need them to do anything they're not the
(2:08:53) function how why have you ever have you ever had a woman disagree with you she's not going to just do whatever you say
(2:08:59) and you can't just so what so just BDSM everything is BDSM Grace unless men are
(2:09:05) acting on behalf of women to enforce their rights to not get raped or not get enslaved or not get whatever they don't
(2:09:12) have any rights they don't have anything external to men that's not they' never had anything external to men okay you
(2:09:18) say you're a Christian women have rights that are given to them from scriptor of what is Grace not saying
(2:09:24) what ought be this is just how it is all right get rid
(2:09:30) of oh come on he can't be here he can't sit here [ __ ] Cloud chasing I you know every time I give you a chance you
(2:09:37) [ __ ] this oh so Alex so so Andrew's in charge of your channel so Andrew's in charge of your
(2:09:42) channel he's not talking he's not talking he's a guest on my channel he has requested that he doesn't want to
(2:09:47) talk to Ben I have to respect that he not talking if you okay if you guest on my channel and you made the same request
(2:09:53) about look great tonight I just want to say that I hope that's not sexist yeah he sexually harasses all the time I
(2:10:00) don't want him on here Grace if you want to stay on you have to tell your dad not to be here come on any other time can't be this time well but this is this is
(2:10:06) what they do if you give an inch they try to take a mile that's why they end up serious question wait no hang on hang
(2:10:12) on stop I'm gonna mute you you have to make a choice okay there we go okay he's
(2:10:17) gone okay Nina I do have a serious question for you okay modern debate okay this is I thought we were back I thought
(2:10:23) we were back I thought you were ask we were talking about whether or not men you can't handle on you my guy I thought
(2:10:31) I thought that we were talking about if men could enforce rape culture or not and you were saying that they couldn't
(2:10:36) because they have to just have another have another bite of the Eminem cookie have another bite of the Eminem cookie
(2:10:41) I'm sure it'll sedate you for a little while question for Nina wait Nina this Friday modern day debate we
(2:10:47) need a woman who is anti-patriarchy to take anti patriarchy side I'm debating
(2:10:53) with John zurka for patriarchy we need a female streamer who can debate against the patriarchy do you want to do
(2:10:59) it John zerka my best friend um I think I might have to do
(2:11:04) something on Friday but if you message me on Discord I can you know um I just
(2:11:10) wanted to throw it out there because I'm looking for a female I'm down to do it I just don't know my schedule I guess is like the
(2:11:16) main point that I'm trying to say I just I I got to figure it out well okay
(2:11:22) what's your response to Andrew's thing do you think men can just enforce arbitrary rules on women whenever they please no men and women work together
(2:11:28) obviously men do not have some so you're like Jesse Lee Peterson you think men are inherently better than
(2:11:34) women that's what I said I didn't say anything about better I'm just giving a
(2:11:39) you think they in reality okay what's my position tell me what my position I'm not a feminist you're saying that men
(2:11:46) can enfor men can enforce whatever they want upon women that's not true it is
(2:11:51) true okay so can you tell Rachel to do whatever you want her to do and she'll listen no because men you're a man men
(2:11:57) men will protect her rights but if men decided not to protect their rights I could yeah okay so you can so so if you just
(2:12:05) decide out of nowhere to not protect her rights and nobody else knows about it you can just totally not protect her
(2:12:11) rights and you can she'll do what you say men is plural men is plural okay so how would you get her to do something
(2:12:16) that you want yes right collectively assult her or
(2:12:22) I don't even understand the [ __ ] question what are you asking collectively men cannot separate themselves from women and enforce
(2:12:28) arbitrary rules that they decide make sense on women where where show me a
(2:12:34) society where men and women the Middle East do live in harmony they live in harmony Muslim women are Muslim because
(2:12:40) they live in harmony because the men allow it and by the way you so I asked I
(2:12:46) asked you to give me an example of a society where men and women don't live in harmony you said the Middle East said they don't live in harmony you said well
(2:12:52) the only reason they live in harmony is because the men allow it a whole separate thing living in Harmon when you're ready when you're ready to to be
(2:12:58) quiet I'll qualify what my answer well right you just gave an example that wasn't an example then you back it
(2:13:04) wasn't listen it was an example and I'm going to qualify it so that you understand okay do you think that women
(2:13:10) in the Middle East would prefer to have more say in their lives or not uh no no
(2:13:16) I think many of them believe in Islam they believe their faith they do not want more say they believe in the Muslim
(2:13:21) culture they're they agree with it I agree now let's assume that collectively
(2:13:26) a bunch of them started to disagree and the men there said we don't care if you disagree you're going to do what we [ __ ] say [ __ ] what they do this this
(2:13:34) is this idea though this is this idea my question what could they do hear me out that women can have a problem with
(2:13:39) something in society that has nothing to do with men it it's symbiotic women don't have a problem that men don't have
(2:13:45) and vice versa so whatever the women would have a problem with would be equally affecting the men they would be
(2:13:51) talking about it would be a discussion it's not just that women and men are totally separate and that women can have
(2:13:56) private problems that they rebel against men and the men have to figure out how to deal with it it's har it's harmonic
(2:14:03) why couldn't they they could they could leave the Discord of this relationship and be tricked for instance they could
(2:14:09) be tricked by The Great Deceiver into wanting things that maybe aren't so good for them collectively men could then
(2:14:15) step in and they could crush crush in seconds whatever the up women wanted to
(2:14:20) do is that true or not true you're saying women can collectively be be seduced by Satan and
(2:14:27) that's not going to affect men that's going to affect both men and women whether it affects both of them all
(2:14:33) things will affect both but the guarantor of your rights and your actions are done by men including the
(2:14:39) guarant of where you're at right now when you live at home with your dad is that you live at the grace of a man and
(2:14:46) the truth is is that should men collectively decide that Grace no longer
(2:14:51) has Grace and they're no longer and they decide not to be benevolent anymore there's very little you could do or any
(2:14:57) woman could do collectively or not to stop that so you're saying might makes right so men have more physical I agree
(2:15:03) with you men have more physical power than women but essentially what it comes down to is that men have physical power more than women of course we all agree
(2:15:10) on that and so that's what life boils down to physical power that's not true and you're not a Christian if you believe that I'm not giving you an ought
(2:15:17) statement I'm not saying that it ought to be this way I'm saying you're saying is a descriptor of how it currently is
(2:15:24) what ought to be is a symbiosis which reflects the church that ought to be true that's not currently what we have
(2:15:31) either you're saying what it is is might makes right that is not true ultimately ultimately what it comes down to in the
(2:15:38) power dynamics between men and women is might yes might does in that case is not
(2:15:44) true that is society then give me the counter example okay you're saying that men just
(2:15:50) physically are more powerful than women we agree with that but you need women to literally procreate and you need capable
(2:15:56) women to take care of your children you need women to take care of if if you want to go caveman here you need women
(2:16:02) to take care of your children you need women to cook you need women to clean keep the household right so you need that woman to be on your side why
(2:16:08) couldn't you have slaves to do all that you so so slaves do great work slaves have a terrible work ethic how do you
(2:16:15) know monarchy pro slavery because if you're a slave if you're a slave you don't want to do what you're enslaver is
(2:16:20) tell telling you to do are you serious so what do you think that women are going would be able to do about that
(2:16:26) collectively if men decided to enslave them tomorrow Grace you couldn't do that
(2:16:31) you couldn't do that it's not possible why couldn't you do that how would you go about doing that Andrew you're just
(2:16:37) making an assertion and no you're making an assertion how how would they go about doing that done it they've done it you
(2:16:43) have societies especially in America in modern America how do
(2:16:50) answer the question you tell me okay so you're going to shut your
(2:16:55) [ __ ] traps so if you go back especially to's a big boy he's over compensating a little bit don't you
(2:17:01) think little bit well I'm done then when you guys are ready to let me talk what so you can give another
(2:17:07) example of something and then walk it back and say well that was how would they go about doing that
(2:17:13) you're just talking right but you're not listening let's let answer Andrew answer
(2:17:18) the question and then we can uh keep going all right go ahead well I'll answer the question but you have to say please first say please I'm not goingon
(2:17:25) to do it oh well then [ __ ] off I'm not answering your question Alex he wants you to beg him get on your knees and beg
(2:17:31) him you you girls if you want me if you want me to Beque unto you my expertise and knowledge say please if you're too
(2:17:38) much of a [ __ ] coward to answer the question because you don't have anything to say that's fine I've already answered it 15 times but you guys cut me off let
(2:17:44) move on all right all right he doesn't want to answer the question let's move on yeah say please say please first Alex
(2:17:50) how does your wife I feel about you flirting with other women on panels like this I mean I don't have a wife you're
(2:17:55) thinking of Andrew oh Andrew sorry uh name you're gonna beg women to say please answer yeah why don't you just
(2:18:01) answer the question now it's now it's now it's me begging you to say please that's an odd phraseology yeah you
(2:18:07) really want us to say you're still here you're still here you're still here I'm just saying you're the one who made it into a weird sex session not me how is
(2:18:14) it about sex because I asked you to say please it's called common courtesy say please
(2:18:21) out know she'll fix this [ __ ] you're not going to say please final decision Andrew are you
(2:18:26) going to answer the question or not no I there's no reason more to engage with this they won't listen it's pointless to
(2:18:33) listen to a person who won't listen to you I'm literally saying just just answer the question okay and then we
(2:18:38) stopped talking multiple times then don't [ __ ] interrupt me there have been Societies in which women have been
(2:18:43) second class citizens and enslave to the whims of men you can go back to ancient Greece and Rome to see such societies I
(2:18:49) can actually pull some of them up and absolutely they exist at the whims of
(2:18:55) men now in MO in modernity WR this [ __ ] second right now if men
(2:19:00) collectively decide that women don't have rights they won't have rights there's no argument that you can give me to the contrary if you have an argument
(2:19:07) to the contrary give it to me show tell me what it is well you're the one that's
(2:19:12) making that claim I think you're you're um have the burden of proof here
(2:19:17) how by physical Force what everyone's going to get into like fist fights with women like that doesn't
(2:19:24) make any sense they don't need to get into fist fights with women all they need to do is be Patriarchs inside of a
(2:19:29) society and determine women can't own property and are essentially all their rights come from their husband which
(2:19:35) traditionally has been what's been done in the past that your rights are established through your husband you
(2:19:41) couldn't have a bank account until the 70s for a reason you know it's because your rights came from your husband wait
(2:19:48) wait I'll agree with you on some on one thing I think both men and women need to be in agreement with how the society
(2:19:55) functions and if the society is chosen that women are subservient to men then
(2:20:00) okay both sides will work with that but have you ever like I don't think you've ever no both sides won't work with that
(2:20:05) because you can't operate in Reverse it's hard to just tell a kid to do something even if you have power over a
(2:20:10) kid it's hard to even just get a kid to do something you there there yes it is
(2:20:16) if a kid doesn't want to do something and you have power over them even if you try to convince them if you try to push them if you try to it's you cannot force
(2:20:24) people that's not a longlasting this doesn't happen you can't just men as a as a collective cannot just force women
(2:20:30) to do things tiring if it's literally just physical Brute Force no both sides need to be in harmony about it no they
(2:20:37) don't have to be in harmony why would have be Harmony because otherwise the men are going to get exhausted from
(2:20:42) being slave owners of these women constantly beating them physically constantly exerting Force exerting Force
(2:20:49) to get them to do anything that's how you're just you're saying this is a potential situation you talking sh as
(2:20:56) you go I want to comment on this I don't think that's true Grace because otherwise the South would have not
(2:21:01) fought that hard to keep slavery around I mean they were pretty determined so if it wasn't working well the South would have been like yeah sure let's end
(2:21:07) slavery so Andrew Andrew Andrew you couldn't get us to say please you couldn't get us to say
(2:21:13) please what you're you're you and the the rest of the men the big strong men in the world are going to get us to
(2:21:18) [ __ ] be your slaves you couldn't get us to say please on a live stream that's because there's other men who are around
(2:21:24) is that because you can't beat us up in real life is that because you're not here with Nina or me and you can't literally physically beat us up to get
(2:21:30) us to say please yes that's literally the
(2:21:36) truth it's descriptively it's descriptively true I'm really getting
(2:21:41) more and more worried about Rachel every time that you say anything just because I can engage in this with honesty and
(2:21:47) tell you what's descriptive truth doesn't mean I advocate that that's correct what part of this don't you
(2:21:52) understand what part of that don't you understand are you so [ __ ] stupid that you don't understand I can engage
(2:21:59) in your worldview and destroy it without holding it you're you're literally making the point you would have to
(2:22:05) convince us that we should say please to you okay you tried your your daddy thing you tried saying just say please say
(2:22:11) please and we didn't do it you tried being forceful right it didn't work neither of us did it right so you're
(2:22:17) saying that's going to work collectively you couldn't even make it happen you couldn't even
(2:22:22) collectively no just gave the demonstration of how it doesn't work if every guy got together demonstration of
(2:22:29) how it doesn't work you have men enforcing your rights right now Grace you [ __ ] tart you stupid tart write
(2:22:35) this second men enforcing my rights yes right now right this second currently and women are both enforcing just men
(2:22:42) just men women can't men just men just men just men they're the enforcers of
(2:22:48) right just men because men are physically strong yes it's really that simple it's really that simple an
(2:22:54) absolute cope for you that because you just feel like you're like don't have a lot of power that like your C post is
(2:23:00) just to say that because you're like strong literally anytime you work anytime
(2:23:06) youate you'll get destroyed like every feminist has come before you there is no argument to this yeah you definitely
(2:23:13) don't seem a little insecure cannot make make the claim that you have inherent
(2:23:18) rights when you have to beg men for them you don't have inherent rights you get your right men you get your rights from
(2:23:25) men Yes Men give other men rights men give other men rights oh so you would say the same thing to black people that
(2:23:30) all men give other men rights yes and women rights as well yes okay so you don't have any rights without other men
(2:23:36) okay so men give so men give other men and women rights yes that's correct interesting so do women have god-given
(2:23:43) rights or not Andrew um it depends on how you're
(2:23:48) affording rights what do you mean do women have god-given rights you are a
(2:23:53) Christian you're a Christian do women have god-given rights what's a god-given
(2:23:59) right well you're a Christian you should know [ __ ] I'm asking you it's your worldview you're Christian a right that
(2:24:05) comes it comes from God and it is inherent you cannot that right cannot be taken away by Society it can be you can
(2:24:12) I think I think I could be convinced of that if god-given Rights was framed in the proper Dynamic I could be you don't
(2:24:19) think women have god-given rights like the right to life the right to dignity I
(2:24:24) think that they probably have the right well they may have some god-given rights I'm not sure it depends on how you frame
(2:24:30) rights so you don't think women so do men have god-given rights do men have god-given rights it is tell me what a
(2:24:37) god-given right is maybe I'll agree with you it's a right given to you by God that cannot be taken away from you one name one okay the right to life the
(2:24:43) right to dignity you don't have a right to life from God God God allows women to die constantly okay no I'm not saying
(2:24:49) that you don't die but I'm saying the right to life to from God then you [ __ ] idiot well how about the right
(2:24:55) to dignity the right to dignity for what no I don't think you have a right to digity are you talking about legal
(2:25:01) rights to not be dignified all the time what are these God right it's a right no I'm not saying you don't understand a
(2:25:07) god-given right doesn't mean you have that all the time it doesn't mean people can't disrespect those rights but it's god-given it's not given by man it's
(2:25:13) given by God are you asking if these are unalienable rights from God the answer would be no you don't have the right to
(2:25:18) not die you don't have the right right to not be uh undignified but from God that doesn't seem it's not about whether
(2:25:24) you're no rights are not about whether you're allowed to do something or not rights are about whether you are owed
(2:25:30) this you owed this we can easily clarify this he's not talking about what ought
(2:25:36) be he's talking about what actually is there are no rights that you don't need
(2:25:41) to appeal to men to enforce so if someone's violating a right you think you have who do you go to to enforce
(2:25:49) your rights the police the military the government all men you don't go to a woman and say this man is violating my
(2:25:56) right military but but you're just saying okay but those okay but those are
(2:26:01) rights that are like enforced physically okay and you can say everything boils down to physical that's not true that's
(2:26:07) not true wom wom protect women protect children's rights women protect children's rights and Men
(2:26:14) protect so do children so do children not have god-given rights only women have the rights do children have
(2:26:21) god-given rights Grace Can't Stop sping for long enough to listen okay there we
(2:26:27) go wait let me let me present a little bit of a different more nuanced point I was actually thinking about this after
(2:26:32) the first time you had this debate Andrew and I came up with I hey Alex can I just posit one question for them that
(2:26:38) I think will finally clear up this stupid [ __ ] once and for all good to see you Rachel if the if the power grid goes
(2:26:45) down tomorrow if there's a massive EMP there's a massive uh you know Comet that
(2:26:50) hits and the power grid goes out tomorrow what who do you think is going
(2:26:57) to be in charge do you think women or children are going to be enforcing Jack
(2:27:02) [ __ ] nope I would assume the people that are to their job is that I don't saying
(2:27:09) that technology modern technology is giving you both the illusion no you're
(2:27:15) you're under an illusion because of modern technology you think that you don't need men that you have exceptions
(2:27:20) like rights this is all very modern thinking if for some reason we had a reset and you didn't have air
(2:27:27) conditioning and computers and cell phones and electricity anymore none of
(2:27:32) you would be feminists there would be no such thing as feminism and there's a reason if you ever we don't live in that
(2:27:38) world why does that matter so I'm saying it can always go back it can always go
(2:27:43) back but we don't live in that world live in that world let meon
(2:27:51) yes I will demonstrate it I can prove it I can prove it if you shut up okay did we just overturn R versus Wade did we
(2:27:59) just overturn Ro versus Wade yes like in case do you know that in Afghanistan
(2:28:05) they put the Taliban back in power and all those beautiful rights women we're enjoying are now gone you know that in
(2:28:11) Russia they granted right to abortion and right to no fault divorce which was then taken away in the
(2:28:17) 1930s there there's same thing in Germany bimar Germany had lots of socially liberal feminist policies that
(2:28:24) were revoked I'm saying these rights are granted to you by Men by their good
(2:28:30) graces and can be taken away at any time and have been taken away multiple times
(2:28:35) in the modern era so you're living under a delusion we're not saying
(2:28:41) women we not it does wa maybe wait wait wait wait wait wait maybe we can clarify this maybe we all agree something
(2:28:47) happened in other there are god-given rights to every person like for example I think Andrew and Rachel would both
(2:28:53) agree that a fetus has a god-given right to life it does not you're making an a claim we think they wait so those
(2:28:59) god-given rights are mainly enforced like if you if it comes down to the physical enforcement of it are enforced
(2:29:05) by men yes yeah but in general men and women both work together to make sure
(2:29:10) people's rights are upheld their god-given rights sometimes they do yeah they have they have to men and women
(2:29:17) don't act they don't act like trarily of each other that's not the right word but you know what I mean separately
(2:29:23) sometimes they do let me actually let me let me wait let me make my point uh because this is
(2:29:28) an interesting point I think that's gonna cause you guys to maybe have to reflect on this so I call this the floodgates argument uh I was thinking
(2:29:36) about this after the first debate Andrew had about this so I'm gon I'm gonna be a little longwinded but I'm gonna bring it back so uh for a long time right like um
(2:29:44) you know black people had no rights right but you know once we got rid of slavery and once we ultimately got rid
(2:29:49) of Jim Crow and the 60s right uh black people you know came into power and at this point you could not white people
(2:29:54) could not really take rights away from black people but you know 100 years ago yeah for sure they needed to rely on white people to get their rights I would
(2:30:00) say it's the same thing with women right so for a long time wom couldn't vote and that point yes they relied on the
(2:30:06) benevolence of men for their rights but now that they have the right to vote no no no they didn't wait hang on hang on let me finish but now that they have the
(2:30:11) right to vote right the floodgates have been opened and I think at this point because the floodgates are open uh I
(2:30:17) don't think that men would be able to just completely exclude them from Power so your entire so your entire argument
(2:30:22) is a slippery slope argument how so well because you're saying that because you're saying that the
(2:30:30) descriptor here is that because X thing happened right then this means that X
(2:30:35) thing cannot be retracted and that's not true it can be retracted you can still take rights away from black people you
(2:30:40) could still take rights away from women you could still take rights away from children rights we're talking about legal rights yeah so when we're talking
(2:30:46) about metaphysic if you're talking about metaphysical rights great you still haven't really told us what a
(2:30:52) metaphysical right is you say that babies for instance have a right to life from God but babies die Grace so what is
(2:30:58) the right to life from God a right to life from other people they have a right to not be killed they have a right to
(2:31:03) their life I haven't talked we're talking about legal rights talk let me just talk
(2:31:08) to you just let me get a few words do you think instead of saying rights being granted by men it would be
(2:31:15) more ACC to say rights being granted by people in power no because men are always going to inevitably be the people
(2:31:21) in power because of the strength Dynamic difference men have the nuclear option to use force and there's nothing women
(2:31:29) can do about it this is an OP is Gap you guys think we're arguing no shut
(2:31:35) the [ __ ] up and you might learn something you don't understand the difference between an ought claim and an
(2:31:41) is claim we're not telling you what we think ought be we're not telling you a description of how we think the world
(2:31:47) should run or what rights people should have we're telling you these are Concepts that are subject to change and
(2:31:53) that when it comes down to it men are the ones that have the Monopoly on Force technology hasn't changed that nothing's
(2:32:00) ever going to change that because even with technology I'm a Firearms instructor I teach women to shoot most
(2:32:06) of them don't have the hand strength to prop properly operate a semi-automatic pistol most of them need multiple
(2:32:13) lessons to get over the loud noise they don't like the loud noise so if you think women are going to take over at
(2:32:20) any you're completely D nobody said that women are going to
(2:32:25) take over you just have this ridiculous idea that men can decide to do things and women don't need to be in harmony
(2:32:30) with them men and women work together men do not have they don't have the power to just arbitrarily
(2:32:36) enforce that you just assert that you don't you're not making an argument for Rachel does Andrew have does Andrew have
(2:32:41) the power to to enforce whatever he wants on you if he chooses if he so chooses and the only no no no answer my
(2:32:48) question answer my question answer my question that's a fair question does he have the right toce whatever he wants on
(2:32:55) you if he backs it up with physical power does he we're talking about men versus women not an individual relation
(2:33:02) you need to answer the question that's no I don't by the way by the way while I'm here while I'm here shut your face
(2:33:09) shut your stupid mouth because the two of you are both constantly on here you didn't answer the question you
(2:33:16) didn't answer the question she did answer the question she said
(2:33:21) so the answer is no so Andrew does cannot enforce whatever you need to stoping and acting like I'm in an
(2:33:28) abusive relationship stop acting I I steamroll both of you dumb bimbos
(2:33:35) abusive not the person who's abused I'm not the person you're the abuser if
(2:33:41) anything but I don't care what the hell your relationship is I'm saying your logic is wrong why so jealous what's the
(2:33:47) logic which part of the logic is wrong jealous is her answering no that I can
(2:33:53) enforce what I want on her an argument to men collectively being able to do so you idiot okay well can I ask a simple
(2:33:59) question related whatever you want on her could Grace would ever shut up collectively that means men can't I want
(2:34:06) to get her point across means men can't Grace you [ __ ] [ __ ] is that what you're saying grace never mind that
(2:34:12) women have taken over any never mind that women have taken over anyways women have taken over anyways women have all
(2:34:18) the power in this Society so you're it's not true women have all the power in society men say they don't anymore men
(2:34:25) could take it back tomorrow if they wanted to so why don't they because it sucks for men it sucks for men no no no
(2:34:31) he me out if a woman accuses a man of rape his life is destroyed no matter no matter how it's it's instantly destroyed
(2:34:38) his credibility is ruined even if it's completely false for men male enforcers why
(2:34:44) wouldn't men take the power back and say no we're not doing that anymore why haven't they done it yet because because
(2:34:50) of power dynamics of simps yeah there's lots and lots of men who will enforce
(2:34:55) who will enforce women's rights on their behalf and a lot of men uh who are
(2:35:01) outnumbered by those people that's why but you're the women are doing a really good job of getting them Sims huh seems
(2:35:07) like agree totally agree I've got a good I've got a good question for these girls
(2:35:12) do you guys think that women wanted the vote I think most women didn't want the
(2:35:18) vote actually during that time period Oh I thought you said to the vote did you say to vote no the vote did they want
(2:35:24) the right to vote yeah literally they did a [ __ ] ton of work to try and get that yes no you're wrong you're wrong
(2:35:31) most women only 4% of women wanted to be able to vote when the 19th amendment was
(2:35:37) passed it was passed by men it was passed by powerful rich men who wanted to double who else how else would have
(2:35:44) been passed [ __ ] that's exactly right Nina how else would it have been passed
(2:35:51) it wouldn't have it was men well because you just play pissed off the

(2:43:02) gonna bash her at all because um Ashley actually is a fan of me she and she and I had like a really great moment on
(2:43:09) modern day debate where we had like a little a really nice heart tohe heart and I made a community post when I was
(2:43:14) in the hospital and she was like uh praying for me and asking if I was okay so we're actually on very good terms we
(2:43:20) have a lot of different differing views but she's actually like pretty nice when she's a person you can actually discuss
(2:43:27) things with yeah yeah she's not a craing [ __ ] mess that we have in
(2:43:32) front of us today see the you showed us your already baked cookies so turn the camera on
(2:43:37) let's see your pretty little face let's go ahead come on come on you're not cooking anything is is there anything
(2:43:43) demands from you you show all your Tu come on come on let's see it you
(2:43:48) physically I'll tell you what she hang on I'll tell you what Grace that seems fair go grab your panties and [ __ ]
(2:43:53) lick them and then she'll come on like you've done before on stream I didn't come at her for anything physical because she's not she's not brave enough
(2:44:00) why you why do you just get the [ __ ] out of here Grace just this is a
(2:44:06) little right all right all right chill chill chill chill this seems like really interpersonal I don't understand what the [ __ ] you're talking about so two
(2:44:13) middle-aged adults have to tag team against a 20-year-old and you still [ __ ] lost by Nina listen Nina
(2:44:19) reasonable nah is reasonable and you can talk to her and actually nah deserves a lot of credit she has left she has left
(2:44:26) it's fine that's FY pretty hard there I was trying to give Nina some credit because it's I
(2:44:33) don't need your your Fed Credit it's fine I no I'm just saying like the concern
(2:44:40) the concern trolling annoys me but you do come on and you do these debates and you try to engage in good faith and you
(2:44:47) try to sort the [ __ ] out doesn't do that Grace Just screams at people I'm just saying grace is just she's like we were
(2:44:54) in the exact same opposite situation you would say the exact same thing about her and the exact same thing about me so I you don't have to do this would be
(2:45:00) logical if she if you were I appreciate talking toel she would
(2:45:06) be right Andrew Andrew can I can I please talk to Rachel well no I need to correct this
(2:45:12) though because no I can't you just literally if the rules were reversed you
(2:45:17) would say the same thing about her to me ask her opinion on it so why are you answering for her my guy Jesus [ __ ] I'm
(2:45:24) just saying I can [ __ ] engage in the panel you crazy I can engage in the [ __ ] panel what are you talk let Nina
(2:45:31) ask the question to be fair she hasn't talked much in the last 10 minutes [ __ ] I was just asking do you think that you
(2:45:38) would feel the same way if it was like the reverse because I just feel like um you you kind of just don't like either
(2:45:44) one of us and that's fine no there's a whole backstory with grace that you don't know about there's been crazy
(2:45:51) behind the scenes well I can't even tell you it's like a year-long saga of them chasing us and harassing us and
(2:45:59) pestering us doxing us they're literally insane and I'm not joking her they're
(2:46:04) creepers they're psycho creepers so it the whole Grace thing has nothing to do
(2:46:09) with like ideology I disagree with you totally on ideology um but I can engage
(2:46:16) in debate and conversation with you I can't do that with her because she's unhinged and insane so that's the
(2:46:24) difference what are your opinion on sticker noodles H not really a fan I'm more of
(2:46:29) like a white chocolate macadamia or like a chocolate chip person oh you get fancy with it okay I know Andrew loves the the
(2:46:36) M&M's right I like chocolate chip too chocolate
(2:46:42) chip I I did find it kind of weird how Ben kept trying to like sneak on like I
(2:46:47) don't know I find that that was making me uncomfortable I didn't like that at all uh yeah okay let's
(2:46:54) Li he's a piece of [ __ ] [ __ ] so why would anybody like him so it's like it's pretty simple all right I want to bring
(2:47:00) on the next person because I do want to wrap up soon uh Rachel appreciate you coming on we'll see Rachel good to hear
(2:47:06) from youas oh sorry uh let me bring out radical code what up what's going on
(2:47:15) hello hey how's it going um I actually wasn't planning on coming up but the chat started like a
(2:47:22) few people in the chat told me to and I was like okay I mean I thought Alex was wrapping up soon but if not then I mean
(2:47:27) uh yeah I want to but yeah okay well uh I guess I only tuned in until like the end of it um but I've heard Andrew talk
(2:47:33) about this whole uh the whole like men if all the men like collectively got together and decided to take away
(2:47:39) women's rights they wouldn't have rights um first of all like even I I guess like even if I agreed to like the whole thing
(2:47:44) like I don't know like what the what like the point of the argument is like is there like anything like meaningfully
(2:47:50) draw from that like like what what AR yeah like where does it go from there want to hear it yeah I do okay so the
(2:47:57) the argument is pretty simple that men and women can't actually be in an egalitarian relationship it's not
(2:48:03) possible because the power Dynamic is structured in such a way that you cannot
(2:48:09) beg or request your rights from a group and then be equal with that
(2:48:14) group okay so I guess like so there's like a there's a pinnacle of a gal iism that could can never be reached no
(2:48:20) matter how hard we try is that kind of the thing so like I guess like does that is that an argument against like trying
(2:48:25) to strive for that Pinnacle well it's not an a claim it's just a descriptive is okay so I I mean I guess like the
(2:48:32) what I would say then like even if even if I agreed to all your premises which I don't I don't think I do but even if I did like guess premise of the is claim I
(2:48:39) don't can can I finish my sentence if it's not claim okay well I no well no no
(2:48:44) I'm going I'm saying even if I grant you your your is claim no I want you to dis I know what you want I know what you
(2:48:49) want I'm not I'm not here to give you what you want I'm just here to say I'm you're going to argue against a non-argument you're going to [ __ ]
(2:48:55) piss me off I'm just adding I'm just adding more information do you have a problem with the is claim uh I'm not
(2:49:01) sure I'll have to think about it more but um about anything else you have you don't have to listen to me you can Alex brought me on to say my piece and let me
(2:49:07) do it all right don't cry about it don't cry about it I would say that that what I think the implication of what you're
(2:49:13) when you argue this when you say that there's that we can never reach its egalitarian society I think that the implication there is that we shouldn't
(2:49:19) we shouldn't also try to reach that Pinnacle I would just say I think we should still strive for that Pinnacle even if at some point we find some
(2:49:25) inequality still exist among men and women that are like uh that are opt in or that are a matter either sorry sorry
(2:49:32) I miss either opt in or or just a matter of a fundamental truth about reality just to
(2:49:38) know let's go back to the is okay so first of all when you talk about all these societies where like where most
(2:49:44) men or where all men like collectively decided to oppress all women that I don't think that's ever really existed
(2:49:49) either because it's not like all men have ever been able to like democratically control like um the the structure of society in that way like it
(2:49:56) was normally like a small a small minority of men always who have been able to call the shots in this regard so it's not like like like all men never
(2:50:03) locked arm in arm and decided to oppress women so men yes a tiny subset of men right but Men Who had who had authority
(2:50:09) over larger sets of men who they could have enforced that's my that's part of my argument is that men
(2:50:15) also right so then there's nothing wrong with my descriptive is this enti argument has been about my descriptive
(2:50:21) is the argument with phoh was about my descriptive is the argument with the Duke was about my descriptive is but you
(2:50:27) don't actually have a [ __ ] problem with my descriptive is do you uh at least not in the way I've described it no I don't think so I don't think so
(2:50:33) because it's logical and it's only thing that is true well meaningless it's only
(2:50:39) meaningless if there's push back on that it's true which there has been nothing much your main argument is because it is
(2:50:45) that means that it it will it will always be does mean anything you [ __ ] twit it just is an is statement there's
(2:50:51) no greater meaning of a for the 800th time nothing matters at all I don't I
(2:50:57) don't even believe you though I honest I'm very skeptical when you say there's no odd I feel like in the face I can't
(2:51:02) take it I can't take it anymore you're too F people are too stupid I quiet how can
(2:51:08) you be this dumb how can you be this [ __ ] stupid it's just argument are you making an argument that we're stupid
(2:51:14) or are you just saying that the argument that you're stupid is you don't know the difference between is claim and an not claim that's pretty [ __ ] stupid
(2:51:22) but we're so stupid yeah also like yeah we're also we've been engaging with it
(2:51:28) but even we're going to go with that like are you really going to say that that's worth just to punch you in the face because somebody's on do you punch
(2:51:33) yourself in the face when you're child does understand God just enough enough Nina I can't take it can't take it oh
(2:51:39) okay so seems very weak of you but okay yeah I've only addressed it 800 times I mean like 800 you address 800 times what
(2:51:48) point do I look at a [ __ ] wall and say look I've explained this 800 times you just not have you addressed it a
(2:51:53) single time have you addressed it a single time yes I've addressed that this is an is claim not an not claim of one I
(2:51:59) don't know how many times that that's how you address you just said an is claim and is an not claim no it isn't an
(2:52:04) not claim what if we what if we keep pushing towards the more egalitarian society and
(2:52:10) eventually it does actually become that then would you like accept that your premises are wrong like if we just reached this world somehow yeah yeah I
(2:52:16) would what would that look like to you I'm curious I don't think it's possible yeah but what like imagine it like be
(2:52:21) Crea imagine it because it's not possible can't imagine it to be honest
(2:52:27) it feels like you have a limited imagination that it's logically you could say it's logically possible well
(2:52:32) yeah that's why I'm asking you to describe right yeah but I don't know what that would look like okay fair enough I believe you so you okay so you
(2:52:39) just think that we should live in this world that you can't you would have to have like men you would you would have to set up the situation where men
(2:52:46) essentially had either the same strength as women or a lesser amount of strength than women physically but and physical
(2:52:53) strength doesn't mean anything right now yes it it still does mean something where you get this idea terms of like
(2:52:59) we're talking about like governance yes even with governance it means something
(2:53:04) how because men tend to follow men who are strong which is why men are always
(2:53:10) in [ __ ] charge how much you think you know Joe Biden won the election do you think how much do you think he benches I
(2:53:17) have no idea he's an old man what's your point okay so if uh if because you're saying that people follow strength
(2:53:23) physical strength so I'm not going to get into the Rock the election The Rock were
(2:53:31) doesn't yeah I don't want you to if the rock were to run for president you think he'd win I think that he would have a
(2:53:37) better shot than some spinley weak man yeah like Joe Biden I don't know if it would
(2:53:43) necessarily be Joe Biden strength can be Joe Biden is stronger or weaker physically only qualia
(2:53:50) Nina but you said strength yeah strength is the primary qualia for egalitarianism so I think in order for you to have for
(2:53:57) you to have Ryan's Utopia of actual egalitarianism for a logical possibility
(2:54:03) Andre do you think that you need to let me finish my answers or don't ask me questions I think that if you're asking
(2:54:09) it or answering some other weird understand that I don't I think I can cut you off with that that's what I'm
(2:54:15) asking I am I'm answering directly to what you president do you think that the rock would have a
(2:54:21) higher chance than Joe Biden and explain as to why or why
(2:54:26) not no I don't but I can't really get into the reasons I can't really get into
(2:54:32) the reasons why I think why not because of YouTube restrictions are you just racist what do
(2:54:38) you mean wait you know hypothetical what's the issue because you can't talk about election stuff on YouTube Alex you
(2:54:45) get hit with misinformation they take your channel down well because you asked me what external
(2:54:51) factors would you say would you Andrew say would be a limiter to The Rock Against Joe Biden I don't just think I
(2:54:57) didn't say that at all Andrew blink twice if Trump won the
(2:55:02) election so you just lie I kind of sense that you were just
(2:55:07) lying about the things that I say and now I realize you just lie that's not what what am I lying about what I just
(2:55:13) said what did you just say liit on that what else could it be you asked who I
(2:55:18) thought would be more likely to win no but you said that you couldn't say that you [ __ ] liar what am I lying about you [ __ ]
(2:55:25) lunatic what am I lying lying about what I said what what part of it repeat what
(2:55:30) you said that I said we can go back you're asking me you said who do you think would win in this election I said
(2:55:36) I can't really give you my true opinion because uh that's even what you just said how am much contagious to you that
(2:55:43) you have to just keep lying what am I lying about I don't know what I'm lying about I'm talking about the talk and
(2:55:48) [ __ ] Joe Biden my guy and you're like on a different level here yeah I am on a different level that's true yeah because
(2:55:55) you're not making any because you're lying that's how that works no I'm telling the truth that's how that works okay so what did you say that you're
(2:56:01) telling the truth what I'm saying is that there's some things that I can't speak to on YouTube if Alex gives me the
(2:56:07) nod even though he could get in trouble understand what he said the
(2:56:13) elections are rigged Nina they're [ __ ] rigged they're completely [ __ ] rigged do I think at the Rock if
(2:56:18) he declared himself to being a pres that is you lying that's you lying what facts do you have what facts Andre Andrew show
(2:56:25) me any facts literally any information that would prove that we can come back for an election debate no no no no right
(2:56:32) now One Source literally One Source okay so let's take a look at I can actually
(2:56:38) give you the group I just uh just had this disc I One Source I'm asking a source [ __ ] Twi calm down this is a
(2:56:46) [ __ ] source so if you want to so this particular
(2:56:52) Source trying to remember what their names are but they did a uh this was in Pennsylvania and this group actually
(2:56:59) came out against what was going on with the election fraud so just asking me to
(2:57:05) you know kind of site off the top of my head different sources for debate I wasn't here to have I'm not asking you to do it off the top of your head I'll
(2:57:11) give you time okay a give me a second and I'll pull it up while you're pulling
(2:57:17) that upom just a little bit of push back I don't really I don't know if I believe you when you say there's no like uh a I
(2:57:24) mean I understand your argument doesn't like have an a claim baked into it but I think the implication of you make the reason you're so like making this AR
(2:57:31) where did she go she said she R bathroom you pulled it up so we we can talk for a second while that's happening okay like
(2:57:36) it feels to me like the reason that you want you have this argument over and over and like that you're you've like dug your heels in so hard on this
(2:57:42) particular argument like unless you're just like you just want to prove that you're right about this it's not an argument okay this it's an is okay your
(2:57:51) your your your perspective on this descriptive claim of reality right like the reason you've hammered down so much
(2:57:56) on this over and over it feels to me that like you you would do that because think there's some I understand that you
(2:58:01) don't have to let me talk let me talk you you don't have to care I'm I'm just speaking okay let me let me talk I'm
(2:58:07) giving you my my perspective on my description of reality okay we're both we're exchanging these and I'm telling
(2:58:13) you from my perspective it feels like you would be making this argument over and over because you do think there is some meaning there is something
(2:58:19) meaningful to draw from it right something meaningful about like what we can do moving forward with society that
(2:58:24) is relevant to this claim do do you disagree yeah for the 300th time it's
(2:58:29) just a descriptive iscla the reason reason that I use it against feminists is to watch them fall on their sword
(2:58:35) over and over again trying to rage against a reality which is not really you can't really uh reject it it's just
(2:58:43) a true statement and so watching this happen over and over and over again on this Channel and on others has been
(2:58:49) [ __ ] hilarious for me okay well I'm glad you've had fun with the weird hypothetical but it does I I don't see
(2:58:56) much meaning from not hypothetical it is I mean it is a weird hypothetical to say that like all men are going to lock arms
(2:59:02) against all women like we're have this like gender War Fair like like uh like those YouTube videos where they put a thousand hus thousand Iron Man's like
(2:59:09) comes after the rejection Pro that the election was still in or yeah so you can look you can look real quick this
(2:59:15) particular group is called the PA Patriot you can also look at what happened in Arizona with the Supreme Court rulings
(2:59:21) there's several pieces of evidence that we can go over cour rulings were all in favor that it was a wasn't you're wrong
(2:59:29) that's not true you're incorrect pull pull it up pull it up and show me all of them you want me to pull up you time n
(2:59:37) I'll give you time well you I gave you time you didn't give me anything why the [ __ ] are you want I'm not gonna you put
(2:59:43) me on the defensive here [ __ ] just gave me two sources no problem with my sources
(2:59:49) where is it in I just said the PA Patriots came out against this they talk you link it in the general why would I
(2:59:55) link it in the general what here on the election could just make up anything
(3:00:00) what the you talking a debate on the election Qui gonna get problematic here
(3:00:06) with the the T here let me just say this real quick I just quickly looked into it and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court uh
(3:00:13) denied they struck down the idea that the election I said Arizona for the Supreme Court I'm talking about the PA
(3:00:19) Patriots that's a different thing what is the PA Patriots PA Patriots is a
(3:00:25) group of politicians and observers who are on the ground who said that they saw massive irregularity it's not a
(3:00:31) government it's not a government uh some of them are government officials yes no no because you're a government official
(3:00:38) and you're part of say does not mean the corporation is government part of the government yeah if you're a government official you're part of that means okay
(3:00:44) if you're part of like the Boy Scouts and you work for like the government is the boy has a government thing no but
(3:00:50) you would still be a member of the government exactly so shut the [ __ ] up about that you know that you're wrong an
(3:00:55) idiot about this that doesn't make sense what you just said really is a performative contradict doesn't even
(3:01:00) make sense okay so is the okay is the company that you're or the the organization that you're referring to is
(3:01:06) that a government organization wait I'm also looking at this there are government officials who
(3:01:11) are there yes because the government official that is in a group is not mean hold on just
(3:01:19) one second one second just because government officials are in a group does not mean that that group is a government
(3:01:25) organization that's really stupid if you think that's I didn't say they were government organization said they're part of the
(3:01:30) government yeah I just quickly looked it up about Arizona and um it says that basically uh
(3:01:39) even GOP members are saying no it was not uh rigged they did a uh hand recount
(3:01:44) and in the hand recount they found that Biden actually got even more votes than in the uh in the real one so yeah that
(3:01:51) never happened no it did happen there's still contention in Arizona as to the legality the majority of people that
(3:01:58) were caught for voter fraud were Republicans by the way I've heard that as well might be true I hope so yeah
(3:02:03) well again if you want to come back and have a debate about election fraud we can do that but that's not what the purpose of this debate's about okay
(3:02:11) you're not gonna do that because yes I I mean honest that's not a debate I'm just right yes it is a debate
(3:02:18) how we we can we can have this U discussion another time I do want to wrap up we're going on three hours um let's just get into if any Ron you want
(3:02:24) to say a closing thought Nina and true and then we'll yeah yeah I'll be I'll be pretty quick um yeah so again I I think
(3:02:30) I think it is kind of a weird hypothetical because the idea it like rests on like if all men like collectively locked AR and arm locked
(3:02:36) arm and arm and decided to oppress all women like even in past societies where like um the men were specifically
(3:02:42) oppressing women it was always like these aren't usually like Democratic societies that are actually built up of like even even most men voting for this
(3:02:49) kind of structure um but but even even regardless of all that I I don't believe Andrew when he says that there's no like
(3:02:55) uh a claim being suggested to or or or alluded to here like I think there is I
(3:03:01) I think well I don't know exactly but I i' say something something along the lines of like a um an upholding of
(3:03:07) patriarchy you know this this kind of of thing it's it's vague um but I think that's kind of like what you're s what
(3:03:13) you're alluding towards but um yeah I mean that's that's all I really have to say I yeah I don't I know if it holds up
(3:03:18) I don't know if there's any like anything real we can draw from this that like uh is useful you have a problem with my descriptive is claim or not uh I
(3:03:25) think there are several problems but like again I think in reality if if actually all men like went to war like
(3:03:32) hand inand with all women like yeah the men would probably win and if that's all you're saying then I guess that's that
(3:03:38) that's fine I'm also saying that you can't have true egalitarianism because you're always
(3:03:43) going to be begging your rights from men if you're women yeah well I guess the final thing I'll say is that we we seem to have gotten closer and closer to a
(3:03:49) more egalitarian society with time and that there's no reason to assume that that's not going to continue going even if at some point like we still see like
(3:03:56) some disparities between men and women because like men and women are not the same like obviously everyone knows that not so so so yeah I mean we're still
(3:04:03) probably going to see some disparities but it doesn't mean we shouldn't strive towards uh equality but anyway Alex Alex
(3:04:08) Alex I appreciate you having me on uh Nina always a pleasure Andrew unblock me on Twitter don't be a [ __ ] dude and uh
(3:04:13) all right love you guys bye why why is it that everybody they just they're just like losing their [ __ ] minds they
(3:04:19) can't wait to get more of my attention right talk to this person you got to unblock me on Twitter like don't be
(3:04:25) [ __ ] [ __ ] and then maybe I'll treat you better well because it implies that you're unwilling to have discourse or debate with them yeah even though
(3:04:32) I've debated them 50 times right I have to like I have to so I have to continuously be in a Perpetual state
(3:04:38) where I engage with every human being on planet Earth as much as they want I didn't know he seems like he's somebody who comes on stream so like I mean all
(3:04:48) right let's get into let's wrap it up you know your closing thought okay um as usual Andrew showed
(3:04:54) himself to be a little bit of a a preu child where he just gets really offended by anyone disagreeing with him he for
(3:05:01) some reason is under the impression that for one women don't have guns um that like the copium of I am stronger than
(3:05:09) you so therefore I get to rule you it's very stupid doesn't make any sense um
(3:05:14) and you're just going to stand on that because you're really insecure about what you think about a lot of these things because you know that doesn't
(3:05:20) make any sense you're not like doing anything that like makes me do anything like I think that we're equals
(3:05:26) personally but you don't think that way right so it's really odd to me your your state of mind which I find very
(3:05:33) interesting every single time that I talk to you that I appreciate having your point of view because I do like
(3:05:39) talking to you because I don't understand how you think and I'm trying to understand it more and more every
(3:05:44) single time where I don't really think that you're trying to understand how I'm I'm thinking because every time that I
(3:05:49) make a point you just kind of distract and try and make it seem like I'm not actually saying anything because I think
(3:05:55) that deep down inside you you really do see what I'm saying but you refuse to
(3:06:01) engage with me on a good faith um way when it comes to like actually having
(3:06:06) your opinion change so um I do love talking to you all the time it's it's a pleasure and uh tell Rachel I love her
(3:06:14) as well so yeah so I'm with this you can of course find me on The Crucible or the
(3:06:20) alternative Channel The Crucible limited again uh thank you to our wonderful host
(3:06:25) Alex always enjoy collabing with him he's always been nothing but good to me even though he's a degenerate [ __ ]
(3:06:31) piece of [ __ ] I still like the guy right and I I talk with people from all walks of life and will'll even collaborate
(3:06:37) with them I don't think he's a bad man intrinsically uh also just so that you
(3:06:42) understand kind of because Nina decided to give a second closing argument for no particularly good reason I can ascertain
(3:06:49) the reason I don't need to engage as much with her worldview is because I actually understand her worldview she doesn't understand mine she's never
(3:06:55) taken the time to understand it she wouldn't say ridiculous things like Christians have no justification things like this [ __ ] absurd on his face
(3:07:02) right they don't they don't even know what they're talking about whereas progressivism just kind of this surface level materialistic
(3:07:09) nonsense I did engage with every argument that nah made she just didn't
(3:07:14) make very many and she never really had anything to say about my descriptive is same as radical coder when radical coper
(3:07:20) came on he basically just kind of conceded what you're saying is true but
(3:07:26) I think there's an implication there it's like maybe you think that but just engage with what I'm saying is is it
(3:07:33) true or untrue and consensus and overwhelmingly in every single debate I have on this topic on this channel or
(3:07:39) other channels just with this single descriptor is that inevitably it ends up
(3:07:44) that I'm proved completely correct and they just think that there's a nefarious reason behind me making an is claim for
(3:07:51) what's just true there doesn't have to be a nefarious reason for me pointing out what's true it's just true and
(3:07:58) that's all you need is that it's true we can't run away from what's [ __ ] true
(3:08:03) and I'm never going to do that I'm always going to say what is true regardless of what you think the
(3:08:08) implications of that are and that's the insane mentality the actual insane mentality is saying don't say what's
(3:08:16) actually real uh due to the fact that people will think you have a nefarious implication
(3:08:21) or some alternative motivation for describing what is reality that's insane
(3:08:26) that's actually how insane people operate so that's what I'll leave you guys with cool uh all right hopefully
(3:08:32) you guys enjoyed that we had a really good turnout today if you want to see another Andrew debate we're gonna be doing one between him and Kevin Ray
(3:08:38) Wilder so yes Kevin Ray Wilder is coming out retirement we're going to do that debate in like a week and a half two weeks also I got some juicy debates set
(3:08:45) up myself for next week uh and then we're doing speed dating tomorrow so that should be fun I appreciate you all have a good night guys take it easy
