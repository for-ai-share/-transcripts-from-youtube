(0:00) you're just It's not psychic ability This is pathetic Nobody's going to
(0:06) You're going to have an argument I'm going to tell you what's going to happen This is going to go seriously Well this
(0:12) is going to go viral and a lot of people are going to take me seriously and all they're going to remember is that I told you that you couldn't put down the
(0:17) Dunkin Donuts long enough to make an argument You all are fairly stupid and everything that's being said is just
(0:24) like a comedy show You think you can change your sex how can you ever call anybody stupid
(0:30) john Oliver stirred controversy this week by hosting a special on what he calls a right-wing obsession with trans
(0:36) athletes in a large chunk of his once a week show two talking about the same
(0:43) issue Well JK Rowling told him to read the effing room and shared a post which
(0:48) slammed his 45minut special for claiming there's basically no advantage for male athletes and that men almost never beat
(0:55) women On that same night the UK women's pool championship final was contested by two women by two people who were born as
(1:03) men not women So who is obsessed and who is right well we'll debate that and
(1:09) we'll debate this too A lot of these men these podcast hosts on the right that like to think of themselves these big
(1:15) masculine men and what am I getting out of it i can tell you this There's that feminism I believe I'm feminism coming
(1:21) out Yeah there's the feminism Oh Oh I'm sorry Did you want to speak over a man inside of society right this second
(1:28) right Masculinity is not only punished but also women on the right covert feminists on the right are constantly
(1:34) and consistently talking about how they need to have privilege in society Their version of masculinity is men who take
(1:39) care of us men who protect us men who do all of this Those are all duties that men have towards women Great What are
(1:46) the duties that women have towards men well that became a breakout moment from our adolescence debate and Andrew
(1:52) Wilson's chilling warning of course about the dangers of covert feminism Well we have a panel of feminists covert
(1:58) and otherwise to debate The co-founder of Justice for Women and author of Lesbian Where Are We Now Julie Bindle
(2:05) the trans rights advocate Stacia Underwood the sports journalist and political commentator Emily Austin and
(2:11) the host of The Crucible Andrew Wilson Well welcome to all of you Um Julie
(2:16) Bendle let me start with you with this whole issue of trans athletes in women's sport I've been talking about this as
(2:23) you have for many years and we've reached a point where the current president of the United States uh has
(2:30) basically announced a total ban on any trans athletes competing in women's sport including at the uh upcoming you
(2:38) know global events happening in the United States which is great but it seems to me utterly astonishing that we
(2:44) have John Oliver who's a fellow Brit who is on American television and for 45
(2:51) minutes seriously trying to argue that people who are born biological males
(2:58) have no advantage over biological females when it comes to sport How can
(3:04) this still be happening it's utterly ludicrous Either we have women's sports or we don't Either we recognize that
(3:13) sports are segregated for good reason or we don't and we put everybody in together and then see what happens Which
(3:20) is like the bad old days when girls and women wouldn't come forward to compete or they wouldn't join tournaments Even
(3:26) if you look at something like poker which Oliver was joking about how can this be an issue how can poker even be
(3:35) discriminatory there's no strength involved But the sexist environment
(3:41) uh of poker tournaments and what men would call joking and teasing and the
(3:47) like put many women off competing And so let's just see what happens if we then
(3:52) decide that there should be no single sex sports and that women's sports were ridiculous to start with because that's
(3:59) what he's arguing Yeah Stacia Um look I as I've repeatedly made clear about my
(4:05) own position which often gets completely misconstrued as I think does Julie's as I think does JK Rowling and everybody
(4:12) else you know my position is that I absolutely respect uh people who are
(4:18) trans I respect people who are transist rights to fairness and equality and safety I want trans people to have the
(4:24) same fairness equality and safety that I enjoy uh or that my daughter enjoys for example So let's be clear about that
(4:31) Nothing that I'm about to say is what some people try and frame it as as transphobic right i'm not remotely
(4:37) transphobic Uh I am fully supportive of trans people's rights to lead the same
(4:43) life as the rest of us However and it's a big however when it erodess when the
(4:50) battle for trans rights to fairness equality in particular but also safety
(4:55) when that erodess clearly women's rights to fairness and uh equality and safety I
(5:02) have a big problem with that And no place is this more glaring than in the sporting arena where you see time and
(5:09) again now uh biological men who identify as trans who were pretty unsuccessful
(5:17) competing against other biological men and suddenly they're winning against
(5:22) women or taking Olympic places from women etc etc and I think the UN came up
(5:27) with nearly 900 I mean John Oliver tried to ridicule this but nearly 900 medals
(5:33) around the world I think in the last year went to trans athletes in women's sport This cannot be right It's not fair
(5:41) It's not equal as we saw in the Paris Olympics in the boxing ring where you
(5:47) had boxers competing who were banned from the World Championships because they had uh reportedly male chromosomes
(5:54) and you had women boxers quitting after 40 seconds because they'd never been hit so hard genuinely fearing they might get
(6:01) killed in the ring when it comes to this we are now reaching to me a not just an
(6:08) unfair and unequal place in this debate but a dangerous place in Mr debate What do you say to that
(6:17) [Music] um I think it's difficult Um I I think
(6:25) that there's a lot of emphasis being put on trans people in sports specifically
(6:32) Um I made it very clear like I am not here to spit facts or spew anything in
(6:38) terms of like statistics or anything like that I have my lived experience as a trans person Um
(6:44) I I just I I I I feel that there's so much attention being put on to this
(6:51) specific subject because what you guys really want underlying is the eradication of trans people and them to
(6:57) not be involved in any system No you see there look look but s look that is the
(7:03) dumbest thing I've ever heard in my life right it's it's ludicrous Where have you
(7:09) got that from where is anything I have ever said to speak out for others i'm more so referring to honesty
(7:18) I have seen certain things that you've said in other interviews Pierce with like my friend Wom and other trans
(7:25) individuals I just feel that the emphasis that is being put and what was transphobic what what have I ever said
(7:31) that could be remotely construed as transphobic or transhating or wanting to
(7:36) get rid of trans people ever i challenge you right now Tell me I have I haven't
(7:42) really directed that at you just from sitting here I more so am just here to
(7:47) say that I feel that the issue that's being pressed is because it's a you just
(7:53) directed it at him What are you talking you directed it at him
(7:58) i think that the issue that is being put on trans athletes is a way to eradicate
(8:05) trans people But this is with with respect This is Can I interject for a moment in in the 1960s and 70s when
(8:13) feminists that came before me set up women shelters rape crisis centers
(8:19) hospital wards prison wings for women Recognizing that some men not all but a
(8:25) sizable minority are a threat to women because sexual violence and harassment is a threat We weren't told by men not
(8:33) not all of them were pleased but largely they understood We weren't told by men you're trying to erase and eradicate men
(8:40) that the vast majority of men understood why we needed to do this All we're doing is saying men and you can call them
(8:46) trans women if you like but men have no place in women's prisons domestic
(8:51) violence shelters and sports Well wait a second Hang on Okay Emily you wanted to
(8:57) Yeah Andrew I'm going to come to you Andrew I'll come to you one moment Just let Emily jump in on what you're about to say I think to Stacia
(9:05) making America healthy again is all the rage and many people are inspired to put their fitness first again That's why I'm
(9:12) excited to be working with Dawn and my team at JackedUp Fitness which is an amazing American company Last week they

(10:13) I I just think it's so infuriating because ultimately I know many trans people and I spoken to them about you
(10:20) know playing in women's sports etc And the biggest issue they face is that they just want to be accepted Now if I was a
(10:26) trans woman and I just wanted to be accepted I'm gonna do the exact opposite of what you're doing You want to paint
(10:32) all of these labels on you You want to play identity politics You want to play the victim but you wanted to be treated
(10:38) as if you're any superior That's not equality You receiving special treatment that does not make you equal but makes
(10:44) you superior to others is not looking to be included It's actually making people detest your cause It's making people
(10:52) think that you are a And the way that you're trying to represent the trans community as a whole by just
(10:57) denying that there's a threat and being delusional about it is not helping the trans people You're you're making people
(11:03) look at you from the outside and say "Wow they are out of touch with reality." I think that the verbiage that
(11:08) you use in this statement is very clear on where you stand on trans issues I'm going to go back to my original point
(11:15) you guys trying to take out trans people as a way to eradicate
(11:21) trans but we're not nobody has said anything like nobody here
(11:27) stia nobody has said that and this this is what happens if you don't mind me
(11:33) saying what happens the way that trans activists let themselves down in my opinion and you can respond to this is
(11:39) that you try and shut down perfectly legitimate in fact urgently important
(11:44) debate by saying that anyone who dares to question this is transphobic and wants
(11:50) to get rid of trans people I don't think anyone so far on this panel has said they want to get rid of trans people or
(11:56) anything like it and yet you keep saying you people all want to get rid of trans people Why why do you believe that where
(12:04) have you got that from you cite my interviews with some of your friends but where have I said anything remotely that
(12:10) could be construed as transphobic i don't get it I think it's the verbiage that was being used It's very clear You
(12:17) guys stand on all trans people What do you What do you mean what do you mean what is the So what is the solution for
(12:23) the trans people that are playing sports what's the solution for them we're just supposed to kick them out all entirely There's no Let me give you the solution
(12:30) Let me give you the solution The solution is very straightforward Almost all of them competed against biological
(12:36) men like themselves before but they did it far less successfully So you either
(12:42) go back trans trans women athletes either compete against their biological
(12:47) sex or you create an entirely new category for trans athletes What you don't do is allow them to destroy the
(12:55) integrity of women's sport which is what is happening So it's very straightforward how you solve this I
(13:01) don't want trans people to be banned from playing sport I just want them to be banned like I did with the dopers
(13:07) when they were cheating in sport I want them to be banned from utilizing an unfair advantage It's simple as that
(13:16) I think Can I ask her a question would you think it's fair if NovakJokovic identified as a woman and then played
(13:23) Serena Williams in a tennis set do you think that that would be fair to Serena Williams who worked her whole life to
(13:28) become a star tennis player just to get swept by Novak who's the number one men's tennis player i just want to know
(13:35) if you think that that's fair Yeah but I just think that the question is ridiculous because the that there Why is
(13:42) it ridiculous it's not ridiculous at all I see I see how it's trying to be framed
(13:47) I just I'm I'm gonna keep going back to my original point your guys's excessive attention on wanting to remove trans
(13:54) people from sports and have them play in their biological sex which makes no sense because even in John Oliver's
(14:00) interview or in their own category in his the category that would make or in their own category there's not enough
(14:07) of them to create a category like the percentile is so small Actually there are there are actually there are there
(14:14) actually are an increasingly large number of trans athletes around the world Actually that's not true Andrew
(14:19) You've been waiting very patiently Thank you Um this seems to me this this whole debate so far highlights the way this
(14:26) debate has been framed now for years which is that any attempt to question
(14:31) what is obviously grotesqually unfair and unequal and indeed unsafe is branded
(14:38) transphobic even when there's no evidence to suggest that the people saying it are transphobic
(14:44) Well it's not just that I mean basically everybody in this panel is wrong So to
(14:49) start with uh this person says this person says well you know the thing is is uh uh you just want to erase
(14:57) transgender people altogether Pierce and then says I wasn't saying that Pierce I wasn't saying that you want to erase
(15:02) trans people not you specifically when clearly that's what you were saying at least get behind the statements that
(15:08) you're making The turf starts out by saying "Well I'm I've been here reinforcing women's rights this entire
(15:15) time right?" And then the turf says uh right on top of that uh well but you
(15:20) know poker is very misogynistic She can't wait to dunk on men Very first thing she does is dunk on men in order
(15:26) to somehow elevate women right you're all insane The truth is is that the only
(15:31) reason that this happens to begin with is because women vote for it They vote for it They vote blue They vote left
(15:37) They vote in the same politicians who get behind all of this stuff You're the deciding vote right and you have
(15:43) empowered women to do that as much as possible for the political process to do that All of you are responsible for this
(15:50) Every last one of you Really glad that you're so proud Trump Yeah
(15:59) Leave me out of this one I'm good Well we'll see Well that is why Andrew kept saying all of you Do you include Do
(16:05) you include Emily Andrew or not well I just assumed it I just assumed it But
(16:11) this is the truth The truth is we begin we begin we begin with these crazy these
(16:16) crazy ideas right under under patriarchal rule under men this would never have happened right if you look at
(16:23) how men vote they vote against this nonsense And it's fathers who are on the front lines against it It's women who
(16:28) are trying to transition the children not men Give me a case example of where male fathers are trying to transition
(16:35) their kids It doesn't exist It's a female only phenomenon Literally a female only phenomenon That is insane
(16:42) Yeah Show me one Show me one male father who's fighting in the courts to transition their son to a girl I made a
(16:50) podcast I see men on TikTok that are are diseased I I interview quite a few
(16:55) fathers that are pushing for this But the point is that this is something that benefits men and it's men that are the
(17:01) ones that are saying they're women They are all of a sudden the oppressed and feminists like me are the oppressor and
(17:08) that they want they're too weak and pathetic to fight and play against other
(17:15) men And what do they do they come and beat up on women Do you vote left ma'am
(17:22) i don't know what vote left means Do you vote for the left-wing party of your nation vote for Democrats do you vote
(17:28) for what would be considered the Democrats of your nation no I wouldn't have voted for the Democrats I would not
(17:33) have voted for the disgrace of that party and I also wouldn't have voted for Trump But the point is if we look Hang
(17:40) on let me finish We'll follow quickly very quickly Very quickly we live in a different context What I'm saying to you
(17:46) is this It's very simple If you look at the voting patterns of women in both the UK and the United States they're usually
(17:53) the deciding vote when it comes to degeneracy That includes anything it it includes on the trans issue So here you
(18:00) are It's the very thing that you push for for empowerment of women that is now causing your very problem You have to
(18:07) now convince women Men are already there Men have already said "Nope we don't want this We never wanted it It's
(18:13) garbage to be women." Yeah Apart from the women who are claiming to be men which now it's almost
(18:20) equalized Remember that part right this phenomenon though is categorically rejected by men and reinforced by women
(18:27) and turfs like you did everything that you could possibly do in order to push that You did everything you could do to
(18:33) push that and now you get to reap the whirlwind So I don't care if women in their sports teams are getting their
(18:39) teeth kicked in I don't care Reap what you sow As you as as you sow so shall
(18:45) you reap And that you get exactly what you deserve You seem like a lovely person I'm sorry that you have to deal

(20:26) Now on with the show on the subject of because Andrew made a lot of news on social media with his
(20:34) debate with Tommy Lren last week after accusing her of being a covert feminist
(20:39) Let's remind people of that clip which went viral Most men are born to be protectors and providers I can't imagine
(20:46) my dad saying you know what to my mom you know what i'm not going to be a protector and a provider unless you do
(20:52) this That's not how real men operate Real men are protectors and providers
(20:57) and they marry women who hopefully have a woman telling us what also bring a lot to the table as well that are great
(21:03) mothers great wives caretakers of the home There's nothing wrong with being a traditional wife and mother So Emily
(21:10) where do you sit are you a covert feminist like Tommy did you agree with Andrew's assessment
(21:17) i'm not a covert feminist I am very outwardly you know the word feminism has been hijacked by like the woke left who
(21:24) uses it as an excuse for psychotic women and liberals to scream on the streets we want equal rights when we have equal
(21:29) rights Um I'm more so an empowered woman who encourages other women to you know be independent work hard chase your
(21:36) dreams And it that doesn't come at the expense of being feminine It doesn't
(21:41) come at the expense of now as a feminist you need to eradicate all men I don't think everything is so black or white
(21:48) Listening to that debate they spoke a bit about gender roles and here's my take on that If you're going to have
(21:53) gender role expectations for your man that's a personal choice Emily Austin has high expectations of her man He has
(22:00) to be working hard He should be successful He should you know pay attention to how I feel like there
(22:05) should be certain gender roles He has to provide for the family Not solely but he should be providing for his family These
(22:12) are gender rules As a woman I learned how to cook I know how to clean My grand my grandmother always tells me my mother
(22:19) tells me Emily you're going to be a good wife You're going to be loyal You're going to be supportive You're going to act like a lady Now there's many women
(22:25) who don't want to play that into the gender roles which is fine but then don't expect your man to go out and
(22:30) become masculine I think it's equal Like set the expectation and then date people who meet your expectation But in terms
(22:38) of covert feminism it's first of all it's such a silly term Either you support women or you don't And I'm not
(22:44) talking about the trans argument right now Not only is it not only is it not a silly term it is true that most of the
(22:50) political pundant women on the right are covert feminists And I'll just ask you the same exact question I asked the word
(22:56) feminist Let me finish let me finish the question Let me finish the question No I'm talking about all the way back to
(23:01) first wave feminism Okay you are feminist and I'll explain by asking you the same question If it is men's duty in
(23:07) society to procure refine protect resources which then men and women or
(23:13) I'm sorry women and children are the primary beneficiaries of which they are What societal duty which is equal to
(23:19) that do women have what is it women we're going to have children Men
(23:25) will never understand the burden of carrying a child So you have a duty to reproduce I expect women to be able to cook and clean Wait so you have women
(23:32) have a duty to reproduce absolutely Okay great So that's the one duty that's on par Great So that's one duty that's on
(23:39) par with that I totally agree Are they or is it the case that in every single
(23:45) nation in the west we are under reproductive rates in every single one of them in every single nation in the
(23:50) west we are lower than than uh where we need to be for reproduction So it seems
(23:55) that men are fulfilling their social duty and women are not And the problem with the right is that the right doesn't
(24:01) ever address this and right-wing females never address this Instead they say it's equal Work and and motherhood are equal
(24:09) They're not equal Not only are they not equal but let me give you another example here As you dive into this try
(24:15) to understand that what you do is you actually hamstring women by telling women they should go and be girl boss
(24:22) babes and go to college starting in their 20s They actually destroy their prime reproductive years They destroy
(24:28) them by having families later It's the primary That's silly I'm 23 Hang on Listen it's the primary cause for the
(24:35) reproduction cris It's the primary cause of the reproduction crisis in the west is that with women defer families till
(24:42) they're in their 30s Why do you think the average age of marriage is 32 in the United States i think it just got raised
(24:47) to 33 Yes you're going to have way less kids Okay Part of girl bossing is when
(24:53) you say career women are right on par with mothers They're not And society
(24:59) should be glorifying one not socially shaming the other but you shouldn't give them the same elevation you give to
(25:04) mothers and matrons of families That is pure covert feminism Okay I'm going to
(25:10) answer you with the following I I don't believe in the glorification and especially I see it amongst Jenzers of
(25:16) not having children I actually think it's disgraceful and I don't think it's a flex at all to brag about not wanting
(25:22) to repopulate It just shows me that you're so insecure that you're going to be a bad parent that you're not doing it
(25:27) On the other hand I'll ask you a question in return Would you prefer a child growing up in a damaged family
(25:33) with a mother who clearly wasn't ready to raise a child and raise potentially what could be you know a deranged child
(25:41) who grows up to be a serial killer or a murderer or how about this just a really bad person rather than wait a few more
(25:48) years until she's ready to have her kid and then raise a mench What What do you prefer well so here's what we can see
(25:54) when we break this down What we see when we break this down is the abuse happens in the public school where you're 100 times more likely to be essayed than you
(26:01) are if you're in a Catholic church We see that if it is the case that you're a single mother you are a single mother
(26:08) especially by choice that it's usually the selection of stepfather that leads to the abuse of the children We also can
(26:14) see via the stats that you're completely just uh insane here you are actually if
(26:19) you stay inside of a family where you mom and dad don't even like each other your outcomes are still better still
(26:26) better than if you the girl boss goes I just don't feel fulfilled I don't feel fulfilled and so I need to go and date
(26:33) the neighbor down the road or whatever right the truth is is that regardless of your fulfillment children are the duty
(26:39) the next generation is the duty and women have a duty to keep the family intact as well they're responsible for
(26:45) most of the divorces they file for the most amount of divorces not because of abuse but because of irreconcilable
(26:51) differences And when asked I don't feel fulfilled And it's like that's not how we run a society It's it's literally a
(26:59) death sentence for our whole society Look at what's going on in the UK It's a death sentence for him
(27:05) Okay let me bring in Stacia who's been grimacing uh throughout that Stacia why
(27:10) are you so outraged by what he's saying i'm not outraged I just think that you all are fairly stupid
(27:17) And everything that's being said is ridiculous And it's just like comedy show You think you can change your sex
(27:24) how can you ever call anybody stupid how could you ever call anybody stupid you think you can change your sex
(27:31) hey I'm not I'm not I I'm just sitting back watching the show happen I'm here for it
(27:38) All right Julie You were not Well hang on Hang on Hang on I want to get Julie to respond
(27:44) to Andrew Oh I zoned out and I thought I'd woken up in the 1950s in some TARDIS
(27:50) You can't take him seriously It's ridiculous Oh you mean in the 1950s you mean in the 1950s when we had intact
(27:57) families where 95% of women were getting married as virgins where families weren't being broken up where crime was
(28:04) extremely low where you only needed one income to support an entire household where mental illness was at an all-time
(28:09) low like that 1950s I'm sorry Did I make a reference to a time
(28:16) are you married married How do you make a married with many children you married with children oh she's she's ecstatic No
(28:24) I'm 23 Boss lady girl which seems to be driving you crazy
(28:29) working for the right guy to the only thing you have You have no arguments You just try to assault me personally You
(28:35) can try but the truth is is that I've reproduced I am married I do have married No you didn't You were making a
(28:42) passive aggressive to be fair about how my wife must be miserable Your wife must
(28:48) be miserable To be fair Andrew Andrew is p Andrew is practicing what he preaches And I want to I want to bring in another
(28:55) uh clip from a debate between Megan Kelly and Matt Walsh on the similar theme Let's watch a little clip from
(29:01) this Again having said that I like the guy I'm getting a little tired of his
(29:06) non-stop judgment of women who make different choices than the ones he wants us to make Sorry Matt You're not our
(29:12) Jesus We don't answer to you Like live your life the way you want to live it and stop judging everybody who makes a
(29:18) different choice I'm sick of it Covert feminism And she and she went on to say uh this about young men not wanting to
(29:25) marry career women Let's take a listen to this We're now telling young conservative amazing women that they're
(29:33) not attractive if they also work If they choose to let's say do what I'm doing and what you're doing and like get their
(29:40) voice out there But I'll stick with me just because I think conservatives listening to this will like the thought of another Megan Kelly voice up and
(29:47) coming Now Matt Walsh responded by saying "Men are generally not attracted to ambitious career." Well hang on a
(29:54) minute I want to read a clip from Matt Walsh or a quote He said "Men are generally not attracted to ambitious
(29:59) careerdriven women and women's first priority should be children and looking after the home." So Emily what do you
(30:06) think of that if you've ever felt like you're being watched online it's unfortunately
(30:11) because you are Hundreds of companies so-called data brokers watch and record
(30:16) everything you do on the internet Even if you're using incognito mode or private tabs they can still access every
(30:24) purchase you make every search you type and much more Your data can be sold to
(30:29) advertisers government agencies or insurance companies who could use it to charge you more You could stand by and
(30:36) accept all of this or you could reclaim your privacy as I have done for many years with ExpressVPN The app redirects

(31:29) expressvpn.com/pers Now on with the show I think the beauty about free will is
(31:36) you make a choice who you want to spend your life with Like I know many men are okay with you know a woman who works and
(31:41) I know many men are not And that's the great part is you choose who you want to
(31:46) partner with So if you want a woman to be home and have five six seven eight children which is a beautiful choice to
(31:52) make in life then go for it If you want a woman who can do both work and have children when she's ready two or three
(31:59) children then go for that type of woman If you want a woman who's never home and gonna be you know on the road all the
(32:05) time And trust me there are many beta men who would love that then go for that Like nobody is forcing you to be with a
(32:13) woman that doesn't cater to your needs The same way no one's forcing any women to be with a guy like Andrew Tate that's
(32:19) going to beat you and make you miserable We have choices and we need to make calculated wise choices as to what
(32:25) personally is best for you The Andrew Tate fallacy is simply moving over to to
(32:31) Andrew Tate is evil and a representation of men who believe in a patriarchal
(32:36) system Here's the truth The truth of the matter is is that we should be doing for society what is socially good for
(32:42) society If we can't reproduce our society that's a really bad social ill for society When you have propaganda
(32:49) that is telling women to go get useless degrees in psychology and sociology Yeah
(32:55) that's that's great Let me Andrew Andrew Andrew Hang on Hang on Hang on There's Andrew Quickly Is Megan Kelly a covert
(33:02) feminist then by your question over cover overt She's an overt feminist Covert's out for Megan Kelly Megan Kelly
(33:08) came out and said women should be prioritizing career over family That's what Matt Walsh's issue was with her And
(33:13) he's absolutely right The guy struck it out of the ballpark Socially in society we should be moving women into a
(33:19) familial role It's not to say that women can't work Nobody's saying women can't work We're just saying that if you're
(33:24) going to glorify things in society it should be the mother in the intact home and the wife and the the caretaker at
(33:31) home not the girl boss That's insane And it's a societal death sentence Walsh
(33:36) knows it Everybody knows this at this point If you can't reproduce your own nation you don't have a nation
(33:43) Do you know how Okay Julie you wanted to jump in there I mean do you know how insecure and pathetic you sound you
(33:50) can't take you seriously another donut But you I'll just finish I get that you
(33:56) reckon that you're some big shock jock and I know that you're desperately trying to be relevant but you sound so
(34:03) insecure and so pathetic You are in argument Can you put the Duncan down for
(34:09) a second and give me an argument do you have an argument or is it just I haven't heard one from you Yes I've given you
(34:16) multiple arguments for the social fabric of all of society and how we can improve it what we need to be doing what we need
(34:21) to be moving towards I gave you all the stats I gave you argument after argument Can you give me a single argument all
(34:27) the stats You are the oracle You know all about the universe and what's going
(34:33) to progress humankind You're just not psychic ability It's just pathetic
(34:39) Nobody's going to have an argument I'm going to tell
(34:44) you what's going to happen This is going to go seriously Well this is going to go viral and a lot of people are going to take me seriously and all they're going
(34:50) to remember is that I told you that you couldn't put down the Dunkin Donuts long enough to make an argument Now can you make one or not oh you know this is
(34:58) school boy By the way a real man doesn't speak down to a woman the way you do What you think you're not a real man
(35:04) You're actually very feminine What you think a real man is you're a very feminine man Yeah Nobody cares what you
(35:09) think real men are You sound super feminine Yeah Nobody cares what you think of real think that you're such a
(35:17) big boy by by slating bringing in personal personal insults about
(35:24) women I'm sorry I'm sorry You guys think that you guys into the the big wide
(35:31) world from behind your match well one day when I go out in the big wide world I hope people will take me as seriously
(35:37) as they do Women who make zero arguments Why are you on Morgan shouldn't you go be working right now making money for
(35:43) your family to support How do you have time to work what are you talking about i don't have a husband I'm 23 years old
(35:49) I'm not married with kids yet but it seems like you should go be working right now to fulfill your gender role as a big strong I am working right now
(35:58) Oh we get to work for a living You're not being paid to be here Yes lady I'm
(36:04) going to get paid a lot of money ultimately to be here You have no idea what you're talking about If you saw my bank account what I make doing stuff
(36:10) like this it would make you weep Oh show us your bank account to make yourself feel more secure Weep Yeah Hey the only
(36:18) thing you could think of was to try to assault my bank account Lady assault That's it That's the only thing
(36:24) you can think of The only thing you can think of is you don't work enough You don't work enough It's ridiculous Let me
(36:29) play I want to play Emily I want to play Emily a clip This is gone viral too It's had 120 million views There's a woman
(36:37) who suggests she's about to leave her husband because he doesn't do enough domestic chores Let's take a look If you
(36:42) do not participate in an equitable way in your home and so what does that look like what does it look like to change
(36:48) these dynamics well we need to really assess in our homes what the work looks like because in most homes this the the
(36:55) data supports this Women do a disproportionate amount of the work They just do They do more of the cooking and
(37:01) the cleaning and the laundry and the the child care while also working full-time And men have more time for things like
(37:07) their hobbies like golf for example or just working out running a marathon right and so we need to have hard
(37:12) conversations about what our time looks like what our labor in the home looks like what is invisible labor We have to
(37:18) talk about these things And when we don't the alternative is that you no longer have a marriage or you don't have
(37:23) a happy one at least And so I share this story because I don't think I'm alone in
(37:28) this experience And I want people to know that there's hope and that if you have a willing and able partner you can
(37:35) change this You can absolutely change this I mean Emily I I would personally I
(37:42) would travel continents to avoid a lady like that But what's your view of what she's saying
(37:48) to me her her her rant take away the gender for a moment because I actually believe women
(37:55) are a lot messier than men just in terms of our makeup our clothing the abund the abundance of clothing that we have I
(38:01) think we definitely purchase more accessories than men Um and I think we also like I said there are gender roles
(38:07) I believe in should be responsible for most of the cleaning Then on the other hand if you're marrying a slob a you
(38:12) should know who you're getting into a household with but b if you're in a happy marriage and you have a sense of communication why not just sit your
(38:19) partner down and be like "Hey I don't mind cleaning up after you but when you throw your filthy socks on the bathroom
(38:24) sink or you leave your wet towel and we have mold you know I'd appreciate if you could not do this but I don't think it
(38:30) gets to an extent where like divorce is justifiable unless your husband is like a hoarding like a hoarding pig that's
(38:37) unbearable to live with I think she's being a little bit dramatic here And we all can acknowledge women are a bit
(38:42) messier than men and it should be just like looking after one another It's not a big deal to clean up after your partner and that could go both ways Not
(38:49) everything is so black or white Andre well I mean first of all uh stay
(38:56) at home moms are mostly nowadays parking their kids in public school for most of the day Often times the kids are taking
(39:03) buses from the city to the school and buses home They're not even driving them Okay not even driving them And they have
(39:08) fully furnished lunch even breakfast at most of these public schools right they don't even have to send them with a lunch anymore They have all day to do
(39:15) household chores while men are working right no women do not do a disproportionate amount of work in
(39:21) comparison to men That's absurd No labor statistic supports that Even if we were to take household chores and put it on
(39:27) the table against a man's work doesn't even come close even with children especially because you're parking them
(39:33) most of the time in a public school for most of the day This this lady who's making this Tik Tok totally insane
(39:40) completely disconnected from reality has no idea how this actually works
(39:45) She's responsible You're going to make a choice to marry a girl who is going to cook and clean and do everything And me
(39:52) as a woman I'm going to make a choice to hire a housekeeper one day so that I don't have to cook and clean because
(39:57) that's my choice The problem is you're too obsessed with other people's choices Live and let live Like take a step back
(40:03) and recognize not everyone has to be as extreme as you are Like yes live and let live until it comes to the transgender
(40:10) They're not perfect That's exactly what I'm saying It's live till it comes to the transgender I don't care if you're
(40:16) transgender I don't care if you're transgender I don't understand Go for it I'm not marrying a transgender Let them go play
(40:22) their Let them live and let live Absolutely Live and let live You people contradict yourself That's their
(40:30) superiority Yeah No scope because I'm explaining myself and making sense The
(40:36) explanation makes no sense I saw Stacia wanting they should not participate in sports boundary Let's Staceia talk
(40:44) Staceia you wanted to say something We are just all walking contradictions It's crazy that you can even say something
(40:50) like that You guys are all fighting with each other about live and let live And we're having an entire conversation
(40:56) about trans people and their ability or lack of ability to be in sports So it's
(41:01) just it's wild to watch him with the cigarette like think he's all pompous and you over there acting like I I it's
(41:08) just ridiculous Hey I'm the only one here who is consistent I said I don't care if you people go in and beat the
(41:14) tar out of women I don't care Go do it They voted for it I think they need a taste of their own medicine I think it's
(41:20) good for them And maybe some of this madness will stop if they actually have to take accountability and deal with the
(41:26) consequences of their own voting You're actually insane you're into your I want to make it very clear I don't care that
(41:32) you're transgender I genuinely don't care if today you're a woman tomorrow you're a man the next day you want to
(41:38) identify as a cat or a dog I really don't like it's not my issue But when
(41:44) you make it my issue when you want to play in my sport I was a tennis player my whole life If a man came along who
(41:52) identified as a woman who I will respect as a woman I will respect your pronouns but you want to now eradicate women's
(41:57) sports Now it's my problem too It's not my problem and you will do you live
(42:03) Exactly Thank you Just live and let live man We all just be hippies and let me ask I want to end by asking Julie
(42:11) Okay I want to end by by asking Julie because Julie you've been talking about feminism for decades We're now in a
(42:17) place a strange place I think where women have more freedom to do all the things that maybe previous generations
(42:23) of women did not have freedom to do And many including me actually think that's a a very good step forward The only
(42:30) downside to this is that birth rates around the world are beginning to plummet to dangerously low levels And
(42:37) Elon Musk keeps warning that if they carry on like this it's going to be a very very serious problem for the future
(42:44) of the planet So let me just ask you Julie when you look at the the progress that feminism has made you can see so
(42:51) many ways that women's rights have been promoted in a better way but are you
(42:57) concerned about the dropping birth rates and the fact that women no longer because so many more are going out to
(43:03) work and everything else and prioritizing work perhaps over family that birth rates ultimately are
(43:09) obviously going to reduce and that ultimately that could be a very self-defeating thing for the planet We
(43:16) need to pay attention to the fact that many women when they have children have
(43:22) no support no child care feckless fathers who leave if they're there in the first place where there is very
(43:29) little maternity leave hardly any financial security particularly if that woman is in an abusive relationship and
(43:36) can't rely on that second wage coming into the home So have a look at what will make it more attractive and
(43:42) feasible for women to have babies And also have a look at the women who are
(43:48) choosing not to have babies because they don't want to be hitched to and trapped with a man who quite frankly isn't the
(43:56) the love of her life because of his behavior and because of his shortcomings That's what we need to be doing
(44:04) Okay I want to ask you a final question Yeah I mean I'll come to Emily I'll come
(44:09) to you and Andrew for final word in a minute but Staceia just struck me as a question I wanted to ask you How do you
(44:14) feel about drug cheats in sport you know when people are caught doping to enhance their performance how do you feel about
(44:21) that obviously you know how I feel about that You're baiting me to twist this around
(44:26) on the trans issue and I have no idea how you feel about it I've never asked you I've never asked you before
(44:32) How do you feel about that obviously I'm not obviously I'm not in support of people taking drug enhancements to do
(44:40) better in sports But but why why why are you not in support of that given it just gives them an unfair advantage which you
(44:46) want for trans athletes what's the difference exactly what they're trying to do and I'm not walking into it I you
(44:51) know I like it's very clear where my stance is with trans people I don't
(44:58) support I just think that you're trying to walk me into something and it's not it's not going to work for me
(45:05) So you don't argument enhancement of performance of illegal drugs Okay that's
(45:11) good We're halfway there I think Emily Yeah Pierce I just want to bring up a
(45:17) point that um and personally I don't know the stats I'd be very curious into looking into it but I think it would be
(45:22) remiss to not mention the fact that many many women personally I know a bunch but
(45:29) I want to see the stats on it are trying to have kids that are doing rounds of IVF spending all of their money that
(45:35) they've saved up trying to have a kid are infertile are having miscarriages never got their period I think we also
(45:41) have a really serious health crisis going on at least in the United States I can't speak about the UK that Bobby
(45:46) Kennedy is very well aware of about hormones and the foods that are making it a lot harder for women to have
(45:51) children because I know many many women who would love to have a big beautiful family but can't even conceive their
(45:56) first child So I don't know if it's necessarily everyone making a decision to not have kids rather a health problem
(46:02) and I'd be I'd advise everyone to look into that too It's totally absurd So first of all it's be the reason they
(46:09) need IVF and things like this because they defer families till they're in their 30s right it's not healthy for women to start having babies in their
(46:15) 30s Not a great idea Yes Yet not only is it true friend who can't I can
(46:21) statistically prove it The exception doesn't make the rule The truth of the matter is you can even look at infant
(46:27) mortality rates and in the United States we have some of the highest in the world and that is correlated directly to the
(46:33) fact that women are aged now aged out of their 20s when they're having children You can even see this in other nations
(46:39) as well Back over to the turf's argument He says "Well wait a second Uh we should
(46:44) really be deferring to uh women and incentivizing women for more stuff that women want We do this all the time We
(46:51) defer to everything that is that they want Uh you by the way you have free tuition You do get all sorts of free
(46:57) health care And by the way it's the poor people who have the most amount of children not the middle class or the
(47:02) rich who do family planning So you're this idea that you're just going to give the the idea that you're just going to
(47:08) give women money and that's going or some type of support in this way and that's going to be what moves them
(47:13) towards children It's not true Usually it's things like religion religiosity uh your your key component to
(47:19) traditionalism your idea of community has nothing to do with family leave It
(47:25) has nothing to do with that Never has The birth rate's been dropping like this like a rock especially since the 1900s
(47:32) right but even in the 1800s but now it in the since birth control especially and women's liberation the sexual
(47:38) revolution it has dropped so drastically we can't even reproduce the population
(47:44) These aren't answers You're not answering any problems None It's just
(47:49) because of men like you Okay Yeah It's because of men like me I know It's men like me The ones who actually reproduce
(47:56) It's because of men like me who actually reproduce I get it That makes sense So what do you suggest should women just
(48:03) start like "Can you can you reproduce do you do you even have a uterus to reproduce do you even have a uterus to
(48:09) reproduce?" But anyway what were you saying i'm sorry No I just don't understand What do you
(48:15) think is the solution women should just like kind of settle in their young 20s and just start popping out babies even
(48:21) if they haven't necessarily met someone that's compatible I thought I thought you weren't an anti antiatalist language
(48:27) Popping out babies Oh there's slaves of the stove popping out babies No I think that from a societal view we can have
(48:34) that language I've got to go Question I've got to go Sorry everyone You know
(48:40) what Julie julie I'm actually Everyone's going to go because we've reached the end of the panel The only sadness for me
(48:46) is we can't all go and have a drink together because I think we'd all get on great over a few pints in a nice English
(48:51) pub But maybe we'll leave that little treat for another time Uh thank you Thank you all very much indeed for joining Uncensored
