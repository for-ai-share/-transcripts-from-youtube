(0:00) Well, have you noticed that everyone is
(0:01) autistic?
(0:03) Yeah.
(0:03) Like I can out of all the dads I know,
(0:07) I'm just off the top of my head, I would
(0:09) say maybe 5% or more have one kid who's
(0:14) an issue.
(0:15) Yeah.
(0:16) And that wasn't it wasn't that way when
(0:18) I was a kid. And there wasn't as much
(0:19) abortion when I was a kid. There'd be a
(0:21) couple down syndromes hanging around,
(0:23) but like there's always that one son
(0:26) who's just like
(0:28) one of the big problems having kids
(0:30) late.
(0:30) It it Well, not only is that a big
(0:32) problem, but it's also birth control
(0:35) hormones.
(0:36) So, birth control hormones a per they
(0:39) women's bodies up really badly and do
(0:42) long-term damage that they they I still
(0:45) don't think they really have a good
(0:46) grasp on. Well, I think they were
(0:48) designed to be like a couple years of
(0:51) college.
(0:51) Mhm.
(0:52) But women are taking them from 16 to 30.
(0:55) Yeah. Yeah. I just got off the pill that
(0:58) I've been on for 16 years regulating my
(1:00) hormones.
(1:01) Lying to my body for 16 years
(1:03) and now it has to actually produce the
(1:05) stuff it's supposed You know what I
(1:06) mean?
(1:07) Yeah.
(1:07) I think it's a problem.
(1:08) Yeah. Have you heard this theory that uh
(1:10) it tells your it tells a woman's body
(1:13) she's pregnant?
(1:14) Mhm.
(1:14) So, she doesn't want to be around
(1:15) someone who's going to [ __ ] her. She
(1:17) wants a man around but a nonsexual so
(1:20) buddy like a brother. So they end up
(1:21) with these beta males effeminite guys
(1:24) who pose no sexual threat. Uh then they
(1:27) marry that guy. Then they go off their
(1:29) birth control and they're repulsed by
(1:32) So they go [ __ ] Chad.
(1:33) Yeah. And they say he smells different.
(1:35) Like they're completely revolted by
(1:37) their husband cuz he's a
(1:39) Yeah. One of the worst he is. And that's
(1:41) exactly what he is a well one of the
(1:43) worst things about this and there is
(1:46) some truth to this um to what to what
(1:48) you're saying often it is the case that
(1:51) if hormone regulations in a woman change
(1:54) right they become completely repulsed by
(1:58) whoever it was that they chose initially
(2:00) and yeah of course birth control is
(2:02) going to contribute enormously to that
(2:06) but women's women's mental health
(2:07) especially this when they're always like
(2:10) Women didn't used to be like this where
(2:11) they were all [ __ ] crazy. Where they
(2:13) were so irrational that even having a
(2:16) conversation with one was was next to
(2:18) impossible.
(2:20) Well, imagine frying your brain with
(2:21) birth control for years of your life. It
(2:24) literally makes you batshit crazy.
(2:26) Women's hormones um make them insane if
(2:30) they if if it's not through natural
(2:31) regulation. All you have to do is look
(2:32) at one when they're on their period and
(2:34) their hormones go [ __ ] crazy. Yeah.
(2:36) They become irrational lunatics for like
(2:39) five days and then they go right back to
(2:41) normal,
(2:41) right?
(2:42) But it's like that's why there's so much
(2:43) mental illness with women.
(2:44) Yeah. Well, I also think it's uh they're
(2:47) out of their element,
(2:49) you know?
(2:49) Yeah.
(2:50) So, they're faking and you see that on
(2:52) your on that whatever podcast all the
(2:54) time. These women are posturing like
(2:56) they debate for a living and they I
(2:59) think I've seen three different girls
(3:01) start crying and just leave
(3:03) cuz they're not in their element. make
(3:05) him cry all the time. But the thing is
(3:08) funny is,
(3:08) hi, this is Anthony Kumia
(3:10) and hello, I am Gavin McKinnus.

(3:31) um you know Brian he's he's you know
(3:34) it's his show and he has um you know he
(3:38) has him in all the time and he's just
(3:39) like you know he'll call me sometimes
(3:42) and he goes what the what the [ __ ] dude
(3:45) like how where does this all like is
(3:48) there any end there's no end right
(3:50) there's no end because there's so many
(3:53) now who can just go at you know 19 years
(3:57) old get on camera bend over open their
(4:00) ass chase and show the world their
(4:01) butthole and just have tons of money
(4:03) sent to them by these simps. That's how
(4:06) do you how do you convince a woman will
(4:08) give you what
(4:09) making $50,000 a month to just bend over
(4:12) and show her [ __ ] to stop doing that?
(4:14) How could I do that?
(4:15) Especially when there's no stigma.
(4:16) There's none. In fact, I'll talk to him
(4:19) and say, you know, you can watch episode
(4:21) after episode of me saying, "What did
(4:22) your dad think?"
(4:23) That's what I always think.
(4:24) Yeah. But I' I've asked so many of them.
(4:27) What does your dad think about you
(4:29) sucking men's on the internet for money?
(4:32) Yeah.
(4:32) Doesn't your dad walk in and say, "Stop
(4:34) being a [ __ ]
(4:36) always say the same thing. They say he's
(4:38) a fan. He loves you."
(4:39) Yeah. He loves it. He He tells me,
(4:41) "You're daddy's little girl and I'm so
(4:43) happy for you that you're making this
(4:45) money." And I'll tell him, I'm like,
(4:46) "Your dad's a piece of [ __ ] [ __ ]
(4:49) Tell your [ __ ] dad to call me.
(4:51) Tell your [ __ ] dad to call me so I
(4:53) can say, "What the [ __ ] are you doing,
(4:54) dude?
(4:55) Are you [ __ ] goes, "I couldn't I
(4:57) can't do stop being a [ __ ] and go in
(5:00) there and tell her you can't suck,
(5:02) honey. You're bringing shame to the
(5:04) family name." I haven't been to a strip
(5:06) club in 17 years since my daughter was
(5:08) born. Cuz I just see dads on stage.
(5:12) And I just think of him. He's probably
(5:14) got a 40 somewhere.
(5:16) He hasn't been around. And I just think,
(5:17) you [ __ ] loser. That's your daughter
(5:19) up on stage.
(5:20) No. And they don't care. They listen.
(5:22) They They don't care. And and I'll ask
(5:24) him, you know what? My mom actually
(5:27) gives me more push back than my dad.
(5:29) Your mother gives you more push back.
(5:33) Then your father
(5:36) get [ __ ] up your [ __ ] on the
(5:38) internet on Only Fans. And your dad's
(5:40) like, "You got to make that money,
(5:42) honey."
(5:43) Yeah, that'll always be there. Mom, how
(5:46) come you had so much money when you were
(5:47) 20? Uh, I don't want to get into it.
(5:50) Yeah.
(5:50) I mean, that's going to be there
(5:51) forever. Well, I've asked some of them
(5:53) who have kids. I'm like, "What happens
(5:56) when little Johnny comes over and he's
(6:00) like, "Hey, uh, you know, my friend
(6:02) Chuck, he just showed showed me, you
(6:05) know, you getting urinated on by five
(6:07) guys. Mom, what's going on?"
(6:09) Yeah.
(6:10) What? What's this?
(6:10) And that's 100% happening.
(6:12) It's happening all over the place. No
(6:14) way.
(6:14) And then they kicked my ass and they
(6:16) took my lunch money and called you a and
(6:18) you are and you are. That's accurate.
(6:22) They were correct.
(6:23) Yeah, you are a
(6:25) are objectively a [ __ ] prostitute.
(6:28) So, they're not even wrong. What's the
(6:30) defense, Mom? You know what's the def
(6:33) and the thing is they don't [ __ ]
(6:34) care. It they're so self-interested.
(6:37) They don't give a [ __ ] And um you know
(6:40) this it's a simpocalypse. It's a true s
(6:43) aocalypse.
(6:44) And I think we all have to take some
(6:45) blame for it too. Like you know that
(6:47) chick
(6:47) I'm not taking any blame for it. or
(6:49) Shanny Kane.
(6:51) We were talking about her the other day,
(6:53) the chick with dreads with the nose
(6:54) rings and she's like, "I'm a herbalist."
(6:57) Oh, yeah.
(7:02) Like her her baby daddy went to prison
(7:05) right after the baby was born and she
(7:08) couldn't make ends meet as a single mom
(7:10) and she ended up doing Only Fence. So,
(7:12) you know, as a society, I feel there's
(7:14) some culpability there. I don't I don't
(7:17) in a way I don't blame her. Going from
(7:19) two shitty jobs, Arby's and Costco, to
(7:22) tons of money being a I think that's the
(7:25) wrong way to look at it, though. Let me
(7:27) let me kind of counter that a little
(7:28) bit.
(7:29) If you're if you're looking through it
(7:31) through that frame and you're like,
(7:32) "Look, societyy's not taking care of it.
(7:34) Single moms, maybe not, but women are
(7:37) the gatekeepers of sex, not men. We'll
(7:39) [ __ ] anything, right? We literally we'll
(7:42) [ __ ] anything. If it's if it's last call
(7:44) at the bar and all that's there, right,
(7:47) is you know the the nasty bar skank.
(7:49) Well, you're going home with me.
(7:51) Oh, those are usually the best ones,
(7:53) maybe. But we will. They are the
(7:56) gatekeepers of sex. They can reject uh
(7:59) men from having sex with them. And they
(8:01) do it all the time. They're well trained
(8:03) at this. Okay.
(8:04) This is their thing.
(8:06) Yeah.
(8:06) So, if you're caught being a single
(8:08) mother, okay, it's is it's your [ __ ]
(8:11) fault. you [ __ ] up because you were
(8:13) always the gatekeeper of sex to begin
(8:16) with. You [ __ ] up and you do have take
(8:18) responsibility. And there's many who who
(8:20) have
(8:21) who say, "Look, I did [ __ ] up. I have to
(8:23) change things around." And great. I'm
(8:25) happy to see that. Great. Fantastic. And
(8:28) you didn't kill your kids. That's even
(8:30) better. But the what about the meno
(8:32) argument? What about the men? Isn't it
(8:35) really the men? No, it's really not the
(8:37) men. The women are the ones who are the
(8:41) gatekeepers. They're the access keepers
(8:43) of sex. And all they have to do is what
(8:46) they've done traditionally for thousands
(8:47) of years and close their [ __ ] legs.
(8:49) It's it's not that hard. You know what I
(8:51) mean?
(8:51) Well, this may be too personal, but
(8:52) didn't your wife marry a a douche?
(8:55) Yeah, she and she but she's responsible,
(8:58) right, for the choice that she made, the
(9:01) marriage that she and she's she comes
(9:02) out publicly and tells young women the
(9:04) same thing. I'm
(9:06) I'm totally responsible not for what
(9:08) happened to me,
(9:10) but for the choices that I made which
(9:11) led to the results of this happening to
(9:13) me.
(9:14) Was her first husband always a loser or
(9:16) did he go down a
(9:17) he was a [ __ ] he was a dirt bag and
(9:19) he lied to her, right? All that. But
(9:22) still,
(9:23) the ultimate responsibility lies on her
(9:26) for the choice that she made. You know
(9:28) what I mean? And there's no getting
(9:30) around that. But when people recognize
(9:33) that they've made a bad decision and
(9:35) that they're culpable for the bad
(9:36) decision, they rectify it. Nobody gives
(9:38) them push back. They're like, "You know
(9:40) what? Great. You [ __ ] up. You move
(9:42) past it." Nobody really cares. It's only
(9:44) when they're like, "I'm a helpless
(9:47) victim. This just happened to me. This
(9:49) penis came out of nowhere and inserted
(9:52) itself in me and then and got me
(9:54) pregnant through no fault of my own."
(9:57) That's when people are like, "No, you
(9:59) know, let's maybe re-evaluate this and
(10:02) just notate that promiscuity in women,
(10:05) generally speaking, really, really,
(10:07) really bad." Um, even one bad decision,
(10:11) like my wife's not promiscuous. Not even
(10:13) close. Right? If you were to take um
(10:18) well, I guess I won't get into all that,
(10:19) but yeah, not not even close. Um, some
(10:23) of these women have had sex with, you
(10:26) know, more uh men than my wife's ever
(10:29) been with in two days. You know what I
(10:32) mean?
(10:32) Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's disturbing. And
(10:34) they don't, it's not natural for them.
(10:35) They don't enjoy it. I don't think it's
(10:37) natural for anyone. Like Mley Crew on
(10:40) tour for their second album, [ __ ]
(10:43) like Five Chicks a Night. That's a gay
(10:45) lifestyle and it's a miserable
(10:47) lifestyle.
(10:48) There's no joy in that.
(10:49) Yeah. Well, I always ask like if you
(10:51) were to if I were to create a world
(10:55) where every man you had sex with, okay,
(10:57) you you you had a kid, no matter what.
(11:01) Every new man you had sex with. If I
(11:03) applied that rule to my wife, she'd have
(11:06) less children now. Okay. Less children
(11:09) than she currently has. How many would
(11:11) you have?
(11:14) 500.
(11:15) Right. enough where you could swim to
(11:17) the top of this room through the babies,
(11:20) right? It
(11:20) would be a zombie apocalypse movie.
(11:22) Well, but but the thing is is like no
(11:24) culpability.
(11:26) My wife's first one to tell you totally
(11:28) culpable. I made terrible decisions. I
(11:30) had [ __ ] parents. They gave me the bad
(11:32) advice. They let me move in with my
(11:33) boyfriend at 16. All right. [ __ ]
(11:36) insane. [ __ ] insane.
(11:39) They're the hippie boomer dumb asses.
(11:41) Okay. Free love. All this [ __ ] But
(11:44) ultimately,
(11:45) you know, now that
(11:46) Are you friends with them?
(11:48) Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, one of them. One
(11:50) of them. You know, they're all divorced,
(11:52) right?
(11:52) Right. Yeah.
(11:52) All divorced. All a mess. But I mean,
(11:55) they invented divorce, the boomers.
(11:56) Yeah. I've talked with I've talked with
(11:58) her dad and he's like, "Yeah, stupid.
(12:00) [ __ ] stupid. I don't know what the
(12:01) [ __ ] I was thinking." And I was like, "I
(12:02) don't know what the [ __ ] you were
(12:03) thinking either." But she But she's
(12:05) right. Now then, when you know she's 16,
(12:08) right? parents have a little bit of
(12:10) culpability there.
(12:11) But but external there
(12:13) 16 is a child.
(12:14) Yeah, it is. But external to that,
(12:17) right? Um you know, ultimately women
(12:22) have to be held responsible and stop
(12:23) being inanfanalized
(12:25) for their decision-m. They make stupid
(12:28) [ __ ] decisions sometimes. And we need
(12:30) to point out, look, you made a stupid
(12:33) [ __ ] decision. Stop pretending you
(12:35) didn't. Stop pretending you're a [ __ ]
(12:37) hero because you made a stupid ass
(12:39) decision. Stop it. You [ __ ] up and
(12:42) it's all right that you [ __ ] up. But
(12:44) now, how do you fix the [ __ ] up? That's
(12:47) what we're expected to do.
(12:49) Who's ever come to you and been like,
(12:50) "Oh, it's okay, Gavin. I know you [ __ ]
(12:52) up, but it's okay." Never happened in
(12:54) your life.
(12:54) Never one time.
(12:56) No. It's in fact, it's usually
(12:57) magnified.
(12:58) Yeah.
(12:59) Like, you don't know how much you [ __ ]
(13:01) up, you [ __ ] idiot.
(13:02) You Yeah. You have no clue.
(13:04) I don't know. I'm kind of optimistic
(13:06) about where things are going. I I know
(13:08) Trump is going to win the election. I've
(13:11) offered to eat a live mouse if he
(13:12) doesn't. That's how sure I am.
(13:15) He's not going to There's no way.
(13:16) Absolutely. Landslide. It's going to be
(13:18) too big to rig.
(13:20) No way.
(13:21) All right. Well, then I'm eating a
(13:22) mouse,
(13:22) bro. That's a You really made that bet?
(13:25) Yeah.
(13:26) You think they're going to let
(13:26) be alive? I'm going to bite its head off
(13:28) blood everywhere.
(13:28) You think they're really going to let
(13:29) him back in? They stole it from him the
(13:31) first time.
(13:32) Yeah, they had CO as a catalyst. They
(13:34) won't have CO this time.
(13:37) And
(13:38) what if what if the vaccine was all the
(13:40) um made them all Manurion candidates?
(13:43) So they just
(13:47) they just put have a lever at home.
(13:49) Yeah. They just they just like they got
(13:51) the B. Okay. It's Biden and they just
(13:53) like
(13:55) here. This is going to sound terrible,
(13:57) but uh
(13:59) there was something there was some
(14:02) something went viral on Twitter and it
(14:03) was like ultimate turn on. It's when
(14:06) she's racist or when she likes Hitler or
(14:08) something like that.
(14:09) And everyone was saying that like it's a
(14:11) cool thing if a hot chick likes Hitler.
(14:14) Now, no one literally means uh I want to
(14:16) gas Jews or whatever by that. What it
(14:19) really means is she's controversial and
(14:21) not uptight and edgy and redpilled and
(14:25) funny. It's really what it means. If
(14:27) someone says they're racist on Twitter
(14:29) and it's a chick, what she really means
(14:31) is I'm funny and I'm not uptight. And
(14:34) you're seeing a lot more of that of edgy
(14:36) humor
(14:37) on and Twitter like Google's gone. You
(14:40) can't look up anything on Google, but
(14:41) you look up Twitter. If there like the
(14:44) example I always use, there was a
(14:45) stabbing in Ireland and every time I
(14:48) looked on Google, it was Irish national
(14:50) involved in knife attack. I'm like, what
(14:52) happened? You go to Twitter, he's
(14:54) Syrian, he's been here for a year.
(14:56) Here's his face. Here's the 8-year-old
(14:58) he stabbed. Here's his face. And this is
(15:00) where they lived and this is what
(15:01) happened. So, the news is getting out
(15:03) there. When I was a teenager and I heard
(15:06) the Black Wall Street myth about how we
(15:08) burned down Black Wall Street, I didn't
(15:10) have anything to counter that. So, I
(15:13) went, "Oh, turns out we sucked and we
(15:15) burnt down Black Wall Street."
(15:16) Not really what happened.
(15:18) Not even close. And now, you know, a
(15:20) 16-year-old gets told that. And they can
(15:22) go look it up and see, oh, no, it was a
(15:24) race riot based on a a sexual assault
(15:28) and uh a town burned down.
(15:30) So, I I don't know. I think there's I
(15:33) think young people today and don't they
(15:34) say that 18 to 25s are like 25%
(15:38) conservative and that hasn't happened
(15:40) since the '8s.
(15:41) Well, the sex shift is it's like night
(15:43) and day. So, women are overwhelmingly
(15:46) moving more towards progressivism and
(15:48) young men are moving overwhelmingly
(15:50) towards conservatism.
(15:51) Oh, yeah. I heard that's because of
(15:53) social media because the algorithm gives
(15:55) you what you want so you end up more
(15:58) you.
(15:59) Yeah. Well, there's there's some truth
(16:01) to that. There's It's also just because
(16:03) um
(16:03) men are smarter.
(16:05) Yeah. Well, and they they look around
(16:10) and they're [ __ ] they're pretty [ __ ]
(16:11) mad. Like they're pretty pissed off.
(16:14) Like look, this kind of sucks. Why are
(16:16) all these [ __ ] women [ __ ] Why am I
(16:18) at you know in high school at 15 and the
(16:21) captain of the cheerleading squad at 18
(16:23) has an only fans? That's [ __ ] up.
(16:25) Yeah.
(16:25) What a way to ruin your dream, right?
(16:28) What a way to ruin your perception of
(16:30) reality.
(16:31) So yeah, they move over to the right and
(16:33) now you know it's not like it was even
(16:36) uh 10 years ago or even 5 years ago.
(16:39) Shows like yours on censored all these
(16:41) alternative media platforms, they are
(16:43) actually beginning to finally gain a
(16:45) little bit of steam.
(16:46) Yeah. When I was young, we had to like
(16:48) exchange fanzines via the mail if you
(16:52) wanted any sort of, you know,
(16:54) alternative
(16:55) alternative anything. And that was a
(16:57) pain in the ass. And it was very little.
(17:00) There was like five answer me, sewer
(17:03) [ __ ] [ __ ] There was like five zenes
(17:06) that you would exchange and they came
(17:08) out once a month. Now it's
(17:11) piles of like you couldn't watch all the
(17:13) content on censored.tv
(17:15) to that one network. You'd be watching
(17:17) six hours a day. You wouldn't have a
(17:18) life, right?
(17:18) And that's there's, you know, there's
(17:20) cozy. There's
(17:21) And is it getting bigger or smaller?
(17:24) It's getting bigger, right?
(17:25) Yeah. Absolutely. And that's well that's
(17:26) the thing is the reason it is YouTube um
(17:30) and Twitch and all these places they
(17:32) don't want politics on YouTube.
(17:34) No [ __ ] way. They they want kittens
(17:36) and they want people with cute nails and
(17:39) they they're doing their cute nails and
(17:41) glitter and all the [ __ ] in the
(17:44) world except politics because politics
(17:46) costs them ad revenue and nothing else
(17:48) does. Politics controversial. It costs
(17:50) ad revenue. um PE, you know, these big
(17:54) companies will pull their ads out of any
(17:56) of these Google algorithms that'll cost
(17:58) them hundreds of millions of dollars.
(18:00) So, they don't give a [ __ ] if a creator
(18:01) makes them a million, two, $4 million a
(18:04) year. They don't give a [ __ ] They'll
(18:05) they'll throw them out in a second if it
(18:07) has the potential to cost them one of
(18:09) these big ad revenue players. So, they
(18:11) don't want any politics on YouTube. They
(18:13) want any politics on any major platform.
(18:15) They're trying to move all that [ __ ] off
(18:17) platform. So guys who spearheaded that,
(18:19) who started getting these alternative
(18:20) media sites together ahead of time,
(18:22) they're going to really benefit from
(18:24) that in the next 5, 10 years because
(18:25) it's just going to get worse and worse.
(18:27) Yeah. Yeah. So, and it was very hard to
(18:30) make our site. We had to employ hackers
(18:31) to and it's still it just went down last
(18:34) week in Canada. I hear British people
(18:36) saying they can't process their credit
(18:38) card payments. So, it's it's a daily
(18:40) hassle to make this thing exist, but
(18:43) it's existing. And I don't know, I when
(18:46) I talk to young people, I I get
(18:48) inspired. The Zoomers are funnier than
(18:52) me. They are smarter than I was at that
(18:55) age. I feel pretty optimistic about the
(18:57) future.
(18:58) Except like one in four though
(19:04) or whatever they are.
(19:05) Like let's take it with a little bit of
(19:06) a grain of salt, right? Well, it'll be a
(19:09) male lesbian with a woman who identifies
(19:13) as as a dude. And you're like, "Yeah,
(19:15) you're a heterosexual couple,
(19:17) by the way, just in case you don't
(19:18) know."
(19:19) Yeah. In case you didn't know,
(19:20) like GG gorgeous. You know her?
(19:22) Oh, he has a dick.
(19:24) I know.
(19:25) And his wife has a So, he [ __ ] her with
(19:29) his penis. You're heterosexual. Welcome.
(19:32) Yeah. You just didn't know that.
(19:34) All aboard.
(19:35) Yeah. You just didn't know that. Even if
(19:36) you wear a dress, you went so gay.
(19:39) Yeah, you went back straight.
(19:41) You met us at the base.
(19:45) Talk about horseshoe theory. Now, now it
(19:48) goes with the homos too.
(19:49) Hi, fellow ho. [ __ ] you.
(19:51) Yeah, that's right. Well, it's so funny
(19:52) to me though. Um,
(19:55) I mean, that is the the rate though.
(19:56) It's like one in four these zoomers
(19:58) identify.
(19:59) It's just it's fashion. That's like
(20:00) saying one in four is goth.
(20:02) It's women.
(20:03) Yeah,
(20:04) it's women. When you look at that one
(20:05) and four number, you start breaking it
(20:07) down by sex. Guess how much? It's like
(20:09) 70% women.
(20:10) Yeah. Well, I think it's because we know
(20:14) white people are horrible and you can't
(20:16) say you're black.
(20:17) Yeah.
(20:18) So, what do you do? You say you're trans
(20:19) and now you're out of the white group,
(20:22) right?
(20:22) And you're not responsible for slavery
(20:24) or anything. You're you're an
(20:26) independent cool person.
(20:27) Now you're in the other category. You're
(20:30) absolved of all your sins.
(20:31) That's right. That's right. Yes. You're
(20:34) good. You have now entered into the
(20:36) transcorr identity. You're fine. Right
(20:39) this way. What can we get for you?
(20:41) How do these poor bastards get laid? It
(20:43) just
(20:45) they don't. Haven't you seen the latest
(20:48) uh the latest polls on on men who are
(20:50) virgins? The the calling it the incel
(20:54) crisis because they're not getting laid.
(20:58) They're jerking off. Yeah.
(20:59) To only fans.
(21:00) Yeah. And they're not getting married
(21:01) young either. So like these are this is
(21:04) a really bad time to be a young man.
(21:07) Yeah.
(21:07) It's a really bad time to be a young
(21:09) man. I feel like what's happening is the
(21:11) millennials are becoming like the
(21:12) boomers who are just like give me that
(21:14) [ __ ] and [ __ ] them. [ __ ] that generation
(21:16) coming up.
(21:17) Yeah.
(21:17) It's a really bad way to go.
(21:19) Well, I'm of two minds about I get a lot
(21:20) of [ __ ] for saying this, but on the one
(21:22) hand, yes, you're right. It is
(21:23) impossible to buy a house. Yes, you are
(21:25) told you suck [ __ ] every day. Uh yes,
(21:28) you know, you you you're saddled with
(21:30) debt for a useless degree. All of that
(21:32) is true, but at the same time, I'm like,
(21:35) suck it up. Like, try being English in
(21:38) Quebec in your teens. It is not possible
(21:42) to find a job. You could be a bike
(21:44) messenger in the winter.
(21:45) You can plant trees in northern Quebec,
(21:48) but you're a secondass citizen there.
(21:50) Your children cannot go to an English
(21:52) school.
(21:52) So, you're we're controlling how your
(21:55) children think, and we we figured it
(21:58) out,
(22:00) I think. Um,
(22:02) I think when it comes to resource, I
(22:05) have noticed just in my lifetime that it
(22:09) seemed like every single time I would
(22:10) upgrade, I'd get a better job and it
(22:13) would lead to more money or this or that
(22:16) every time I looked at the material
(22:18) pricing around me, right, I could never
(22:20) outpace it. I could just never quite get
(22:23) in front of that. You know what I mean?
(22:25) and it'd be like, "Oh, if you're making
(22:26) 20 bucks an hour, um, man, if I can get
(22:30) to that $30 an hour."
(22:32) Yeah.
(22:32) You know what I mean? I'd really get
(22:33) ahead of this. And by the time you'd
(22:35) reach that goal, you'd be like, "I'm not
(22:36) getting ahead of this, though.
(22:38) This is a [ __ ] mess."
(22:39) Well, that's why you had to do those
(22:40) night shifts.
(22:41) Yeah. Well, that's why I did whatever I
(22:43) needed to do to get ahead. You know what
(22:44) I mean? And
(22:45) I wish these young people realized, too,
(22:47) that if you want to make money, have
(22:50) babies. It puts a fire under your ass
(22:53) and the next thing you know you're
(22:54) [ __ ]
(22:55) and you got skills and everything else
(22:57) because by necessity. But there's
(22:58) another reason for that too.
(23:00) The other reason is is that there's a
(23:02) social status with having a family that
(23:05) other men have a lot of respect for. And
(23:07) you're a really safe bet for a person
(23:09) who's hiring if you have a family
(23:11) because you probably won't leave. You
(23:12) need your income.
(23:14) Oh, right.
(23:14) You need your income. And so you're
(23:16) going to show up every day so that you
(23:18) can support your wife and your kids. you
(23:20) become a much safer bet. You can't just
(23:21) pack up and move the next day and you
(23:24) have a higher social status. So, much
(23:27) more likely to hire you if you have a
(23:28) family uh because they know that you're
(23:30) going to show up because you need the
(23:32) money and you're probably going to do a
(23:34) good job and try to work your way up
(23:35) because that that's your option
(23:38) and you're going to get in [ __ ] with
(23:39) your wife if you get fired,
(23:40) right? You're going to get [ __ ] up.
(23:41) You're a much safer bet. The turnover
(23:43) rate for married men much lower than
(23:45) turnover rate for single guys. Single
(23:46) guys can be like, "Well, I want to be a
(23:48) railroad worker now. Goodbye. You know
(23:50) what I mean? I'm going to go work on an
(23:51) oil rig. See you later. Office job.
(23:53) I met a pretty girl and she's going back
(23:55) to Ohio.
(23:56) I'm gone.
(23:57) Yep.
(23:57) Yeah.
(23:58) And there's also the the social status
(24:00) end of it, too. Uh society generally
(24:04) speaking, not everybody, but generally
(24:06) speaking, society treats men with a
(24:08) family a little bit better than men who
(24:10) don't have a family.
(24:11) It's just a better vibe.
(24:13) Yeah. It's and that's what I tried more
(24:15) trustworthy
(24:16) with my show and that that's what I
(24:17) wrote a book about death of cool. I was
(24:19) like I get it party years awesome but
(24:22) you started stealing liquor from your
(24:24) parents when you were 14. You're 24 now.
(24:26) That's 10 years of decadence. Time to
(24:29) put close that chapter and start your
(24:31) real life. And then once you get married
(24:33) and have kids, you're like I was just I
(24:36) wasn't even a person.
(24:37) I was a [ __ ] degenerate scumbag.
(24:38) I didn't exist. I'm born now. I'm
(24:41) starting an actual life now.
(24:43) But imagine what it used to be like for
(24:44) for people when they were getting
(24:46) married 18, 19, 20, and that was common.
(24:49) You know what I mean? They didn't really
(24:50) have time for the degen years.
(24:52) Yeah. It wasn't It was real. It was fun.
(24:54) It wasn't real fun.
(24:55) Yeah. It was just real.
(24:57) It was [ __ ] It was real.
(25:01) All right. How are you doing for money
(25:03) these days?
(25:04) Uh, you know, we get by. We're not um
(25:09) to say that the various algorithms on
(25:13) like YouTube and the places where we
(25:14) mostly do our show, The Crucible,
(25:17) they don't like us at all. And um so
(25:22) yeah, that's that's tough. But um we're
(25:24) able to go on shows like this and
(25:26) advertise that, you know, and uh get out
(25:28) to new audiences and then bring our
(25:30) audience over to that show. So that's
(25:32) pretty helpful. But I mean, as far as
(25:34) cash flow goes, like we're not
(25:36) definitely not rolling in it. You know
(25:37) what I mean? But we're doing okay. And
(25:39) okay is okay enough for right now,
(25:41) right? You know,
(25:42) you're not doing as well as destiny.
(25:44) No. No. We're not raking in millions of
(25:47) dollars a year. No.
(25:48) Playing video games and letting people
(25:50) [ __ ] our wives, unfortunately.
(25:51) Funny that we're we spend so much of the
(25:53) show talking about meritocracy and then
(25:55) you have a dork like him making millions
(25:59) being a boob.
(26:00) Yeah. being a complete a complete
(26:02) degenerate cummer. [ __ ] Well, the thing
(26:05) is is like and what they do if they
(26:08) don't like you, if that like whole
(26:10) Destiny crew cuz he has minions and
(26:12) everything else or other creators,
(26:14) they'll mass flag your channel off the
(26:16) internet, mass report you, they'll mass
(26:19) report you to payment providers, they'll
(26:21) dox you, they'll do whatever they need
(26:23) to do to stay on top. They don't give a
(26:24) [ __ ]
(26:25) It's revenge of the nerds.
(26:26) Yeah, it's totally revenge of the
(26:27) [ __ ] nerds. in the algorithm. If you
(26:29) just type in Destiny's # Destiny, you
(26:32) know, inside of the YouTube algorithm
(26:34) cuz you're reacting to a video, it
(26:36) instantly picks the video up.
(26:39) Really?
(26:39) Instantly picks it up because they're
(26:41) pushing this [ __ ]
(26:42) people actually work at Google and
(26:44) YouTube. They're fat lossers who resent
(26:46) any kind of, you know, alpha anything
(26:50) and they want revenge and they're trans
(26:52) and they're hideous and they're in there
(26:54) controlling the American conversation
(26:56) and so much of them and this is true of
(26:58) a lot of the left. It's just
(26:59) spite. I've always said that's the gas
(27:01) that powers their engine is this
(27:03) well they [ __ ] hate me. I mean I'
(27:04) I've tangled with Destiny. I've probably
(27:06) debated this guy seven, eight times.
(27:08) Crushed him many, many times because
(27:10) he's a [ __ ] idiot. You ever want to
(27:12) know how to beat destiny in a debate?
(27:13) For all of you out there who are
(27:14) aspiring debaters, just ask him to
(27:16) repeat what he just said.
(27:19) Really, he can't do it because he's on
(27:21) five and he has methm mouth.
(27:25) If you ask him to just repeat back what
(27:27) he just got done do, he can't he can't
(27:29) even repeat his last argument cuz his
(27:32) head is zipping his lateral.
(27:33) Yeah. His mouth is moving, right? Cuz
(27:35) his jaw isn't hinged. It looks like the
(27:37) um Have you ever remember the old
(27:39) Godzilla movies?
(27:41) Uhhuh.
(27:41) That you know how the lip sync was never
(27:43) synced up correctly? So it'd be like
(27:45) look it's Godzilla.
(27:47) That's what he does,
(27:48) right? That's what he does except his
(27:50) his jaw just hinges. You know, so he's
(27:52) like, "Well, actually, due to the
(27:54) economic status of the"
(27:57) and you're like, "Dude, you all you got
(28:00) to do is say, can you repeat your
(28:02) argument back so I make sure I get it
(28:04) correct and he'll make a completely new
(28:06) argument cuz you can't remember what he
(28:08) just said 5 minutes ago because of the
(28:09) [ __ ] vance that he's on."
(28:12) That whole generation is tweaked out on
(28:14) [ __ ] speed. Watching porn, [ __ ]
(28:18) making millions, being [ __ ]
(28:22) but at the same time, I talked to a lot
(28:24) of them and they really have their head
(28:25) screwed on, right? So, I don't know how
(28:28) to how I feel about zoomers.
(28:30) They're doomed and smart at the same
(28:32) time.
(28:33) For me, it's like I wonder about this
(28:35) generation alpha. That's what's going to
(28:37) be interesting to me because the
(28:39) decadence by the time the Zoomers are
(28:41) having family and having kids is going
(28:42) to be like through the [ __ ] roof. The
(28:44) kind of decadence where you like walk in
(28:46) and you go like half the people in the
(28:48) room are trans. You know, maybe a guy
(28:50) suck another guy off over here in this
(28:52) corner. You know what I mean? Republic.
(28:54) Yeah. It's going to be like insane. And
(28:56) then I'm just like maybe maybe
(28:58) Generation Alpha is going to be way more
(28:59) base than you think. They're just going
(29:01) to be a little bit more awesome than
(29:03) anybody could have predicted.
(29:04) Yeah, I think so. I see it in their
(29:07) comedy. They're They seem to be slightly
(29:10) more advanced than everyone else. All
(29:13) right. Well, it was great talking to
(29:15) you, buddy.
(29:15) You, too, man. Really appreciate it. And
(29:18) to everyone at home, go [ __ ] yourself.
