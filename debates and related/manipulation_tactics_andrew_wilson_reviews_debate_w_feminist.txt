(0:00) no I did not go to school for four years
(0:03) and build a platform to be talked to
(0:06) like this So yeah So we she starts So
(0:10) this is where you start to see the
(0:13) um emotional breakdowns My response to
(0:16) this of course is to mock her That's my
(0:20) response right it's instant You go girl
(0:23) right i'm not I don't care about your
(0:25) pedigree I'm not there to uh engage with
(0:30) however you think your pedigree needs to
(0:32) be treated I'm there to engage with your
(0:34) arguments and engage in a
(0:36) debate Next day I had a debate with
(0:41) Kylie Now I had thoroughly gone through
(0:44) all of Kylie's uh Tik Toks understood
(0:48) pretty well what her arguments were
(0:49) going to be and the stats that she based
(0:52) her arguments on which were [ __ ]
(0:56) Now what was really interesting in the
(0:58) Kylie debate is that that is a complete
(1:01) and total breakdown step by step of
(1:05) female manipulation including trying to
(1:08) lay the groundwork what clips were or
(1:10) were not going to be allowed to go out I
(1:12) get into the studio Kylie was sitting I
(1:16) don't know some somewhere outside by uh
(1:18) by the door uh they come down get us up
(1:21) in the studio and we uh I go and sit
(1:24) down in the chair so that I can get in
(1:26) the framing and all that right and when
(1:28) I do she goes over to Brian and tells
(1:31) Brian Brian says "You need to sign this
(1:34) appearance release," which I've signed
(1:36) You know what I mean and she was like
(1:38) "Well what's it say?" And he's like
(1:40) "Well you can read it It's just a pretty
(1:42) standard appearance release." Uh she
(1:44) says that
(1:47) uh she's involved in a lawsuit currently
(1:49) with some other show or something like
(1:51) this because she didn't like how she was
(1:54) framed or something like this She was
(1:56) and then she brought up that there was
(1:58) some type of AI some artificial
(2:00) intelligence or some [ __ ] uh which was
(2:03) releasing clips about her or something
(2:05) like that right i don't remember the
(2:06) exact context but she was already
(2:08) talking about how she sued some other
(2:10) show So I was not
(2:13) surprised when Brian said that she's
(2:16) threatening to sue him That did not
(2:17) shock me a bit That's how she basically
(2:20) opened But let's review this There's so
(2:24) much uh female manipulation tactics here
(2:26) It's unfucking believable When we get to
(2:29) my opening she opens first
(2:32) Okay Thank
(2:37) Andrew if you'd like to give yours now
(2:40) Yeah Um just a second Let me back up
(2:43) here One thing I wanted to address right
(2:45) in my opening I've been going through
(2:47) Kylie's
(2:48) videos and she knows so much which is
(2:51) not So this is a big bait and switch
(2:54) This happens often I think I pointed
(2:56) this out to the whatever podcast many
(2:58) times especially when it comes to
(2:59) sociology and psychology How often they
(3:01) are wrong And here's how they're wrong
(3:03) Most often what they do is they take
(3:06) studies which are recently published
(3:08) They point to those data sets and say
(3:09) because this is right now the most
(3:11) current data set we have it's true and
(3:14) then operate as though those things are
(3:16) in reality true when they're not Kenzie
(3:19) says for instance on gender quotas
(3:21) according to and she she cites this and
(3:24) many feminists site this 2015 are you
(3:26) talking about so immediately so I'm
(3:29) citing this uh Kenzie study
(3:32) immediately Kylie interrupts the opening
(3:37) statement Immediately I didn't interrupt
(3:39) her once by the way She
(3:42) immediately interrupts the opening
(3:44) statement
(3:47) It was designed for control of the
(3:48) conversation She's pushing the
(3:49) boundaries and seeing what she can get
(3:51) away with and what she can't get away
(3:52) with right from the beginning Jim Bob
(3:55) agreed with me that the weird guy's name
(3:56) is Count Wakovit What the [ __ ] that's
(4:00) why she
(4:01) interrupted the the Kinsey study
(4:05) Yeah The Kinsey study which you cite
(4:07) right and most feminists site anyway She
(4:10) interrupts it
(4:12) again as well She interrupts it multiple
(4:15) times
(4:17) Now this is pretty uh pretty common
(4:20) right you'll see these from these uh Tik
(4:22) Tocker lunatics right uh even if you
(4:25) want to jump in just let the other
(4:27) person finish speaking If somebody's
(4:29) going on a uh monologue and they're
(4:31) filibustering I'll try to get them to
(4:34) wrap up But just by the way don't make
(4:36) fun of me for being um for being buff
(4:39) here
(4:41) okay then don't make fun of me for that
(4:43) The camera adds 100 pounds
(4:46) If they're making a
(4:47) point 150 lbs camera ads 150 lbs Let
(4:51) them finish No I did not go to school
(4:53) for four years and build a platform to
(4:56) be talked to like this So yeah So we She
(5:00) starts So this is where you start to see
(5:03) the
(5:04) um emotional
(5:06) breakdowns So the first thing is is it's
(5:08) an appeal
(5:10) He's saying "I'm super I'm super
(5:14) educated right i'm super educated."
(5:19) And so because I'm super educated
(5:23) um you know I have a a degree or a
(5:27) pedigree which needs to be
(5:30) respected right it needs to be respected
(5:32) because of blah blah blah blah blah
(5:36) So my response to this of course is to
(5:40) mock
(5:42) her That's my response right it's
(5:45) instant You go girl right i'm not I
(5:48) don't care about your pedigree I'm not
(5:50) there to uh engage with however you
(5:54) think your pedigree needs to be treated
(5:57) I'm there to engage with your arguments
(5:58) and engage in a debate
(6:01) So generally speaking when I use mockery
(6:04) like this it deescalates rather than
(6:07) escalates once people realize whatever
(6:10) your [ __ ] [ __ ] is I'm not going
(6:12) to put up with it They actually
(6:13) generally lose interest in that and you
(6:15) can get back to the debate
(6:18) away from the microphone right now And I
(6:19) would encourage you to get your guest
(6:20) under control I'm going to take two
(6:22) minutes so you can ask him questions if
(6:24) you'd like and I will be right back So
(6:25) this was again control right
(6:28) you will do this for me Here's what's
(6:32) going to happen And if this doesn't
(6:35) happen there's going to be a serious
(6:37) consequence cuz you run the show I just
(6:41) won't be back And I don't give a [ __ ]
(6:44) Right So again disarming
(6:46) tactic right whatever your threat is I'm
(6:49) here to help Whatever it is your threat
(6:51) is that you're trying to hit me with In
(6:53) this case I I'll make myself scarce In
(6:56) this case it'll be you're not going to
(6:58) be allowed to engage with me I don't
(7:00) care about that It's irrelevant to
(7:03) me It literally means nothing to
(7:09) me Wait a second If you don't do this
(7:12) then I'm going to leave I don't care And
(7:15) by the way for those of you who are
(7:16) watching who are men when women use this
(7:19) threat on you in your personal life just
(7:21) let them
(7:23) go Same way Tell them the same exact
(7:26) thing Okay [ __ ] leave I don't
(7:29) care Call it
(7:32) out See if they actually do or if
(7:35) they're just [ __ ] testing
(7:38) you Do you do this or else call the
(7:43) bluff [ __ ] do it then I don't
(7:47) care Have a debate And I listen to your
(7:50) whining Do you want to have a debate or
(7:51) not right So here I'm explaining
(7:54) something which is super
(7:57) important Right look I'm not here to
(7:59) listen to your [ __ ]
(8:01) [ __ ] I'm here to have a debate Do
(8:03) you want to do that or don't you want to
(8:04) do that all right I I'm not going to be
(8:06) talked to like this So there we go And
(8:09) how was she talked
(8:10) to what did I actually say there that
(8:12) was so
(8:13) bad while all these people get upset and
(8:17) say that I was being super mean Try to
(8:19) get them to wrap up Tell me what I said
(8:21) here that was actually that was actually
(8:24) wrong incorrect or mean in some way
(8:28) No I did not go to school for four years
(8:31) and build a platform to be talked to
(8:33) like this So I will be walking away from
(8:35) the microphone right now and I would
(8:36) encourage you to get your guest under
(8:37) control I'm going to take two minutes so
(8:39) you can ask him questions if you'd like
(8:41) and I will be right back You run the
(8:42) show I just won't be back and 30 seconds
(8:46) I don't give a [ __ ] What do I care i'm
(8:48) here to have a debate and I listen to
(8:50) your whining Do you want to have a
(8:51) debate or not right So the the idea here
(8:53) is just do you want to do this or don't
(8:55) you want to do this whatever your
(8:57) threats are just don't mean anything to
(8:59) me Do you want to do this or not all
(9:00) right I I'm not going to be talked to
(9:02) like this How was she talked
(9:05) to how was she talked to which was
(9:07) actually bad
(9:13) How do you want to just take a little
(9:16) two-minute breather you want to take a
(9:17) two-minute breather this is feminism
(9:19) You're the strong woman You're the
(9:21) strong
(9:22) woman
(9:25) Really strong woman I will not be talked
(9:28) to Like what what did I even say
(9:31) um you know I would
(9:34) uh I will not be talked to like that
(9:37) Yeah you will What are you talking about
(9:39) what are you It's a
(9:43) debate Maybe we'll we then I have to
(9:45) listen to her
(9:47) Um she walks away for two minutes then
(9:50) she comes back
(9:55) Real women don't abort their children
(9:56) lad Uh then real women don't abort their
(10:00) children So she starts by telling me
(10:02) what real men do or don't do when she
(10:04) finally gets back to the
(10:07) table This is also you'll see this in
(10:10) most debates I have with feminists them
(10:12) moving into what real men are or aren't
(10:14) Then time it if she's in the middle of
(10:16) Yeah time it Give us 60 seconds a piece
(10:18) Now remember I
(10:20) suggested the 60-second rule right here
(10:23) If she if if it will make her more
(10:25) comfortable then we can do uh 60-second
(10:29) intervals
(10:31) Uh yeah we I suggested that You could do
(10:34) that Yeah I'll I'll propose that to her
(10:35) Just do 60 But I mean I'm I'm fine with
(10:37) keeping it open but just if if you're
(10:41) talking I'll and she interrupts you I'll
(10:43) tell her not to Mhm But if you can just
(10:45) try to let her uh finish Yeah But when
(10:48) they when when anybody does the [ __ ]
(10:50) of like I'm speaking you know what I
(10:52) mean of course there's going to be some
(10:53) Yeah But try to try to let her finish if
(10:55) you can but Yeah Let's do 60sec back and
(10:57) forth That's fine with me As long as
(10:59) Remember I suggested this There's some
(11:01) boundaries Yeah You want to do that 60
(11:03) seconds back and forth That works Or if
(11:06) you guys want we could give it another
(11:07) shot at just keeping it open combo Um
(11:10) sure When we do that if it if it the
(11:13) interruptions continue you guys feel
(11:15) like you're not I would like to just
(11:16) point out that Wait wait wait We have to
(11:18) set the rules first No more talking
(11:26) Yes we have to set the rules first No
(11:29) more
(11:31) talking Again uh gambit for a power play
(11:35) of control where neither one of us
(11:38) actually have control in this situation
(11:40) the host and moderator has control
(11:42) ultimately over the
(11:44) situation but for some reason she feels
(11:47) that it's necessary to once again assert
(11:50) that she's in control
(11:54) We will do 60 seconds I'm supposed to be
(11:56) talked to like that though right no 60
(11:58) seconds back and forth I or I will leave
(12:00) 60 seconds back and forth or I will
(12:02) leave As though she was the one who
(12:03) suggested this
(12:06) but she never suggested it It was my
(12:09) suggestion
(12:10) for her
(12:12) comfort to give her six to do a
(12:14) 60-second back and
(12:16) forth Uh it's crazy because if you said
(12:18) that to me I'd say "Okay let's debate
(12:20) then." Um you'd beat me of course but
(12:23) your challenge would make me want to
(12:24) debate you even more
(12:26) Exactly But now she goes back to uh the
(12:30) hostage taking
(12:32) scenario Yeah And you know either you do
(12:35) this or else even though it wasn't even
(12:39) her suggestion it was mine But for some
(12:42) reason she needed it to be her idea She
(12:45) needed it to be her suggestion It
(12:48) couldn't be that Andrew was the one who
(12:50) suggested this for your comfort He's an
(12:53) evil patriarchist lunatic After all the
(12:56) case of the matter is she needed to be
(12:58) the one who suggested this and Brian was
(13:01) damn sure going to do it or else I'm so
(13:03) serious We signed an agreement if I
(13:05) leave I don't care So once again
(13:07) pointing this out I don't give a [ __ ]
(13:10) Your emot your emotional hostage taking
(13:12) means nothing to me Why do you think I
(13:14) care if you [ __ ] I'm not talking to
(13:15) you Hold on I'm not talking to you Okay
(13:18) What's your What's Go ahead What's your
(13:19) proposal my proposal if we don't do 60
(13:22) seconds back and forth I will walk out
(13:23) right now The agreement was that I
(13:24) appear It does not say that I have to
(13:25) stay for three hours So I will leave
(13:28) right now because I'm not going to be
(13:30) talked to like this I mean like what
(13:36) how was she talked
(13:38) to how was she talked to in even in a
(13:41) way that was particularly negative she
(13:43) had sat back down and just said "Yeah
(13:45) sure We'll do the 60-second back and
(13:46) forth." That would have been the end of
(13:48) it Couldn't do it Had to be this is
(13:51) going to be the terms I'm in control I'm
(13:53) in charge Or
(13:57) else what real men Real Here we go
(14:02) feminist moving into telling you what
(14:03) real men do or don't do
(14:07) You're going to tell me what a real man
(14:08) is well Andrew real women don't abort
(14:11) their children lady My See that's always
(14:14) the best one to hit them back with when
(14:15) they tell you what real men do or don't
(14:17) do Just hit them back with real women
(14:19) don't abort their children That tends to
(14:22) put them in a really bad mood very
(14:23) quickly because most of them have
(14:27) dad has the same political beliefs as
(14:29) you and he would never talk to a woman
(14:30) and my sister has the same political
(14:31) beliefs as you and she would never dare
(14:33) talk to a man like that Like what's your
(14:34) point exactly So this rejoinder is just
(14:37) pointing out doesn't matter if there's
(14:39) some male uh in your family who you
(14:41) would ascribe to for the perfection of
(14:43) male behavior I can make the same exact
(14:46) argument that my sister is the epitome
(14:49) of female behavior You're not acting
(14:51) like her Therefore you're not a real
(14:53) woman [ __ ] stupid right makes no
(14:55) sense It's nonsensical
(14:57) That makes no sense Andrew can you stop
(15:00) andrew that's really Oh god everything's
(15:02) disrespectful Stop Stop You're such a
(15:05) crybaby Andrew she was being a crybaby
(15:08) Stop In furtherance of ensuring that
(15:11) this debate actually
(15:13) occurs Let's set some ground rules We
(15:16) got to allow people to finish their
(15:18) points And uh Andrew maybe you've said
(15:22) some mocking things towards her
(15:24) No I have not mocked him at all
(15:27) She's not mocked me at all You're not a
(15:30) real man because of X That's not
(15:33) mocking right the idea that I was doing
(15:37) something which was not correct right
(15:40) form of mocking as
(15:41) well What these [ __ ] people do right
(15:45) they lie with a straight face
(15:47) constantly
(15:49) Constantly Her whole demeanor uh leading
(15:52) up to this is condescending or mockery
(15:54) not sure of the word while you were
(15:56) having your opening statement Well it
(15:59) wasn't just that Throughout the entire
(16:00) debate we see this over and over again
(16:02) Hey Jim Bob thanks for the raid to the
(16:04) Crucible I appreciate it Real men get
(16:07) all flustered and cry
(16:08) homophobe like Parker Yeah it's right No
(16:11) no no I have stood up for myself and I
(16:13) will not be mocked I have not said a
(16:15) word that is bad to you I talked to you
(16:16) about your family in Michigan I want to
(16:17) get to know you This isn't about
(16:19) anything mocking Yeah So that was an
(16:21) early disarming tactic by her when we
(16:24) were sitting at the table before the
(16:26) debate began She asked about my home
(16:29) life where I lived this type of thing
(16:31) Idol chitchat where I was of course nice
(16:33) to her Um there's no reason to be mean
(16:37) to anybody I wouldn't be mean to her in
(16:39) the debate if she hadn't been a
(16:41) completely insufferable [ __ ]
(16:44) But the disarming tactic often will
(16:46) happen of the it's called it's the
(16:49) getting to know you phase The idea there
(16:51) is and you see this from a lot of
(16:53) feminist and a lot of women who utilize
(16:55) manipulation tactics They're trying to
(16:58) express to you that they're secretly
(17:00) actually on your side They actually
(17:02) really care about you and you can tell
(17:05) because they took a vested interest in
(17:07) your life Now I know that that this is a
(17:10) double-edged sword and that most of the
(17:12) time that women are prying in order to
(17:14) get details of your personal life is so
(17:16) that they can later weaponize it against
(17:18) you That's most most often why these
(17:21) people do this especially those who are
(17:22) trained in psychology who are experts
(17:25) and trained experts at that point in the
(17:27) art of manipulation which I would
(17:30) express most psychology is the art of
(17:31) manipulation more than anything else
(17:34) Um that's why I always just whenever I
(17:38) make idol chatter I'm just kind of very
(17:39) to the point very nonchalant about it
(17:42) right uh because I understand that this
(17:44) is both a disarming tactic and a way to
(17:47) glean information for later use against
(17:50) you
