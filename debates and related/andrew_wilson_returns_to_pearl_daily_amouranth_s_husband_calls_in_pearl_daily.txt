(1:44) show you guys the documentary trailer So I've actually
(1:50) um me and Andrew Wilson's debate on actually here let me send him the Zoom
(1:57) We were kind of going back about the question What the heck there we go
(2:03) What's in it for men so let me show you guys the documentary trailer I just posted it today and
(2:11) yesterday on Twitter so we're going to react to this Okay
(2:17) Oh
(2:23) man Oh my gosh Hold on guys
(2:57) Okay bear with me Sorry guys
(3:02) Okay All right Now let's watch the trailer together
(3:12) this clip going viral online of a dozen women being asked the following question
(3:17) Do we need men most answered very quickly no because
(3:23) men are useless This headline from The Hill it caught my eye Most young men are single Most young
(3:30) women are not Young men have fallen faster than any demographic in America over the last 40 years It's a different
(3:36) world now Like we don't need men the way that they used to Don't need men The future is female
(3:43) Men and women are drifting further apart and society is crumbling because of it A
(3:50) fascinating debate has broken out about the value of merit You've kind of got the tradcon versus red pill thing This
(3:56) men's rights crowd that sometimes just goes too far the other way You need to stop acting like grown boys and infants
(4:02) and actually become men Marriage is a bond and it's a sacred bond It's a machine designed to extract resources
(4:08) from you Now many of the red pill have taken the position that it's bad for men to get married
(4:14) Hannah Pearl Davis or just pearly things One of the most controversial faces in
(4:20) all of the internet She goes on to say that marriage is a terrible deal for men Because if me and you were in a business
(4:26) contract you would never sign a contract where I am paid to leave Gee what could go wrong there 74% or something of
(4:33) divorces are initiated by women Men have everything to lose primarily their own children Men get killed by the courts
(4:40) and by divorce laws I had no idea that courts of family law were courts of equity not courts of law Because in
(4:46) family court you don't need evidence to accuse someone of abuse You need no evidence When you guys say get married
(4:51) young a lot of these men don't know what they're signing up for And you're not going to be there when their entire life falls apart I interview them on the
(4:58) other side I didn't meet my son until he was 15 months old How much did you spend trying to get him back on legal fees
(5:04) alone was about 200,000 Before you know it you're homeless You're literally just thrown out onto the street We absolutely
(5:10) reinforce bad behavior from women Wives are taught to leave their husbands and then daughters grow up without their
(5:16) fathers Family is the foundation of the society Every problem in society comes from single mother homes A lot of women
(5:22) will just chase this negative rabbit hole of happiness endless happiness Feminism's biggest failures is it lies
(5:27) to women We tell women to date as many guys as possible We tell them to put off family in a marriage You are allowed to
(5:32) leave your perfect husband You are allowed to end a relationship with a really great boyfriend Oh freeze your
(5:39) eggs Have an abortion What you're evil I don't think there's anything else in life that we actually ever go into
(5:44) preparing to fail Like if you have the mentality of this is going to go wrong and be pessimistic Naturally the outcome
(5:50) is going to be that it's going to fail anyway It's self-sabotage And that's the thing like women are so willing to leave marriages because they're not happy This
(5:57) is not about happiness The most important thing is the children And the problem is we have a modern society
(6:03) where it's me me my feelings Leave when I feel like it instead of doing what's best for the kids This myth that we live
(6:11) in an age of male privilege Where is my male privilege they think well men have all the rights They have all the power
(6:16) privileged patriarchal system that we have Why doesn't our society care about men's rights i have no friends no wife
(6:23) and no social life Men are alone in this situation Men are homeless Men are thinking about eating guns I've seen so
(6:29) many men on on the brink of suicide and they didn't do anything wrong How are you equal if the men are the ones that
(6:36) have to fight and die to defend the country the men are the ones that build and maintain all the infrastructure
(6:42) Women are helplessly dependent upon men The so-called deaths of despair from suicide overdose or alcohol three times
(6:50) higher among men than among women Culture is telling men you are no good You got to get your act together I think
(6:55) men have failed themselves What kind of a man are you what kind of a woman are you going to attract if men are in
(7:01) trouble so are women Everybody knows this is a huge problem but nobody wants to admit it Every single woman at the
(7:08) table said they wanted a man 500k 500k 300k 200k Am I crazy everything is really set up against you to fail as a
(7:14) man If men make less than women women don't want to marry them So you know who wants more economically and emotionally
(7:20) viable men women I don't want to be an independent woman anymore I don't want to be a strong
(7:26) independent woman I'm over it When is it going to be my turn where are we meeting the men that don't suck i can't keep
(7:32) having these same conversations The only s here is you Pearl You simp for me No I think I think you said for women She's a
(7:38) provocator She says stupid stuff But Pearl is right about this It's already happening It's just not out in the open
(7:43) yet Now it's just hookup culture is going to be our fairy tale ending because men don't want a wife and women can't find a husband The future if
(7:51) everybody follows your path is there is no future We go into population decline and our economy goes into decline
(7:57) Civilization will crumble The American story does not end well This is an existential crisis failing young men
(8:09) So the whole idea the whole question of this documentary is really you know all
(8:14) these commentators and this is kind of what inspired um the question I asked Andrew this weekend and we had a debate
(8:20) um where I just kept asking him the question what do men get out of marriage and I kept seeing all these like the
(8:27) smartest pe like people way smarter than me right and they're like why is the birth rate falling why is um why are men
(8:35) dropping out of the workforce why are men not going to school why aren't they
(8:40) making as much money like and these would be people that were so much smarter than me And I just keep asking
(8:47) the question what does he get and until conservatives the right the left uh
(8:55) whoever can answer that question men naturally do a costbenefit analysis And
(9:01) the trends are just going to keep going the way they're going until they can answer this question and have a good
(9:06) answer Um now I really want to finish this documentary Um we've put together a
(9:12) lot of the um footage the past few years Um the
(9:18) challenge was when we started when we collected all this footage we didn't really know what we were doing And if
(9:23) you go through this a lot of this kind of looks like low budget And my goal is
(9:29) I really want to refilm this um a lot of the interviews of of guys we already had in and they'd be willing to come back
(9:35) but just like a higher quality um a little bit more professional so it looks like a a Netflix level like a Netflix
(9:43) grade documentary The challenge is that's very very expensive Um the the quotes I've been
(9:49) given are half a million to a million dollars Now we've we're considering doing it
(9:56) inhouse but again you got to hire someone full-time to do that inhouse And when we
(10:02) were demonetized a year and a half to be honest guys it just really like um it just really sucked Like we really
(10:10) had to put this on pause for like a year and a half Um and and we put in so much work into it Was the unfortunate thing
(10:17) Um but so if you guys want to donate to this it's the link The GoFundMe is in
(10:24) the description If you have a a big donation that you want to make you can email me just pearly things@gmail.com
(10:30) Right now we're distributing directly Um we're in talks with some people to distribute through other platforms but
(10:36) right now we're just going to do it on our app the Audacity Network Um we're
(10:42) open to other opportunities That's fine But a lot of people that have asked me um have been asking about
(10:48) distribution Um but yeah if we want to get it done that's really what it's going to cost Um I think maybe for 100
(10:56) to like 200 um we could finish like because we need to get a full-time person on this and a
(11:03) lot of the good people are just expensive
(11:08) Um yeah So that's really that's really what we're doing with the
(11:14) documentary The I think right now we're at like 15,000 and we had a decent
(11:20) donation Someone donated directly So anyways the link to that's in the description if you want to donate All
(11:26) right Now we're going to talk to Andrew Wilson the 304
(11:32) Destroyer How's it going Andrew good Can you hear me okay I can hear you Perfect
(11:37) How are you good I'm doing really well Thanks for having me back I wanted to revisit the conversation we'd had Sure
(11:44) Um when I went out there in person I thought we had kind of a bit of a spirited back and forth I know that we
(11:50) agree on a lot of descriptors but um some of the prescripttors I thought we could we could get into again Okay Um
(11:57) after I was thinking about some of your points especially So Sure moving back I
(12:02) wanted to start with this Um do you agree with me that promiscuity in women
(12:08) is generally bad sure You you don't think that that's a
(12:14) good thing i don't really want to go down that rabbit hole because good and bad doesn't
(12:21) matter I'm in the business of predicting Okay Okay Well so if I had to predict
(12:26) where it's going to go women are going to keep getting promiscuous Yeah Yeah I agree with that So your predictive model
(12:31) I agree I'm not going to get into like morals or ethics with you That's not what I mean by good or bad like moral or immoral Right Right But like is it bad
(12:39) for women generally to be promiscuous like does it lower their value structure
(12:46) um you could say that Yeah But I don't really always see promiscuous women have
(12:53) bad outcomes in real life unfortunately Yeah Well the thing is is like because
(12:59) if it is the case that you you think that men are going to check out of society they're going to well they're
(13:04) going to check out and become promiscuous because marriage is a raw deal right then you're actually assigning Well some men don't care
(13:10) enough to even like like some men are just going to check out They're not even going to try to get sex Yeah Yeah I
(13:16) agree I agree with that So but wouldn't you be assigning these promiscuous women value then wouldn't they actually be a
(13:22) valuable asset to society if it is the case that if men can't get married and can just play the field and have sex
(13:28) with tons of women wouldn't they actually be very valuable to men then why would they be valuable to men well
(13:34) because obviously men want to [ __ ] them right and if they're if they're losing Well men need sex right that isn't for a
(13:40) guy So then these women would be valuable right well I think if they were val valuable they'd marry them wouldn't
(13:46) they well so yeah Well that's a fundamental question though If you're not going to marry That's the whole point If you're not going to marry them
(13:53) and you're just going to have sex with them then the value is in the sex itself Yeah I mean men do want to have sex Yeah
(14:00) Yeah So then that would be what would make women valuable is that they were essentially that that they were hoes
(14:07) essentially would make them valuable I mean they bring more value than the wives that are married and they don't sleep with their husbands
(14:13) You think you think hoes bring more value than wives than ones that don't sleep with their husbands which is
(14:19) really common yeah Well I I went through and pulled a bunch of the stats right so
(14:26) um when it especially when it comes to sexless marriages that usually happens uh years into the marriage over a decade
(14:33) in fact before that starts after after the youngest kids goes to preschool Yeah Yeah That's often often the case And
(14:40) often those are only for limited amounts of time right though not always right but it's actually a more isolated case
(14:46) When I look at the this is from Petrael uh I'm sorry Petrelli Preveter LLC they
(14:53) pulled up a they made a study on this We're talking about Christian marriage because you're asking what's the incentive for men to get married Well
(15:00) from a secular standpoint I think I agree with you that secularist men probably shouldn't It looks like it
(15:05) doesn't we're in a secular society Andrew Not yet We're We're getting there
(15:11) but we're not there yet You don't think it's pretty secular now not yet Like what p Like what percent of people even
(15:18) attend church weekly well that's true But 70% of the population does consider
(15:23) themselves to be at least identify selfidentifies as Christian But like don't you need actions to match that
(15:30) yeah you do But interestingly enough it must be because it's only 20 25% of
(15:36) Christian marriages which end in divorce at all I mean that's again what you guys say
(15:42) right i mean that's what the stats show Okay Yeah 20 20 to 25% But Gen Z you
(15:48) don't know what Gen Z is going to be And that's the whole point I mean wouldn't they follow the same trends roughly
(15:56) i would guess it would be worse Why because Gen Z women are the first
(16:03) women that are on social media Plus divorce keeps going up over time
(16:11) Well uh divorce is lower now than it has been ever right because people aren't getting married Because because you're
(16:17) kind of trying to divert the divorce isn't going up Because the thing is you're trying to divert from the question If you want marriage to
(16:23) increase you have to give a good answer to the question because it's the only way that you can have it's the only way
(16:28) you can have children without single motherhood What do children get out of marriage
(16:34) uh well if the if mommy and daddy aren't married right then the children have
(16:39) very very bad outcomes Single mother homes have terrible outcomes and single father homes aren't tenable generally
(16:45) speaking because they're the working parent right so the only way for men to have families is through marriage So
(16:51) what do women get out of marriage uh they generally get resources They generally get resources and they get
(16:58) access to status social status uh security things like this And what do
(17:03) men get out of marriage they get children out of marriage Okay And what do they get out of marriage
(17:10) that they couldn't get from just a living girlfriend mothers
(17:15) So here's Well an intact family in other words So here's the thing If the woman if the woman lives with him Yeah Well
(17:23) the the thing is is when we look at and the other Hang on hang on Well let me respond to it If we look at the social
(17:29) data for what you're talking about this happens all the time That's called a single mom right that you live with the
(17:36) chick you impregnate the chick you're not married to the chick Those end up Crowder's in Crowder's in the same
(17:41) position So are a lot of like He doesn't have children with some No he doesn't He doesn't have children with a with some
(17:48) live-in girlfriend Right Right But he's not with the mother of his kids now He had a really public divorce Yeah But
(17:54) there's a different like I know but my point is you can say data data data all you want but when we're like people are
(18:00) witnessing conservative people that pushed a lot of this stuff getting divorced like men are going to naturally
(18:07) do a costbenefit analysis and realize there's no difference So here's the costbenefit here's a costbenefit
(18:14) analysis and so my other question too would be who do
(18:19) the kids belong to do they belong to him or do they belong to her yeah So I believe in uh patrineal society I think
(18:26) that children belong to their fathers and always have thought so and that would be a form of reform inside of the
(18:32) court By the way traditionally this was always the way it happened But in society today where women get custody
(18:37) 90% of the time who do the kids belong to they do That's not the case anymore
(18:42) They don't get it 90% of the time They belong to her Do they belong to her or do they belong to him well they belong
(18:48) to the court system They're the ones who made the allocation And where are the majority of the time who gets custody
(18:54) yeah that's generally speaking women I agree Okay So what do men get out of marriage if the time the kids belong to
(19:02) her and not him okay But here's the thing You got to let me actually answer Okay So I'll try to answer this question
(19:08) but it's comprehensive So the step one you have to reform the system the court
(19:13) system Men have to move towards the reformation of the court system Um that is that challenging yes but prenuptual
(19:20) agreements as cited I went and looked at the data again They are mostly enforced
(19:26) That is the case right but when they're contested when they're when they're let me finish pro when they're contested you
(19:33) know because when they're contested you're not allowed to I'm not allowed to make a point You're still you're still
(19:39) going to get dragged to court That's the problem So a lot of guys if the prenup
(19:44) you're not going to get dragged to court that this is the this is the issue right like this is a performative contradiction Here's how Okay Because
(19:51) you say that women are reliance upon these men for resources That's what women are getting out of it So why is it
(19:56) if you had a prenup they're not going to get resources Why would they drag them to court why because they're spiteful Why did Why
(20:03) did Crowder's wife would be Why did Crow Crowder's wife got a bunch of money why did I know but why did Crowder's wife
(20:10) leak footage to the press she didn't have to do that She'd probably because she thought it would help her case for resources right but the the problem is
(20:19) in the court of public opinion Women are spiteful It's not always about money Ashley St Clair was offered a ton of
(20:25) money just to shut up right she didn't shut up Yeah But here's the thing right
(20:30) ashley Stlair is going to get the money either way right she has the kid in the arrangement That was not a marriage
(20:36) Inside of a marriage if Crowder had signed a prenup I bet you things would have been completely different across
(20:42) the board Same thing with most men who are wealthy who sign prenuptual agreements They end up women want the
(20:48) resources That's the whole gain right i want the resources resources If they can't get the resources it's an incentive for the behavior Not only that
(20:56) but here's the other thing Um if if you promote against marriage against the idea of marriage and I'm not saying that
(21:03) you like this idea that I'm Michael Nolles or something I'm telling men just take the plunge and take the risks No
(21:09) we're both doing risk mitigation Pearl's doing risk mitigation I'm doing risk mitigation What I'm saying with with
(21:15) Pearl saying with risk mitigation is for no man is it ever worth it So just play the field that I did I don't tell men
(21:21) what to do Okay Okay I don't I don't think it's my I think I think it ultimately reduces to that though So the
(21:28) thing is is that my position is just this risk for risk mitigation If you want to have children in a family the
(21:35) best outcome for the kids are it's going to be marriage Like no matter what it's going to be marriage Um but you have to
(21:41) do risk mitigation That's what's in it for the kids and for the man but not for the man Because when you get married
(21:47) you're just adding on another layer of what of now she can go for alimony
(21:54) Because a lot of times it's not about the money Andrew I mean yeah like sometimes it is the money but it's like
(21:59) men want to stop dealing with crazy women Like the the amount of money men will pay to get a wife to stop nagging
(22:06) him And now she can contest She can if she chooses contest the prenup and drag
(22:11) him to court He could agree with the terms that she like asks for or whatever just to get it over with But it's like
(22:18) the spitefulness of women It's not necessarily always the money And so
(22:24) again you're going back to what's best for the kids right but you don't answer the question what's best for him what
(22:31) having a family is what's best for him right by every single conceivable metric having a family is what's best for men
(22:36) It lowers the rates of STDs It earns the the earning income goes up Their general welfare and happiness in a happy
(22:43) marriage goes way up We can tell because we can look at the suicidality of men who have gone through uh terrific
(22:49) divorces or who stay single right and their depression rates are skyhigh All
(22:54) of these things are high Why do you think they make more money in marriage well that would be the incentive for
(23:00) their kids Well right To keep up with kids are cheap It's women's spending habits that are expensive
(23:07) right the Botox the clothes I mean we had your We had your wife We had your We
(23:12) had your um your wife on and she was going through the cost of kids It's not as expensive um seemingly as what people
(23:19) say according to Yeah So I just just real quick 90 90% is up to 90% the vast
(23:25) overwhelming majority of prenuptual agreements are not successfully contested in court It seems like a
(23:31) massive incentive for women if they want to hold their resources even from a secular side to do this But if you
(23:37) combine this with the Christian side the Christian ethics side of very religious women the divorce rate goes down to damn
(23:43) near nil Okay Well do are most women religious in this society no Okay But
(23:50) neither are most men Okay Right But so now you're going into like selling your religion right well if you want to have
(23:57) a family if you want to have the most successful family Yeah Right But I mean Orthodox is 1% of the population I'm not
(24:03) a religious show It's not just for Orthodox I'm What I'm What I'm talking about is and again you're not really
(24:10) answering the question You're saying you might get your kids No what I'm saying is that by every
(24:16) single conceivable metric which is available for men men's the what is
(24:21) considered the loneliness epidemic or the number one reported mental health issue for men is that they're lonely
(24:28) They feel lonely If the if that is the case and loneliness goes away when they
(24:33) get married then it seems like what would be really good for men would be to get married in a good stable
(24:39) relationship Your counter is but there's not that many marriageable women Correct There's never always but you agree with
(24:46) that right so most men aren't getting a marriageable woman Most men never got one right so most men it's not marriage
(24:54) isn't for them Yeah But you can't create the conditionals Most men like if like
(24:59) out of two men or 10 men over six aren't going to get a good deal right which
(25:07) correl no I'm what I'm telling them specifically is very simple That the
(25:14) historic fact of the matter is is that most men never got to reproduce at all Your chances of reproduction now are way
(25:21) higher than ever And the reason the sex drive is so high for men is because it's a biological imperative for reproduction
(25:27) Otherwise you wouldn't get a boner and want to go have sex right especially not with uh uh good-looking younger-looking
(25:33) women That's the whole point of it Mhm If you if you want uh stability in society which is good for men you want
(25:40) stability uh against degeneracy which is also very good for men then you want stable marriages for men What does
(25:47) society give men in return for producing a stable society what do they give men in return
(25:55) well society never gave men anything for the production of stable societies Fine But I'm asking today what do they give
(26:02) them in return yeah I mean for for what men get what men get in exchange for
(26:08) having a stable society is they get a stable society That's the exchange That's always been the exchange Like
(26:14) historically men have always been fodder They've always been war fodder They've always been basically treated poorly But
(26:20) the idea here that we have to make perfect conditionals for marriage absent
(26:25) any risk or mitigating risk is silly That's impossible no matter what If men keep getting married what is the
(26:31) incentive for the laws to change whereas they're not Well well hang on They can
(26:37) still get married absent the state and that would still create conditionals for the laws to change If men keep having
(26:42) children what is the incentive for society to give them fairer laws
(26:48) well what do you mean if they had if they have children and there's there's prenuptual agreements in place women now
(26:54) have incentive to not destroy their own financial security for the future But again so you're saying well she won't
(27:00) completely ruin your life right you're not saying a reward Yeah but like you get enthusiastic sex with a
(27:07) hot a hot wife but there's a lot of You missed the point though that there's a lot of marriages that work What about
(27:13) the fact that there's so many marriages that work statistically that's just not true Okay let's look at the statistics
(27:19) since you want to bring them up Go ahead Um you're looking at an estimate of 40% 40% of the marriages are failing Okay
(27:27) The vast majority of them are still still not And as less people get married those marriages are actually working out
(27:32) What is the obesity rate in America oh it's overwhelming for men and women Okay Okay Are most men men ecstatic to take
(27:39) on this enormous risk and responsibility for a fat wife no Okay So again you have
(27:45) to answer the question what's in it for men i'm answering the question So what's in it for men is the only thing that's
(27:50) ever been in it for men Family Yeah And I I don't think it's going to be a good enough answer If you're right then men
(27:58) are going to sign up to get married You don't have to convince me I Yeah but what about what about like the
(28:04) qualifiers of men have to live in this world right we have to live in this
(28:10) world We live in a world full of degeneracy and basically horrifying
(28:15) things because of the instability of society And you almost disempower them in a way because you're saying they
(28:21) don't have the power to change the nature of law I just want them to make an informed decision Yeah But I mean the
(28:27) the informed decision towards what their happiness whatever they want to do It's not my place to tell men Do you think
(28:33) they want to be happy it's not my place to tell men how to live Well do you think they want to be happy though well
(28:39) I think that happiness is a feeling that comes and goes So I don't really So you don't want them to be happy They just
(28:45) want to do what they want No I didn't say that I said it's a feeling that comes and goes Yeah I think ultimately
(28:53) you would want men happy right um I want them to do what they want to
(28:59) do Okay Well do you think that most men want to be happy i'm not a preacher channel right i'm not I'm not saying
(29:05) that you're a preacher I'm not preaching right now I'm just talking about the facts The facts of the matter are Don't
(29:11) you think men want to be happy well if you if marriage makes them happy then I'm sure they'll sign up I'm sure the
(29:17) marriage rates will go up Yeah That's not that's not an answer to the question I asked The qu the question I asked
(29:22) specifically is do you think men want to be happy
(29:28) Yeah Okay So if you think that men want to be happy and if we look at all of the data that we can possibly find on male
(29:34) promiscuity and happiness it doesn't look very good for them So even if it were the case that you advocate against
(29:40) marriage which is fair especially secular marriage advocate against marriage I see it I see it
(29:47) I see it disappearing from the middle class completely I see it just becoming
(29:53) um something that the rich do And I see the birth rates continuing
(29:59) to decline And I see marriage going away because people like you can't give men
(30:04) good answers on why they get married should should wait Should should wait
(30:10) Should accumulate that risk You're saying you're saying you're saying risk 40% of your income for 18
(30:18) years If you have two plus children the woman can take you to court and take 40%
(30:23) of your income It's not that every woman will It's that every woman can As soon as you enter into a marriage contract
(30:29) she is the Now answer my question What did men ever get out of marriage what did men ever get out of marriage they
(30:34) don't really care about what they got in their answer my question What did they ever get out of I don't care because I'm
(30:39) talking about I don't care if you don't care Answer the question What did men ever get out of marriage i don't care if
(30:46) we have to operate for marriage We have to operate for marriage What does what does a guy What does a guy care about
(30:52) what happened aundred years ago he cares about the decisions he has to make today Yeah I know But he has to use like a
(30:59) question avoiding machine So you want me You want me to do what you do which is prescribe I don't prescribe I'm not even
(31:04) asking for prescriptions I'm asking right now for a description What did men ever get out of marriage what yeah Well
(31:10) I can think it's a stupid question So like but I don't think I don't think it I don't think it matters What did they
(31:16) ever get out of it ever i don't know Tell me You don't know Go ahead Tell me Tell me They got the same thing I'm
(31:22) prescribing which is a family That's the What What else would the incentive ever need and again and if if that's so great
(31:29) then men will sign up If that's okay if if a product's if a
(31:36) product's good there's a big demand right there is a big demand Men want to get married Sure Then yeah but they
(31:42) wanted to they would right well we talk past each other is like if you you can if you describe all the issues that's fair right but the description of the
(31:50) issue is supposed to be for the purpose of what men do best which is solving the issue I don't mind you giving all the descriptors I think that's great But the
(31:57) the idea of like Andrew what do men get right now that's not a good enough reason What did men ever get out of the same reason It must be the best reason
(32:04) then run for office Run I mean I would much rather fund NOS's so that I could
(32:10) get people in key positions to change law But I the same same principle But what I'm saying to you is like from a
(32:16) descriptive standpoint I have been doing it Okay Okay That I'm sure there'll be great change in the next 10 years Well we're
(32:22) going to try and I'll be completely wrong Yeah But I mean it the trends the trends can continue to nose dive Let's
(32:29) assume for a second that like it all nose dives What does the future look like then well I don't think there'll be
(32:36) change until my prediction is we'll only see change when society crumbles enough
(32:41) for women to face the consequences of their decisions And what happens then
(32:47) then there might be change That's what I would say I would I would predict that things go down until things are fall
(32:55) falling apart enough and then maybe there'll be a policy change Maybe
(33:00) probably not Probably not Meaning we can fix the problems right uh not anytime soon No No But when we reach this like
(33:07) plateau sure so then wouldn't it logically follow then that we should accelerate
(33:13) the decline as quickly as possible to reach that plateau to fix these things sure If that's Sure So then so then
(33:20) that's an accelerationist mindset right i I'm not saying one way or the other
(33:25) I'm saying I don't see them changing anytime soon That's it I don't Yeah I
(33:31) don't think I don't think in my lifetime they'll be major But ultimately do you want to see them change it would be nice
(33:38) Yeah So So then if that if that's the case let's I'll just assume the position for a moment your position just
(33:43) descriptors Here's where we're going Mhm It would still be really wise to have
(33:48) men's rights advocacy groups and things like this in place for this inevitable decline so that those types of policies
(33:55) can then be pushed so that we're like ready for them Right Sure But the first one was in 1910 So I don't if if we're where we are
(34:04) today and the first one was over a hundred years ago The first what policy no the first men's right to advoc I
(34:10) think it was around 1910 I don't know the exact Yeah But they were advocating for completely different things right um
(34:17) I mean I saw ones about divorce law early in the 1900s off the top of my head I I don't know But yeah Yeah I mean
(34:25) divorce it used to be we had coverture laws So I mean coverture laws basically in that case you had to have show cause
(34:32) in order to get divorce and coverture laws things like that It was most of the early 1900s I believe So the thing is
(34:38) interesting though is like my my point is I just don't see it being
(34:43) effective because the last hundred years it's gotten worse not better So why would I think Okay go ahead Yeah Yeah
(34:50) But I mean ever so the thing is is like things have gotten better Abortion laws have been rolled back
(34:57) right gone up True Only in some states though I went and checked the stats on that as well Sex work has gone up too
(35:04) But you know what else is going down is uh female promiscuity and male promiscuity over time And what's
(35:09) interesting STD but STD rates are up So how do you because sex work is up Okay
(35:15) Well if that's what you if that's not what the guys dating are saying but okay
(35:20) Yeah Because they're dating women who have only I mean you're talking about like one in 10 or one in 20 now can have
(35:26) an only fans The sex work epidemic has exploded STDs It I mean we can look at
(35:31) this objectively When the last time you dated like when's the last time you actually dated oh it's been [ __ ] I
(35:37) don't know like what 17 years or so So how do you how do you think you know better than the guys dating like what's
(35:43) out there i mean when's the last time you dated like um a year ago year Okay So so from your So from your sample size
(35:50) you think that in 17 years the marketplace for dating has changed so much that I'm not allowed to have any
(35:56) input in it oh no Come I just don't think you really know what's on the ground um if you haven't done it in 17
(36:01) years because it's ch the advent of social media has changed the dating marketplace a lot like a lot
(36:10) Yeah Why do you think Wait a second back up I don't understand why you think that you couldn't have input and research the
(36:16) stat I'm using the same stats you're using Like it's not and I have the same conversations with thousands of people
(36:22) you have men and women both um the the same exact the same amount of anecdotal
(36:28) evidence and stat statistics right sorry What I what I could say maybe a better way to say it is I think it's like an
(36:33) oversimplification of the problem when you're saying "Oh it's just like bad women that these guys are dating." Like
(36:41) I don't really think it's that that's not what I said at all Or it's just sex worker It's just sex worker women that
(36:48) these guys are dating right no that's that would account for one thing STDs The STD rates going down Yeah Okay Yeah
(36:54) So what I what I Isaiah gave you was the answer that you're always looking for
(37:00) that men get out of marriage same thing they always got out of it a family And why is it that men are always
(37:06) gravitating towards family well it seems to be biologically hardwired in them because they've always done that Sure it
(37:11) is So if that's the case their happiness levels intrinsically tied to that It
(37:16) seems that if you wanted to advocate for men then you would be advocating the most for the idea of keeping marriage uh
(37:24) sacraanaked and also making sure that these things got reformed as quick as possible Mhm Okay If someone took your
(37:32) prescription what is your can you give me like step by step your prescription for how men if to get married stay
(37:38) married what's your prescription how Well first of all I wouldn't say you you keep on framing this as oh so I'm saying
(37:44) take a plunge when I'm not saying take Totally fine Tell me your what's beginning to end So where should they
(37:49) where should they source i would look at I would look at these stats and No not the stats Where should they source the women from like what state should they
(37:56) go to what church i'm guessing you're going to say Orthodox Okay So I'll answer your question right
(38:04) you're not going to find huge variances state by state Okay You're just not going to Okay But you can you can
(38:10) definitely upgrade the chances of you finding a woman who's not going to have these behaviors which you and I would
(38:16) both consider nonoptimal So it wouldn't just be the Orthodox church Roman Catholic Church and even Protestants As
(38:23) long as as long as the worship is more than one time per week right their
(38:28) marriage rates significantly go down If you get married as a virgin you almost never get a divorce because your sample
(38:34) size is super low Um so are you saying they should they should find a virgin or
(38:39) do you expect do you think that's realistic nowadays to find a virgin woman yeah Yeah No no
(38:45) no I'm giving you a step-by-step prescription of all the things you can do to mitigate risk No but I'm I'm not I'm not saying mitigate risk I'm saying
(38:51) do they download a dating app are they going to go on Instagram how are they going to do it okay So if you search
(38:59) Yeah Yeah So I'll I'll walk through it right but I'm What we're talking about is risk mitigation So let's start with
(39:05) risk mitigation Your chance I want the dating process from beginning to end Oh
(39:10) okay We'll give Go ahead What do you want me to give a dating process from beginning to end for every individual
(39:16) man on planet Earth uh okay If a guy wants to go in your prescription no the dating process is going to be varied How
(39:23) is he going to source women on region it's going to be varied on man It's going to be varied on what options are
(39:28) available But what you can look at is all the signs of the universals which mitigate risk What you're asking is for
(39:33) an absurdity It's like me asking "Tell me step by step Well tell me step by step How do I become a successful
(39:40) podcaster?" Every man every woman on earth how do you become a successful i
(39:45) could do that pretty easily I could do it No but I asked you first And you don't have an answer because you don't
(39:50) have an impossible question No it's actually pragmatic because if you have a real pragmatic if you have a a real plan
(39:57) for men you have to have a step by step like what's step one Yeah So step one
(40:04) would be looking at the mitigation for risk That would be step one You have to get a girl on a date first before you
(40:09) even get there No you don't have to get a girl on a date to mitigate risk bro Okay Well I guess there's no risk if you
(40:15) never get on the date Yeah that's right So the thing is if you're talking about walk away so walk away We're talking about sourcing the women from you're
(40:22) asking for Stop cutting me off I need you If you're asking a question you got
(40:27) to let me answer the question I'm not answering the question What's the question but then you have to not talk while I answer it Okay I'll try I'm a
(40:34) woman so it's kind of tough Okay go ahead Step byep process How does he get a girl on a date where should get a girl
(40:41) on a date you would go online You'd have conversations with women everywhere that you went The various things that we've
(40:47) always done to get women on dates Okay So you go on the dating apps and get women on dates No I didn't say that What
(40:52) did I say back what I said You said you said go online I assumed you dating apps and talk to women and talk to women
(41:00) Totally fine Yes Are you ever going to get a woman Are you ever going to get a woman on a date pearl if you don't talk to any of them i Okay so you talk to
(41:07) women in Are you ever going to get a woman on a date if you don't talk to them okay So I want to keep going through the process No I want to keep
(41:14) going through the process So you meet them on a dating app Okay Or you meet them on I didn't say meet them on a
(41:19) dating app Okay Then can you tell me where yeah I would All you have to do to
(41:25) begin the initial process of dating women is use whatever connections resources you have to start connecting
(41:32) with various women You can use dating apps Sure that seems to be one of the most common ways that you do it But you
(41:37) can also use friends of friends You can use your family members You can use all sorts of different ways to connect with
(41:44) women the same way that men and women have been connecting forever Sure Except now you have also the online component
(41:49) Sure Totally fine So then what's next do you take her on a date is that you can you can take her on a date but usually
(41:55) the second step would be to be in the talking phase and inside the talking phase you're able to actually identify
(42:01) many of these risk mitigating factors which become immediately apparent in 90%
(42:06) of the conversations they become they become uh very apparent the red flags or the risk mitigation I wouldn't take a
(42:12) woman on a date I would be in the talking phase with multiple women for an elongated period of time before I ever
(42:18) took one out on a date Okay Fine So how long should they talk before they get to the date well it's going to vary from
(42:25) person to person Okay But what would you suggest i would suggest that you talk to them until you feel like you've gathered
(42:31) enough information and intel on the mitigation of these red flags and then I would take them Sure you could take them on a day then Okay And what information
(42:38) are you trying to get from them well that's great Glad that you asked that question For risk mitigation I'd be
(42:45) looking for things like were you raised by a single mom right What are your goals what are the structure in life
(42:50) that you're after whether or not it is the case you have a present father in your life How many tattoos do you have
(42:55) that would be another good one Your promiscuity level I do a little intel maybe around their Facebook things like this How many male friends they have
(43:02) there's tons and tons Okay The same things you know that women do Yeah Totally fine So now you get her on the
(43:07) date Are you trying to sleep with her are you are you waiting till you're you're suggesting they wait till
(43:12) marriage is that what you're I Well yeah Only if they want the best outcomes Yeah And they don't want to create single moms that they have to take care of
(43:19) their children Yeah it seems like a good idea If she's if she's not a virgin are you telling them they should still wait till marriage uh yeah I still would Yeah
(43:27) If you're interested in a woman who's not a virgin right my assumption is the man's not going to be a virgin either
(43:33) 95% right Yeah And most of the men aren't going to be virgins who are taking those women out either Okay
(43:38) That's the case Yes Factually that is the dating market So you want men to pay a higher price for what other men got
(43:44) for free Oh so okay Well let's just grant this Let's say they don't right
(43:50) you want men to sleep with a woman on the first date Can you answer my question i'll answer yours Okay So the
(43:55) answer's in the answer I I'll explain it No So the thing is you don't like the answer You don't have to sleep with this
(44:03) woman to get to know her If you think that she's worth the risk and if you think that she's worth it to you know
(44:09) stick around to sleep with later or to you know date long term sure The problem that you have here is that we operate No
(44:17) no no My turn If you we operate off of your logic right should they if a woman
(44:23) has ever slept with a man ever should no man ever wait to sleep with that woman i
(44:29) think should be That's a tough cell What's that you can sell that It's a tough cell
(44:36) So then you think that the woman if you've ever had sex as a woman you should just give it up
(44:42) Okay So you want guys to like answer the question Answer the question I will answer that question No you're not
(44:48) answering the question I will answer that question If a woman's ever had sex every man should date should she [ __ ]
(44:54) I will No I don't think so Okay So then you're saying she should make him wait I
(44:59) don't I I think there's certain men you can treat special though And I think most men want to be treated special and
(45:06) not like other men So So is every man you've ever gone on a date with have you slept with him immediately
(45:12) um no How about How about you how about you no I don't sleep with any men No
(45:18) What was your dating experience like did you wait i mean if you want to go person of course I I like to get to know people
(45:24) things like this Of course But the thing is is like that's my point My point is I don't want to go personal but if you're
(45:30) you know what I mean you know I'm not trying to be personal I'm trying to demonstrate a point Of course you don't sleep with every man immediately That
(45:35) would be absurd That's not a personal attack But but women do sleep with men faster that they like
(45:42) Generally speaking I think the same thing with men They generally will try sleep if they like How would a guy know
(45:48) the difference between a girl that's using him for resources um or like just trying to use him for
(45:56) what for the lifelong provisioning or that actually likes him Well every woman is going to be utilizing men to some
(46:03) degree for resources and historically always has The idea though that you can't mitigate these risks by taking a
(46:09) look at the entirety of their social media doing a little social stocking which is you're just looking around at
(46:15) their connections and things like this in order to see what the general trend is you can you can basically determine
(46:21) this fairly quickly In fact men have become so savvy to this in the dating market they're beginning the high rates
(46:26) of rejection now where they're like "Nope There's no women there's no women that at all could mitigate any of this."
(46:35) I mean the biggest hoes that I knew in school had pretty much no digital footprint no social media
(46:41) None Well I mean because they because they No because they it's like a strategy
(46:47) actually cuz they want to get like um they want to get around and Well it's really difficult now Well then even if
(46:53) that was a small I would just put that as another red flag Oh you have no social media presence Maybe that's
(46:59) another red flag Wouldn't Wouldn't you say that women are developing new strategies every like year to get around
(47:05) some of Totally But don't you think that some of the men that you're suggesting this to are going to get got just
(47:11) balance the probabilities Yeah But so no matter what conditionals we make in society some men are going to get got
(47:16) There's nothing you can do about that ever Doesn't matter if you had the perfect utopia some men are going to get got Okay So what percent going through
(47:23) all these strategies what percent of men do you think will get got i think that you can lower% I think you can lower the
(47:30) risk mitigation down to somewhere around 15 to 20% which is what we see in these types of elongated Christian marriages
(47:36) So you think about 20% of men will get got I think that all 20% of men have always gotten got and damn thing But why
(47:44) would a man take that deal uh because they want to have a family like they've always wanted to Right But
(47:50) and do you think that if people stay married that's automatically a successful marriage if they just don't
(47:57) divorce no That wouldn't always meet the criteria for a successful marriage So
(48:03) but but hang on By the same logic you would have to agree then that not every time women want to get divorced it's
(48:09) unjustified True I agree So if that if that's the case then you have an equal wash there So the idea here is what do
(48:16) we want for a stabilized society which makes sense But to have maximum happiness it seems
(48:23) to be marriage right but you're you're switching it back to what's in it for society And I I keep trying to stick to
(48:28) what's in it for the individ
(48:36) um a woman could potentially really ruin his life for 18 years Like I mean I'
(48:41) I've talked to like um a good percent What what failure rate's acceptable 1%
(48:47) Uh I think one is too many when you have a quarter of when you have a quarter of when you have a quarter of men raising
(48:52) kids that aren't theirs I think I think one time that happens is too many That's
(48:58) utopian That's literally utopian thinking So if there's ever a case that a man can get got then you would just
(49:04) recommend It's so silly That's utopianism That's impossible It's like saying no man should ever drive cars
(49:10) because they might get in a wreck It's like it's gonna happen I wouldn't say that's the same because I would say a
(49:16) car wreck um it is not likely that you're going to be enslaved to that car
(49:22) for 18 years Um and I think to the damage it does to I think maybe I just have a different point of view because
(49:27) I've I've seen men on the brink of suicide Andrew and I've seen men like like I one of the wor I've told you this
(49:34) story before One of the worst mar divorce stories I ever saw was a guy that took pretty much your advice Okay
(49:42) Which was what what's my advice um what what you say he waited till marriage He met a girl in a Latin Catholic mass
(49:49) church Y um he had the temperament Um he thought she was the right person
(49:54) Um and she it was actually really difficult She took his kid She was
(50:00) actually Eastern European So she was um Eastern Europe So she was actually raised to be a wife and she came to the
(50:05) US He met her in California Um and she stole the kid and took him back She won
(50:11) custody She took him back Um and he spent $300,000 trying to get her back He went into a war zone trying to get his
(50:17) kid Yeah Um he now the kid is like six He hasn't seen him in years The kid
(50:23) doesn't recognize him And he speaks Russian How is Is he happy you'll Yeah
(50:29) but it's easy I think it's easy maybe for you to like wave it away and just say "Well I'm not waving it away." Like
(50:35) that's horrible That's absolutely horrible Men it doesn't matter like don't even think about that risk But
(50:40) what I've seen don't think about that risk right but but you're saying but do it anyway And I'm I'm saying I can't
(50:47) tell you what to do because that is an astronomical risk that I understand is
(50:52) if you as a man don't want to take that I like I completely understand Another issue So here's the alternative Another
(50:59) Can you let me finish so another issue too is like the waiting till marriage I mean you go on monologues too a lot too
(51:06) Not long because you cut into every 5 seconds Other the other thing um is one out of three women have
(51:12) STDs So you can Does the sex work um no not necessarily Yeah we can look at the
(51:19) height of the promiscuity The sexual revolution wasn't even close Wasn't even close Yeah but a lot of normal women
(51:25) have STDs too They do Yeah they always have It's Yeah true Go to men They
(51:31) usually get it from promiscuous sex as well right but that's back to the what about the men though we're talking about
(51:37) It's not what about the men I'm just giving an accounting for this for how this works STD So STDs would be a good
(51:42) idea for not having promiscu promiscuous sex But if the idea is like because some
(51:49) men are going to have catastrophic results and we can never mitigate that I don't care what society you're in ever
(51:54) You're not going to be able to mitigate that some men are going to have catastrophic results that instead they should use women basically Hang on And
(52:01) women them for purely sexual hedonistic needs If that's the case you then the very ideology of like look at all these
(52:08) STDs that explodes under that same ideology that that's like silly It's counterproductive Well under your
(52:14) strategy they could marry a woman with herpes Like yeah under your strategy they're going to get herpes anyway I
(52:20) mean because if you wear a condom it's less than 1% of men that then why are they exploding um they're getting
(52:27) they're exploding because men are men and women aren't wearing condoms Um but if you wear a condom it's not the rate
(52:33) the likelihood of you getting something especially as a guy is pretty low So men are just stupid Don't know how to wear
(52:38) condoms or uh I mean some men they really Yeah they really should Yeah No I
(52:45) don't think so I think that to be honest Yeah I mean a lot of guys they don't What what's happened is promiscuity
(52:50) especially in the sex in the sex industry where STDs are 10 times higher has now been gravitating towards women's
(52:56) bedrooms on only fans and things like this They have a continuous chain of men who come in they're promiscuous with and
(53:03) this has exploded the STD rate And by the way I can prove this because in every western nation where sex works can
(53:08) be done from the home You see these explosive rates generally in the areas where there's what the most amount of
(53:14) sex workers It gravitates out You think it's all sex work It's not the women in college No there's always been STDs of
(53:21) course that have been in the general public I'm not talking about the accounting for the explosion in them right but you don't think it's common on
(53:28) say college campuses for STDs to go around We're course but that's always been the case on college campuses Right
(53:34) Right But saying that's always I'm trying to operate in today not the past Right Yeah But I'm trying to give you a
(53:40) prism so that because you're acting like this stuff is new or that the mitigate or that risk mitigation is somehow new
(53:47) This is always been the case that men had to mitigate mitigate risk when it came to marriage You're only talking
(53:53) about the selection of well you could get really [ __ ] by the courts which is true and that the courts are biased
(53:59) towards women which is true I'm giving prescripttors for how we begin the process of changing those things Whereas
(54:05) what you do is you act as though these are brand new societal issues when they're actually not brand new societal
(54:11) issues I operate in today so I try to focus on what's going on now Yeah But
(54:17) can't you look to the past for prescriptions right Why not if the past
(54:22) not if it doesn't matter It matters Okay Well or we can't give prescriptors We can't we can't give prescriptions of the
(54:28) future unless we look at societies which worked right but societies that don't exist today that are different than
(54:34) today I have to operate in I have to operate I'm not a lawmaker So I have to
(54:39) operate in the society we have today Yeah You're not a lawmaker You're an influencer So you to influence people
(54:45) into law making or influence people towards laws Are you to influence them towards better behaviors or things like
(54:50) that influencers that think they have that kind of sway and power are just as
(54:55) delusional as the women that think that they're going to get a man that makes like $5 million a year That's my belief
(55:02) Yeah So you may think you may think different That's just what I think Go ahead Yeah Yeah So well I mean the
(55:08) Democratic party and the Republican party seem to disagree as they're buying up influencers left and right all over
(55:13) the country and it seems to be swaying a lot of localized elections So I think influencers must have some kind of I
(55:18) don't know influence right otherwise why is it that the political arms of the various parties are doing everything
(55:24) they can to get them under their wig so ultimately I think I think when we're talking about your kind of descriptive
(55:31) world again I don't even disagree with a lot of these descriptions but if we
(55:36) apply Pearl Davis's descriptions which do sound more prescriptive why should
(55:42) men do X right well it's like okay well here's why And then you say but here's the risk for that Okay I agree there's
(55:48) the risk for that Well now what i don't know Is that it just like I don't know If a product is good then people are
(55:55) lining up to buy it And so what you're doing is you're saying "No no there's no
(56:00) risk Men men are lining up to buy this." But the stats just don't say that They
(56:06) don't So if you're if you're right then first of all I reject I reject If you're right then the marriage
(56:13) rate will go up and it traditionalism will return I hope you're right Yeah
(56:19) Yeah Yeah but don't don't you like don't you understand that the positive of your framing is completely rejected by me i'm
(56:27) not one of these guys who's making these crazy advocations for "Hey bro just take
(56:32) the plunge bro and hopefully things will work out bro." That's the um the the con
(56:37) guys who are saying "Ah this is all men's fault this and that." I'm talking about prescriptive mitigations to try to
(56:43) fix the issues in marriage the very thing men are screaming that they want more than anything And you just say
(56:50) "Well kind of just do what you want Here's the information Good luck." It's like "Okay you can do that." But then in
(56:56) what account can you ever criticize any of those guys in the con Inc party who
(57:02) give prescriptions how can you ever do that if you don't give a counter prescription well if they're prescriptions are leading men to their
(57:08) death and men are nine times more likely to commit suicide because they don't warn them I can criticize them What
(57:15) should they do instead i'm saying what should they do instead i I think they should make an informed decision because
(57:21) I just I think I think they should make an informed decision Why is a man immoral if he doesn't choose to get
(57:28) married it's deep So that's not immoral Okay So then why are you arguing with me yeah Well the argument here is is about
(57:35) men's happiness and what they get right not about whether or not it's moral if they get married or not I'm not saying
(57:40) it's immoral for men to not get married I could be okay Then what's the disagreement then then why the disagreement is on the prescription of
(57:46) why it is that I didn't give a prescription marriage that marriage well here's the disagreement I'm trying to explain it to you I'm not saying that
(57:52) it's immoral for men to not get married I am I am interested in the happiness and longevity of men and their overall
(58:00) wellness well-being and health in the society have to live in because I count on them to provide the security I count
(58:07) on them to provide all luxury I count on them to build all infrastructure And so if men aren't doing well none of us are
(58:15) doing well And so if we're going to uh associate these problems and con says
(58:20) "We'll just take the plunge because society continues to go and Pearl Davis says men can just do whatever the [ __ ]
(58:25) they want." Then it's like "Well then how do you criticize anything uh prescriptively how do we get anywhere
(58:31) prescriptively it makes no sense to me." Do you think men should do what you want i think that if
(58:37) prescriptively you move towards the type of society I advocate for I think yes the wellness of men would do way better
(58:42) So men should do what you want and not what they want No they should do prescriptively what's best for men Okay
(58:48) That's not that is true that I'm aligned with that but that's not doing what I want That's doing what's in their best
(58:54) interest Okay So men should listen to you and not not them not what they want
(59:00) for their life but what you want for their life Well what did I just say i just said that according to what they
(59:05) want for their life is happiness And if I want for my life happiness also and if we're we have a combined belief on the
(59:11) prescriptive things that would make us happy then that's what men including me should move towards So you're saying I read these stats I read these studies Um
(59:19) now do what I say because I read these studies Well and Pearl Davis is doing the same thing I read these stats and
(59:24) studies and everything's really bad for men So I mean if you want to if you know if you want to take the plunge of 20%
(59:30) you might get [ __ ] here And is it really worth it i'm not sure it's worth it I say you're you're a man It's your
(59:36) house You get to do what you want in your house That's out of order I'm not going to tell a man how what to do Well
(59:42) you're not telling them what to do But you can still you Isn't it true that you can offer up prescriptions in society
(59:49) which are good for society and good for men without telling men that they need to ought to do those prescriptions like
(59:54) hey prescriptively if we did X that might be really good for men That doesn't mean you're telling men what to do
(1:00:02) I can give my opinion if somebody asks but that's not my job I'm I'm here Did
(1:00:09) you lower the volume a little bit i don't know why I like can hear him less now No No Could you talk again uh
(1:00:16) testing testing testing Could you turn up my mic or like my headphones just like a little bit sorry
(1:00:23) Um you But then you would say you wouldn't say you should do it You would say you could
(1:00:29) But once you get into should and you're saying this is what you should say I would say any prescription
(1:00:36) which is going to be good for the overall health of men they should be moving towards that Yes Mhm Right And so
(1:00:43) if it was moving towards the overall health of men it would be an easy cell and men would do it and that well no not
(1:00:51) necessarily Men have gone along with lots of different things which were an easy cell because they were misled or
(1:00:57) they had bad information or collectively from the society Like here's an easy one Men go off to war They go off to literal
(1:01:04) war when they get drafted and that has been an easy cell but it definitely was not good for men What is this i think it
(1:01:12) might be here Sorry It's like buzzing now a little bit
(1:01:18) [Music] Okay Sorry So you're saying that men Well yeah but men in reward for
(1:01:23) protecting the country they got a family that actually stayed together But today that's not the norm No they didn't In
(1:01:29) the Vietnam War they didn't get that That's not the case They got that maybe post World War II They weren't getting it after Korea They weren't getting it
(1:01:35) after Vietnam They're drafted from both wars They weren't coming home to a family or coming home getting spit on Literally spit on And the thing is is
(1:01:43) like yes men can be tricked collectively into doing things that are really bad for men's health But the idea here that
(1:01:48) we should not be prescriptively did it because it was like an adventure That's probably why right like no they didn't
(1:01:54) just want to go on an adventure They did it for honor Yeah I mean and I would but I would say at one point society
(1:02:00) rewarded them for it Like now white men are the least likely to be in the military or it's like the lowest numbers
(1:02:07) in years like men are dropping out of the military because they don't see what's in it for them anymore And you
(1:02:13) know it's it's interest like um Yeah Well that's because there's no honor I think I think it's an interesting like
(1:02:19) sell on what you're trying to do Meet the women wait for not wait till marriage for a woman that's not pay a
(1:02:25) higher price than a previous guy and you'll be married for a life I I hope
(1:02:31) men if you want So this is again this is very classic if you guys want classic
(1:02:37) pearl framing but that's not actually what I said I'm not I'm offering an only
(1:02:42) an alternative to black pill and what am I saying the same thing you are men should be gravitating towards things
(1:02:48) which are good and healthy for men men are gravitating towards families because they want them if they didn't want them
(1:02:54) they wouldn't be having them who has more information on what makes a man happy you or him like an individual man
(1:03:02) watching This will be trivially true about any human being on earth Mhm So the each man has more information to
(1:03:08) make decisions in his life than you do right well no that's not always the case but I would say generally speaking
(1:03:15) people tend to think or know what makes them happier than you know some guy they don't know Sure Yeah So my I don't know
(1:03:23) if I want to Can I use you as an example but not say your name can I use you yeah I can Okay So my my producer is watching
(1:03:30) now right yeah He's he's listened to me talk now he's listening to you for the first time and he's hearing your
(1:03:36) strategies for marriage right who has more information on how he should make a
(1:03:41) decision moving forward in his relationships you or him yeah So obviously him but I'll also have more
(1:03:47) information probably on what's better for his relationships than you because I'm a man Totally Totally fine Totally
(1:03:53) fine But so who should make the decision should he listen to your advice or should he listen to himself what he
(1:04:00) thinks is best well so I would say that you also have to take into account that
(1:04:06) there's social responsibilities and honor that men have duties that they're supposed to gravitate towards There are
(1:04:12) actual duties men have to gravitate to the duty Okay Well what
(1:04:17) does he get what does he You don't think men don't have duties what does he I mean why why would you do something like
(1:04:23) men should just do nothing or what all right Well why why should they why should they work hard for a society that
(1:04:29) doesn't reward them i I have no problem I think that society should reward men right but it doesn't Yeah But it does It
(1:04:37) does actually reward men for hard work It doesn't always reward men for hard work with a family though That's not the
(1:04:43) reward societies have ever given men Menure their own stake forms Rewarded military members the last 50 years They
(1:04:50) have Yes Sure that I'm society has rewarded military members over the last 50 years Yes there's more during the
(1:04:58) Iraq war for instance there was a lot of honor that came back to the uniform and then post that now there's less more men
(1:05:04) have committed suicide um than all of the last that sorry more soldiers have committed suicide in the last 50 years
(1:05:10) than all of the world wars combined Yeah So society rewarded them No that's not a
(1:05:16) that's not a social societal issue of society trying to punish them Iraqi war
(1:05:22) veterans were not getting spit on like Vietnam war veterans Some of them maybe but it wasn't the same type of contextual information Here's why this
(1:05:29) happened This happened because of the tour So it used to be that soldiers were
(1:05:34) cycled out after one tour What happened during the Iraq war and Afghanistan war is they were going back for four five
(1:05:40) six tours They they were completely broken This was something the military has recognized multiple times Society
(1:05:47) itself though demanded that these wars be stopped Ultimately they demanded it That's why they put Trump in When you're
(1:05:54) talking about the social duties and responsibilities of men it is a fact of the matter They do have them The idea
(1:05:59) here though that this means that society rewards men with a family Is it going to end is it going to end okay I just
(1:06:06) You're doing that to me so I got to you know Yeah Yeah Yeah Fair enough So do you think that men have been respected
(1:06:12) the last 50 years and honored in society no that's not I didn't say that We're
(1:06:18) talking about the military a specific example Okay But in general have do men get respect no I think that men have
(1:06:23) been completely and totally disrespected as a bygone pieces of garbage The entire
(1:06:29) idea here is to try to change that right but you would you would you would understand the rationale for a guy that
(1:06:36) just says "Fuck it." Right because society doesn't reward him I under So here we can maybe come to some agreement
(1:06:43) Do I understand the rationale yes Oh yes I understand the rationale completely Does that mean that that's good for men
(1:06:50) though no No Okay And clearly it clearly it can't be because you say it can't be
(1:06:56) by your own logic But you know what's best for an individual No No You just you actually just gave the prescription
(1:07:02) It's pretty great You just said "Well so society is [ __ ] all over men and that's really bad for men right Andrew
(1:07:08) yeah I want to change that." And you go "But wait a second So you think you know what's best for men?" It's like well if
(1:07:13) we both agree that society [ __ ] on men is bad then it appears we both think we know what's best for men that society
(1:07:19) shouldn't [ __ ] on them They wouldn't like that Right Right But I don't predict it'll stop I wouldn't predict
(1:07:25) that it would change Well I can predict it'll never stop if we don't try to do anything about it I can make a 100%
(1:07:30) prediction It'll never stop if we don't try to do anything about it And run for office right go ahead Well you don't
(1:07:36) just need to run for office What you need to do is influence people who are in office That's the main thing people
(1:07:41) forget see NOS's and it's the lobbyists who ultimately are going to be able to make these influences for change All
(1:07:47) right In the next year what changes can I expect policywise probably not much effect Okay So my my
(1:07:54) producer my producer has to make a decision in the next year What's he going to do yeah Yeah So he has to make
(1:08:00) should he look at the history should he look at what might happen in the future yeah So if your producer is going to make a decision on marriage in the next
(1:08:06) year I'd give him the same advice any rational human being would ever have Great you want to get married make sure
(1:08:12) all of your risks are as mitigated as you can possibly make them so that you can move towards family like men have
(1:08:17) always historically done and are now getting much better at And then on top of that Mr Producer you can expect
(1:08:23) within the next few years that you're going to start seeing even more changes in the marriage court And here's my proof The number of kids living with
(1:08:31) their fathers has quadrupled from 68 to 2020 due to men's rights advocacy groups
(1:08:36) That seems to be good for men They can get access to their kids quadrupled Mural what do you think's going to
(1:08:42) affect my producer or someone similar to him more do you think you saying like these stats D or do you think what he's
(1:08:50) seen in real life is going to affect his decision making and what he thinks more
(1:08:56) people generally I think intuitively go off of experience first and then they mitigate but but they often mitigate
(1:09:02) experience when they start looking for answers for why things they've experienced have sucked So like bad
(1:09:08) thing happens and I hate it and so intuitively I don't want anything to do with this again But then you start
(1:09:14) looking for answers for why bad thing happened You listing stats and shaming
(1:09:19) men is not going to shaming is not is not I'm not is um that's a shaming
(1:09:25) tactic I'm telling you and is not going to make men want to get married and it's not going to make them not believe what
(1:09:31) they have seen How is it shaming men to tell men "I care a lot about men's
(1:09:37) health more than anything else and would really like to see influencers start moving towards prescriptions so that
(1:09:43) they live happier lives." How in the [ __ ] world could you ever say in a million years that that's a shaming
(1:09:48) tactic okay Sure You're not sure I mean how like how do you make that step now I
(1:09:54) would say on the other hand you shame men for sleeping around It's impossible guys You're way too
(1:10:00) [ __ ] stupid to understand the [ __ ] You shame men for not living the way that you want them to live No I'm not
(1:10:06) saying I'm not telling men they have to live how I want to live You call them degenerates You call them degenerates
(1:10:12) Yeah If they're gays they're degenerate aren't they Pearl okay Well no you call them degenerates if they sleep around
(1:10:18) Yeah If they're highly promiscuous I consider that to be degeneracy But I still even for those degenerate men want
(1:10:24) the best for for health and resources for those men But what about men that just want to live with a woman for 10
(1:10:30) years and have sex first or they terrible idea Horrible idea by every by every single metric Yeah Totally Totally
(1:10:38) degenerate and it's a terrible idea Sure But a better idea is to wait till
(1:10:43) marriage and give a woman the ultimate honor that you could ever give a woman
(1:10:48) Mhm Um and she comparison of those two situations and she doesn't even have to
(1:10:53) have sex with you to get it They don't have to have sex with you if you live with them either What's your point well like they don't have to have sex in that
(1:10:59) situation either And when you're looking at the fact that living with a woman long term without marrying her you end
(1:11:05) up anyway with these ideas of like common law marriage you can still get taken the ringer on that The other
(1:11:11) alternative there is that the the children generally going to have terrible outcomes between those two choices Absolutely I would prescribe
(1:11:18) that marriage is better than those Even bad marriage would be better than those Okay Yeah So um again that's a tough
(1:11:24) cell I hope I mean maybe the men in the audience will buy it right no I think I
(1:11:29) think that mine was the good sale So I think the shaming tactic comes from the idea of you saying but you're this is
(1:11:35) how I hear it What I hear is men are so [ __ ] stupid they can't mitigate their own risk So just check out guys you're
(1:11:40) too [ __ ] dumb And I think the opposite I think men are super [ __ ] smart and we can definitely do something
(1:11:45) inside of the societal social field to change the conditionals for men Who has more legal power men or women
(1:11:53) uh legal in which context at the mercy of the system or at the mercy of changing the system all right Who do
(1:12:00) politicians cater to men or women um they generally cater toward women and
(1:12:06) children's needs first Yes Who does the legal system cater to men or women
(1:12:12) generally speaking it's going to cater to the weaker sex and children Yes Who does the media cater to men or women
(1:12:18) yeah same I can just answer yes to all the institutions doing this Okay So how so if an individual man is going to
(1:12:24) outsmart this billion dollar system mhm So they're too dumb to do it Um I would
(1:12:31) say they don't have power I wouldn't say dumb but I don't But do men collectively have powers to overthrow entire systems
(1:12:38) via force okay But I mean when you're talking in the abstract that's like easy right no I'm talking in the I want to go
(1:12:44) I want to go specific So my producer he's listening right so he's he's going to make a decision in the next five
(1:12:49) years about what he wants to do with his life right And so he he's listening Now
(1:12:55) what power does he have if a woman throws an abuse claim at him what can he really do yeah So he can do the same
(1:13:02) thing that that men have always done during any sort of claim for abuse He
(1:13:08) can mitigate risk You can do this via uh security cameras You can do this via the Pence rule You can do this via all sorts
(1:13:14) of various rules that men have instituted to protect themselves from false allegations of abuse You're talking about inside of long-term
(1:13:21) relationships That's really hard for women to prove Really hard for women to prove Even marital rape is hard for
(1:13:26) women to prove Those are not the things which men are getting tossed into jail for They're getting tossed into jail getting their lives ruined for false
(1:13:32) allegations generally from strangers not from women they're with long term Uh that's just simply not true because al
(1:13:38) abuse allegations are brought up all the time in family court because it's based on preponderous It's It's not You don't
(1:13:45) need evidence So they can just say things I mean I I worked on one case where she threw a rape allegation um
(1:13:51) from the first night they met and then 10 years later she said that he raped her It is the case
(1:13:59) Listen it is the case inside a family court that women will make up all sorts of [ __ ] uh for the for the custody of
(1:14:06) children Nobody's disputing that What I'm talking about specifically is the charges of abuse which generally happens
(1:14:12) So in family court what happens is most women are filing for divorce not under
(1:14:18) an abuse claim but under irreconcilable differences And the amount of them who are reporting abuse in the relationships
(1:14:23) actually is not nearly as high as you're presenting The amount of men who are high status who get their lives
(1:14:28) completely [ __ ] destroyed by false allegations from strange women is extremely high though usually in the
(1:14:35) workplace If they're in any way connected in the workplace uh or if it is the case that they're a high status
(1:14:41) man who goes on a date with a woman that's when you start to see those accusations completely level men I'm not
(1:14:47) saying that doesn't happen in family court It does happen It does happen in family court Correct Yeah Women women
(1:14:54) can throw a And what can he do if he gets a very feminist judge yeah he's going to get [ __ ] Yeah I agree Okay So
(1:15:02) do you think he makes him stupid if he gets [ __ ] like he's automatic no I think I think that the Yeah So but
(1:15:08) what's the prescription what's the prescription would be to begin the process of changing family courts so
(1:15:14) that you don't have the feminist judges that still operate under the uh under the old rules of immediately goes to
(1:15:22) tick tick tick My producer he's got to make a decision this year He's got a what's he going to do this he's going to
(1:15:27) do now is should he should he bet that Andrew Wilson's going to fix the laws for him Should he stay alone for the
(1:15:33) rest of his life because if he ever gets married the woman's for sure going to give him an abuse claim and throw him in prison I didn't say that Is
(1:15:40) that there's I didn't say that I mean that sounds like a terrible prescription Yeah If you listen to me I didn't say
(1:15:46) that But you see the way let's compare it Let's compare the thing Andrew Wilson mitigate all risk possible and then
(1:15:53) Pearl Davis Good luck You're [ __ ] I mean that's the distinction But you see what you're doing is you're making it
(1:15:59) seem like men have two options which is sleep around or be married right that's kind of the I don't know if that's what
(1:16:05) you mean but that's what you're making it seem like But there's a lot of people that are in like two-year relationships
(1:16:11) with a woman There's a lot of people that date casually right they just go on dates They might sleep with one or two
(1:16:17) maybe more than that women And then Sounds like casual sex to me And they Right But then they pick their favorite
(1:16:23) and they get into a relationship and then eventually get married I mean I'm sure and I'm not trying to go personal
(1:16:29) but I'm sure you know most people dated before like they met their previous like partners their wife their right So
(1:16:37) Um and so it's not really one or the other right it's not like degenerates
(1:16:42) and not so when does someone become a degenerate like when does that line like
(1:16:48) when are they beyond the point of return body count when you when you hit this idea of like facious the facious thresh
(1:16:57) when you hit a facious threshold fallacy like when does a thing become the thing right we know that there's degenerates
(1:17:04) can I give you the exact number of dicks a guy has to suck before he's well that would be just one I guess do I have to
(1:17:09) give you the exact number of chicks a dude [ __ ] before he's considered society a degenerate I don't think I
(1:17:15) need to I think that's pretty intuitive we know what degeneracy looks like you don't think so mm- I Okay So a guy Okay
(1:17:22) so here here I'll just I'll just pose it to you if you don't think so I mean there's a lot of guys A guy is in a gang bang He's in a gang bang right with uh
(1:17:30) it's him and three of his friends and they're all [ __ ] one chick Is he a degenerate uh I mean what is he is he doing those
(1:17:37) every week the rest of his life no just he's just he just decided to go in and do it right i personally I don't tell
(1:17:44) men what to do in the bedroom I I think I I prefer the don't ask don't tell Like I just don't You can do what you want
(1:17:52) Yeah Well I mean I prefer not to have STDs floating out in society because people are getting in gang bangs in their maybe their home and the
(1:17:58) libertarian idea of like we're not going to cover but that doesn't affect you How does that affect me how does that affect
(1:18:04) you i live in this society How does you don't have an STD right i have children
(1:18:10) I have cousins I have I have family I have all sorts That's actually what I was trying to get at is conservatives
(1:18:15) want men to save society for their children And that's the point You don't
(1:18:20) ask what's in it for them Wait wait wait wait a second I'm sorry And that's the point You don't you want us to save society for men
(1:18:28) i think people need to make decisions based on the information they have about
(1:18:33) their own life Yeah So I am not I am not I'm going to finish and then you can go I am realistic and I think it's better
(1:18:40) to be prepared than be blindly optimistic So things I would personally
(1:18:46) prepare for your kids are probably going to like um your kids will probably go to
(1:18:52) school with women that do only fans That is probably going to happen Yep And it's better to prepare and have a plan than
(1:18:59) it is than to try to stop it Um I don't think it's effective to stop it Oh well
(1:19:06) I think it is effective to stop Not only that again the framing is incorrect It's not that conservatives are trying
(1:19:12) to conservatives are not trying to save
(1:19:18) uh I mean maybe the TPUSA conservatives are trying to save society for the sake of their children but even if that was
(1:19:23) the case like good That's good But that aside um no what I'm trying to do is
(1:19:29) save men in society men I think men the patriarchy is the most necessary
(1:19:36) component to society's functioning And so if you want to have men who are in a
(1:19:41) patriarchal role who are governing society then you're going to have to prescriptively move men towards that
(1:19:47) That's the only way to do it So ultimately it's like hang on hang on hang on my turn now So ultimately from
(1:19:53) your like social bastardization of this whole thing your framing continuously goes back to well conservative men want
(1:20:00) to save society for their children Yeah And like good But but what does the
(1:20:06) average man get out of that and that's the point they get a society to live in right so I just want to know
(1:20:13) when do you think men live in like bubbles in a forest or do you think that they live in in societies which are
(1:20:19) governed by social relationships okay So when are these changes going to happen like when can Yeah But answer my
(1:20:25) question first Do you think that men live in isolated bubbles or they live in a social dynamic society filled with
(1:20:31) interpersonal relationships well the average man doesn't have many friends He's like three or less I think Yeah But
(1:20:36) they have friends and they have family members and they still have to engage in society You have to go buy a [ __ ] cheeseburger right they got to go buy a
(1:20:42) cheeseburger and not get pickles on it Every stat shows that men are actually checking out a society So yeah That's
(1:20:50) bad though Right That's not good Like we we want to change that Right But I I I
(1:20:55) would say it's pragmatic because they're realizing pragmatism is bad Uh okay Well
(1:21:01) I I hope isn't a strategy And what I I think you're kind of trying to do is sell hope and I think it's better
(1:21:07) pragmatic argument that you're making right now is like guess what no men would ever be in pain ever again if they
(1:21:12) all shot themselves in the head Either would they pearl i don't ultimate form of pragmatism I don't really think
(1:21:17) that's the same But hey you know that No no that's just pragmatism taken to its logical conclusion If you want to stop
(1:21:24) all suffering of men they all go they all go bye-bye They all they're all dead Now there's no more suffering of men That's I said I said men look at the
(1:21:31) facts and make a decision And you can make a decision for yourself I'm here to report the facts And that's the same as
(1:21:37) shoot yourself Okay I mean no that's not No no no You're making a All you all you
(1:21:42) just Wait for the born again virgin guys That's totally That's totally going to get you Nobody made that prescription
(1:21:48) That's way for That's what you said earlier Just lying now It's just reframing Reframing and total [ __ ]
(1:21:53) Never said guys wait for the born again virgin In fact I'm the one wrecking those [ __ ] bras What are you talking
(1:21:58) about the thing I've never made any such prescription It's always reframed Can I edit it here because the thing is edit
(1:22:05) it where I asked you or I can edit it earlier because you did say that you the way you would suggest men dated was to
(1:22:12) wait till marriage even if the woman wasn't a virgin You did say that Yeah that's not has nothing to do with born
(1:22:18) again virgins It's just that's your pragmatism of a social mitigation for bad thing happening That's it It's all a
(1:22:25) matter of mitigation of risk The idea that I said that you need to wait for a born again virgin [ __ ] absurd Never
(1:22:30) said it The reason you have to reframe this is because how should I what should I call them okay I'm advocating Hang on
(1:22:37) Hang on I'm advocating wait for a woman that gave it to other advocating for men's happiness men's rights men's
(1:22:43) health And the only thing you can think of to do is to consistently attempt to reframe it into somehow I'm telling men
(1:22:50) to take some plunge with some [ __ ] skank born again virgin [ __ ] that I'm talking about the mass mitigation of
(1:22:56) risk and the change to a system All right guys I know she slept with your ex-boyfriend Okay Or I know she slept
(1:23:02) with her ex-boyfriend Here comes the straw man that I would never prescribe She Okay Okay Should men wait till
(1:23:08) marriage you said yes right yeah Yeah Generally yes Even if the woman even if the woman isn't a virgin if they if it
(1:23:16) is the case that you want men to do whatever they want then if man really likes the woman don't do whatever you
(1:23:23) want Do what do what Andrew do what Andrew says Do if if it is the case my producer he's taking notes now he's
(1:23:29) going to follow your plan Yeah Yeah So if the man really likes the woman and men should do whatever it is that they
(1:23:36) want right then under then under your feasible system a man should just [ __ ] a
(1:23:42) chick cuz he feels like it right it's like that's untenable One and two yes Is
(1:23:47) it okay for a man to hold his own integrity intact and still be in love with a woman who slept with a man before
(1:23:54) and have good outcomes yes of course it is So now you're shaming men for wanting to sleep with women outside of That's
(1:24:00) what I said You're the one shaming men cuz you're the one saying that they're degenerates if they even though
(1:24:05) statistically outcomes even though statistics outcomes for men who maintain virginity and marry women with low body
(1:24:12) counts or virgins have really good outcomes I am super you know what you'd have to show me the
(1:24:19) study I am super sure that when the woman is not a virgin and the man is
(1:24:24) that is a recipe for disaster I'm it Listen you're right that the risk I know
(1:24:30) I'm right But it's still But it's still mitigated It's still Hang on But it's still mitigated by the fact that if they
(1:24:36) have a lower body count right within the threshold of 1 to three right it does
(1:24:41) mitigate risk significantly Is it always best to have a virgin sure But guess what unfortunately in the world that we
(1:24:48) live in that's probably not what what you're going to get You're probably not going to get a virgin who's a man either
(1:24:53) but you can still mitigate all kinds of risk Like I don't understand Why do you think risk what does he get what does he
(1:24:59) get he gets So one more time I'll explain what men get out of this Even though you keep asking the question I answer it They get what they've always
(1:25:06) such bad answers Like here's a bad deal guys You got a bad
(1:25:11) deal before You're giving a bad deal Not only that here let me ask What have men ever gotten men you've always got one
(1:25:19) thing men have ever gotten Men you've always gotten it bad So you should continue Answer the question Pearl Don't
(1:25:25) dodge Pearl What have men ever gotten men translation Men not answering No notice audience She's not answering
(1:25:32) Audience she's not answering Notice he's not answering either I did answer I answered 15 times Now here's my question
(1:25:37) to you after I gave you the answer What have men ever gotten okay A hundred years ago
(1:25:44) average six to eight children I believe This is off the top of my head So they
(1:25:50) So so you only care about that's caring about children not about men I'm not done I'm not done That's caring about
(1:25:55) children not about men Per He got Well I I I'll finish He got He got a virgin
(1:26:00) wife who had been with nobody else who stayed with him for a lifetime Wait I thought that women's behavior was in was
(1:26:08) ingrained and that they were always [ __ ] men according to you and that the men just didn't know They might have
(1:26:13) they might have been They might have been but it sounds like if they did if women did at the
(1:26:20) time it was not as widely known as it is today If women did they may not have They may I wasn't there I'm not gonna
(1:26:26) speak of I know but you but that's what you said last time You said "No they were still screwing around even then It's just behind the backs and nobody
(1:26:32) knew." Well I mean there's genealogy records that that show that women did
(1:26:38) step out Like there's people that have done like genealogy records and like a lot of times it was the neighbor or
(1:26:43) something like that I'm not going to go back and forth about a hundred years ago because I
(1:26:50) live but that doesn't matter And that's the whole point You keep going you keep going back into you keep going back to a
(1:26:57) hundred years ago I live in the now I don't care what you just asked me this question Andrew I know but you keep but
(1:27:04) you keep deflecting I say this I say here's what you keep but you keep deflecting and bringing up the past
(1:27:09) You're like you're like a woman bringing up the past I'm just making you answer the same question that I'm answering Who cares who cares about 100 years ago
(1:27:16) andrew you're not giving me any answers Here's my answer Give me one Pearl What did they get what did they ever get
(1:27:22) right I don't care about a hundred years ago I care about nothing You've got nothing I care because you're talking
(1:27:27) about the p What do they get today Andrew what do they get they get the same thing they've always gotten which
(1:27:33) is a family The thing that seems to make men the most is happy Unless you can name something else that men were
(1:27:38) getting before that and I'm all ears Do women do women stay today do women stay
(1:27:44) today on average do women stay at less at lesser rates than they used to okay
(1:27:49) By by for sure they do Okay But if you're asking women do women that's a different question you're ask but they
(1:27:57) don't get it They don't get it Yeah A lot of men do get it That's a lie They do get it
(1:28:03) No they don't A lot of men do Yeah I just gave you the stats And by the way if you're talking about again even when
(1:28:09) it comes to guardianship it's quadrupled If you're talking about marriage in a Christian sense 25% divorce low body
(1:28:14) counts even less Are people more people are more people getting married today or less less I'm glad less secularists are
(1:28:22) getting married Good [ __ ] them [ __ ] them I don't care if they get married or not [ __ ] This isn't This isn't a religious
(1:28:28) channel right you're because you're trying to pedal a religious channel You're trying to pedal your trying to pedal your religion right and that's
(1:28:34) kind of trying to pedal outcomes Why do I care if secularist men who are hedonistic want to get married or not
(1:28:40) it's irrelevant The future belongs to those who reproduce And it's not going to be those who don't get married
(1:28:46) because they go "Well the thing is is that I don't feel like I'm getting uh
(1:28:51) anything that I have men haven't always gotten for this." And the one thing you can name same thing I can name They get
(1:28:57) children When I said it you said "Well Andrew that's you Who do the kids for kids who do the kids belong to?" Stop My
(1:29:04) turn Who do the kids yeah Yeah My turn Who do the kids you don't like my turn Yeah You won't even let me answer
(1:29:10) So who do the kids belong to it's just reframing Stop reframing Let me finish Let me finish the point It's a one word
(1:29:16) answer Who do the kids belong to i wasn't done talking interjected with
(1:29:21) your dumb opinion Who do the kids belong to yeah Pearl Hey Pearl One more time Can you answer can you do it can you do
(1:29:27) it yeah Yeah Yeah It goes to the state right now The the children belong to the state Yeah That's terrible That sucks
(1:29:32) But what the children belong to the state before they belong to the king They belong to the king Mhm Yeah You say it's
(1:29:40) a spur because you cut me off every 5 seconds What yeah because you don't have a good answer They don't get anything
(1:29:45) Yeah I g I gave you the same answer you gave me which is hilarious by the way Same answer They don't get a family
(1:29:51) because women divorce Pearl Pearl can you answer my question don't sp What's your question okay What have they ever
(1:29:58) got pearl can you answer my question don't splurging Stop sping I'm just going to answer the
(1:30:05) question Let me let me ask it before he starts sping What have men ever gotten pearl I don't care I don't care about
(1:30:12) history Yeah I don't care Yeah He has to men today have to make decisions off of
(1:30:18) the information today Andrew It doesn't matter what they got It's like what do they get today yeah They get what
(1:30:24) they've always gotten Okay Well if you want to keep convincing men to wait for born again virgins totally fine Mhm I
(1:30:32) hope Except I never Can you Can you Can you ever tell me where I told any man ever to wait for a born again virgin
(1:30:38) okay Why do you keep making that [ __ ] up like why you don't even have to do what
(1:30:44) you want What do you have okay You want men to wait for non-virgin women correct
(1:30:49) no I never said that either I'm talking about the mitigation of You said that twice Mhm You said that twice Yeah And
(1:30:55) here's the thing You can clip it right but I'll counterclipip You won't like what you see because I didn't say that
(1:31:01) I'm talking about the mitigation of risk And when you're talking about the mitigation of risk it still is actually
(1:31:06) less risky Yes Right less risky Does that mean optimal no Do you understand hang on You understand the difference
(1:31:12) between optimal and risk do you understand like risk mitigation versus optimal so you want men to find women
(1:31:19) with below what a three body count Is that what you're suggesting no just less bodies better Okay So what
(1:31:26) what would you say should be the cap i mean yeah Again we're talking about risk
(1:31:32) mitigation You're asking for something which is a specificity right okay So uh
(1:31:37) how many for for instance if I ask this question to you how many uh women are or
(1:31:44) should you ever sleep with a woman who's [ __ ] 100 men should a man ever do that
(1:31:49) could you answer the question yeah Yeah But it this it's actually answering by showing you how facious the actual
(1:31:55) question is Okay So the facious the what you're saying is Andrew give me a threshold I'm not here to give you the
(1:32:00) threshold I'm here to tell you about the mitigation of risk The less bodies the better Yes Does that mean though that if
(1:32:06) you have a high body count woman it can't work out no The risk is way higher How would men verify that
(1:32:13) how would Well here's the thing You asked me this last time It was kind of funny right mhm So they would verify it
(1:32:18) the same way they've always verified it They would look at reputation They would look at past history They would talk
(1:32:25) with friends And you know what's really interesting i went back and I took a look at this and it turns out that when
(1:32:30) men investigate these things and pointantly ask these questions they actually do get a lot of these answers very quickly You can't actually verify
(1:32:37) this based on reputation Okay So if a woman had a past in a different city how
(1:32:42) would the man know especially with social social media
(1:32:49) families big mouth sisters big mouth friends all the other ways that you would always verify If she downloads a dating app how how would how would the
(1:32:57) guy know yeah I know But you can you can endlessly you can endlessly reduce this hypothetical to the point where you can
(1:33:04) just continuously add variables Like what if a woman was in a forest and she her plane went down she was on a desert
(1:33:10) island for three days and the news never broadcast it Could she have slept with a man then yeah But I'm saying that again
(1:33:16) when it comes to risk and mitigation you can do investigation the same way women do with men by the way to find out their
(1:33:22) body count And you can in fact sus out fairly quickly if they have a high one or not Does that mean always no So you
(1:33:29) think about you think most men can figure it out pretty easy How many people she slept with not how many
(1:33:36) precisely but whether or not she slept with more than he's comfortable with or has a reputation of lying about sleeping
(1:33:42) around which would be red flags right okay So you think that's pretty easy So how would So you you just you can just
(1:33:48) ask around and then men will tell them No Well here's the thing about women that's great right they never shut the
(1:33:54) [ __ ] up So the greatest thing about them is they like to narrate their lives and they like to do that especially with their friends And women also like their
(1:34:01) friends like to cause trouble If you start poking around inside of a woman's female circle they start blabbing about
(1:34:07) all kinds of [ __ ] about exes where they've been where they haven't been They do this constantly Okay So I want
(1:34:12) to get back to the because I we never finished the step by step So I'd really like to finish that So you want men to
(1:34:19) wait for the non-virgin women correct no I don't No So you want them to sleep
(1:34:25) together Not my position What's my Tell me what my position is You said that you
(1:34:30) wanted men to wait till marriage I said that would be more optimal Okay For
(1:34:35) men's health to do X thing is not a prescription that they should do X
(1:34:41) things So just because it mitigates risk for you as a man to if you fall in love
(1:34:47) with a woman right for her to have a low body count that still mitigates your risk is not me prescribing that you go
(1:34:53) find a woman who's not a virgin and marry her That's absurd We're talking about the outcomes here the pragmatic
(1:34:59) approach But pra practically what percent of women do you think are marriageable what percent
(1:35:06) that's hard to say I don't know to I mean as a pract as a practical debate
(1:35:11) and you didn't even think about this question at all No I thought about the question but it's a very difficult
(1:35:17) question to notate how many exactly like how many women have red hair i don't
(1:35:22) know How many women you know have red eye i don't know the actual answer to this interview but I still think I still
(1:35:28) think that somewhere around uh at least 20 25% of eligible marriageable women
(1:35:35) within the the the element of marriageable men is a good distinct possibility they work out because that's
(1:35:41) what the stats show me that almost almost 60% of these marriages actually do work out okay long term if they're
(1:35:48) under the right conditionals Well if they're religious right no no no that significantly increases it from 60% Okay
(1:35:55) Okay So you want men to find these 20 So the majority of women are not going to work right so you're saying to men you
(1:36:03) get you might find out of one out of four women you might get a wife No no I was
(1:36:09) talking about the totality of the population But if you insert risk mitigation for marriageable women right
(1:36:16) then your your odds actually drastically increase Yeah Yeah You think one out of four women have a body count under 10 no
(1:36:23) I didn't say that either But you said marriage But I mean think you think men should accept Do you think men should
(1:36:29) accept more than 10 well here let's just think men should accept more than five Well how many women have less than body
(1:36:35) yeah but I don't I don't trust stats that women report their body Okay So now So now So now whatever the data says
(1:36:41) it's wrong too I mean if women say it Yeah Come on If it's asking women about
(1:36:47) body count come on Andrew You got to like be realistic here Yeah it it looks like it's somewhere the
(1:36:54) average of it is about 50% of women by the time they're marriageable age have less than a five body count Yes that's
(1:37:00) what I'm looking at But you have been out of the dating market too long Andrew This is the stats I'm looking at
(1:37:07) All right guys Yeah And now we're looking at marriageable age which is going to be between Okay Uh the age of
(1:37:14) 19 and 29 right so we're looking at marriageable age for children Now is that the case i don't know if that's the
(1:37:20) case But ultimately who cares ultimately anyway the truth of the matter is even
(1:37:25) if it's damaged who cares about bodies that's not what I said Who cares anyway about the topic at no topic at hand the
(1:37:33) case of the matter is that even if none of them right now were marriageable and they were all [ __ ] skanks and they
(1:37:38) all had dozens of bodies we would still be trying to move society towards a reform of such a system and not try to
(1:37:45) black pill and nihilism all uh that would be stupid ultimately when we look
(1:37:50) at males men's happiness They want to get married I want Okay Okay fine I want to get back to the step by step You're
(1:37:58) happily married Let's let's let's get to the step by step or what we're we're
(1:38:04) getting stuck at the the waiting So what's after that so then you marry her I don't understand
(1:38:10) what what is the question you're asking me if you're giving a prescription I
(1:38:15) want a detailed how to do it So Oh well what you do is you get a club and you
(1:38:20) walk over to a chick and you bash her in the [ __ ] head and you take her back to your house and you bang her right
(1:38:26) that's a detailed step-by-step plan Or did you maybe want to talk about viable prescriptions rather than Andrew gives
(1:38:33) dating advice which has nothing at all to do with the conversation of moving men towards marriage ability yeah but
(1:38:39) you Okay so if you want men to get married you can't tell them how to get there Really
(1:38:45) that's that's [ __ ] stupid What are you talking why would why would I need to be a determining factor for every
(1:38:51) individual man on earth for a step-by-step guide of how they get married that's [ __ ] [ __ ] Okay
(1:38:57) Well like that's literally [ __ ] Why would you My producers on the market 40-year-old guy in the Midwest What
(1:39:03) should he do there you go Lose weight Okay then what i would start with that No I'm kidding Mr Look I took a chief
(1:39:09) shot because it was funny I like the guy I like the guy I thought it was funny I thought it was funny You met him Yeah
(1:39:14) Yeah I it was a look he's he's skinnier than me I'm just joking with the guy I was kidding Okay fine Totally fine Just
(1:39:21) a gem That's I don't know I don't know what the intricacies of his life are Every every single individual is going to have a completely different He should
(1:39:27) make he should make the decision and not you right no No Based on where people are in the distinctions of their life
(1:39:34) Well yeah I mean ultimately everyone's going to make their own decision but but hang on Stop I'm going to answer your [ __ ] question Mhm Each individual
(1:39:41) person on planet Earth is going to have a unique set of circumstances which because I'm not an omnipotent god nor
(1:39:49) psychic have no ability at all to understand in a comprehensive way But I
(1:39:54) can still even though I know that that I'm not going to be able to tell how everybody on the road drives I can still
(1:40:00) tell you that a stop sign [ __ ] works Right so if if that's true why do you talk like one like what like you talk
(1:40:07) like you're the god that knows like the best way for people to live I've never done that one In fact I just told you that I would not sit here I mean you
(1:40:14) call you call people degenerates that you call people degenerates if they don't live exactly how you live No I'm
(1:40:20) not asking them to live exactly how I live That's ridiculous Mhm Yeah I mean I
(1:40:26) mean Yes If you're if you're a homosexuality I just think people are tired of getting preached at Andrew Yeah I mean I think
(1:40:32) that people are tired of you enabling the degeneracy of homosexuality cuz you won't give a prescription right like
(1:40:38) what power do I have to stop them you have the power of the vote the power of influence And not only that here's the
(1:40:44) other thing that's so funny about this right it's like what power do I have asking for when you ask for hang on real
(1:40:49) quick before we get to that When you ask for these like detailed give me a step-by-step guide Pearl you have a job
(1:40:55) You're a podcaster right give me a step-by-step guide for how everybody on planet Earth gets to work as a podcaster
(1:41:02) No just as anything Well I I don't know how to do anything I know how to do be
(1:41:08) do podcasting No no just how do people how does every person on planet Earth get to work every one of them as a pod I
(1:41:15) could tell you how to just ever anywhere in any circumstance That's really the
(1:41:21) same but okay It's the same You're asking me to write a prescription for every single individualistic circumstance on earth for every man
(1:41:27) That's insane Well I know but I I gave you like what more information you could ask more questions and I could give you specific answers I don't even have to
(1:41:33) use my producer I mean why would I if I was I know but if I was if I was going
(1:41:39) to give a quote like if I was going to do the podcasting one like I would have a set of questions that I could easily
(1:41:44) give you a stepbystep Oh so you can't tell bas you can't just tell based on general circumstance but you need to
(1:41:50) have individual experiences So ask me ask me a few questions and then I can give you Exactly That's my whole point
(1:41:57) So when you ask me for a prescription for every man on earth individually ask each of them a
(1:42:03) bunch of questions I didn't say every man on earth but we can do a hypothetical guy Then why don't why
(1:42:09) don't we do a hypothetical it should be easy Give me ask me a few questions Yeah Yeah Yeah So here's the thing I'm not
(1:42:15) I'm not okay So I'm trying to answer You're not I'm not a dating coach I've never said that I was a dating coach But
(1:42:20) the thing is I don't build highways either but I sure know when the highways [ __ ] up Pearl Okay So you don't have
(1:42:28) No I I've answered every single question You don't understand how facious the even even the arguments you're making
(1:42:34) are but how absurd the questions become when it's absurd for me to if you're giving a prescription which I'm not but
(1:42:40) you are It's absurd for me to ask questions of how to get there No you can ask whatever question you want but just
(1:42:45) understand that when I equate it to you're trying to get get me to give a prescription for every man on earth which I stated multiple times and you're
(1:42:51) then you change it to well this one individual man based on his unique set of circumstances It's going to change
(1:42:57) and vary from person to person to person to person It's like asking me what kind of car should a man drive based on his
(1:43:02) unique set of circumstance I don't [ __ ] know Did you I mean okay so did you meet my like dad when you were here
(1:43:08) did you meet him i don't know if you I don't know I don't So my dad he's worked in he okay you might have maybe didn't
(1:43:14) he's worked in software for like 30 years He's a really pragmatic guy right yeah And the equivalent of what you're
(1:43:20) saying is like if you had an opinion on his software breaking I mean it's cool
(1:43:26) and then you say oh well this is what you should do with the software And he would say okay well how do I do it and
(1:43:31) then you say well I can't give you an answer you know And then like he would just think you're an idiot Oh really
(1:43:38) it's the same like if the person was on YouTube and was like "Hey I know I know
(1:43:44) I know I know what you're gonna like Yeah I know what you're gonna You're going to try to equate it." Um so and
(1:43:50) that's kind of what you're doing You're saying that YouTube should have a live stream Oh yeah Do you know how to put one in no Well then you shouldn't tell
(1:43:57) them that they should have a live chat just I just in my my opinion and I'll just I'll just my opinion is you've just
(1:44:02) kind of been out of the dating game too long and I I think you would get eaten alive Like I think if you believe that
(1:44:09) half of women have three bodies I I don't know how you believe that for doing like whatever I said I know but
(1:44:15) you're literally not what I said Why do you fine fine fine the body count stats
(1:44:21) that you cited would be so ridiculous to any guy actually they may be listen they
(1:44:26) may be literally said just based on what I personally I know I know I know but I
(1:44:31) don't even know how you believe them with like being on whatever all the time I didn't say I believed them okay like
(1:44:37) I've never said any of this I don't know if the best approach is gonna I don't
(1:44:44) know if your prescription is working in the modern world I think it's going to
(1:44:49) leave a lot of guys frustrated Do you Pearl do you have any prescription um however I do Do you have any
(1:44:55) prescription at all as I've said I don't tell men how to live No you have none You can't How do you criticize anybody
(1:45:01) for anything you have nothing to give off I Well what I do is I do report on
(1:45:06) the facts and the trends and where I see things going I'm in the business of prediction Yeah that's fine to be a newscaster You keep I I That's what I do
(1:45:14) right so I do that but then how can you criticize anybody's I do the call-in
(1:45:19) shows Um well I don't criticize if you say this is a way you can do it or you
(1:45:24) could do it that way You mean all the things that I just said for risk but when you're but when you're saying if you don't live how I live you're a
(1:45:31) degenerate and you and you that's what you insinuate Um you can keep saying I
(1:45:36) will specifically say like homosexuality is degenerate Yes Absolutely But if a guy chooses to live life on his own
(1:45:44) terms and not your terms you insinuate that there's something wrong with them If they Yeah If a man decides to live a
(1:45:49) life of promiscuity and drugs I think he's degenerate Yes that's correct Yes Right But I mean this is all kind of
(1:45:54) like I mean come on Were you a virgin on your wedding day like come on Never said I was I was also I was also deeply
(1:46:02) steeped myself in the degeneracy of promiscuity But so the way it comes across to a lot
(1:46:08) of people is I had my fun but you can't and that's how that's how it that's how
(1:46:14) it's going to come off to people And I like so therefore and I am somehow and I
(1:46:19) am somehow morally superior because you've ever done anything wrong So I also smoke and tell my kids not to smoke
(1:46:25) What a scumbag I just I can't believe why would I do that why would I totally fine with your kids i also tell my kids
(1:46:30) not to I would also tell your kids not to smoke Totally fine with tell your kids not to smoke These are these are
(1:46:36) adult men Like they don't need to be nagged right you're like turning into a woman where you're nagging them Nobody's
(1:46:41) nag the only one who's nagging them is you because you're trying to knock down every single societal prescriptor
(1:46:46) possible to help them That's not what I said I said if men want to try if men
(1:46:52) want to try your way I have no problem with that You can try it I don't think
(1:46:58) it's pragmatic in the modern world based on what I've seen But who am I to tell a
(1:47:03) guy how to date what is pragmatic in the modern world can you tell me that i think it's tough Um I That's not a
(1:47:10) [ __ ] answer It's not pragmatic Well what's pragmatic i don't know Well I think that I think most men can come up
(1:47:15) with their own solutions better than me a YouTuber Then how can you make a claim that anything I say is not pragmatic
(1:47:21) when I say "Well then what is pragmatic?" And you say "I don't know." I wouldn't predict that it would work I
(1:47:27) could give my opinion right okay I am but what I'm not going to do is I'm not going to label adult men as
(1:47:34) degenerate if they don't live according to my personal what is the most pragmatic thing men can do what is I I
(1:47:39) think the most pragmatic thing that men can do is look at the facts and make a decision based on the information he has
(1:47:46) about his own life I think if but I don't think I don't you mean exactly
(1:47:51) what I have been saying the entire time no but you say that you have the answers and I don't think you do because I think
(1:47:57) I didn't what answers did I say I I think that the prescription you gave of a step by step of how to get to marriage
(1:48:03) would not work in the modern day What prescriptions did I give for that um you gave a prescription on waiting for a
(1:48:11) woman that does not wait No no I didn't give that as a prescription I only gave it as a contrast of outcome for men who
(1:48:20) go and hook up with those women and don't get married having worse outcomes That is not a prescription that you
(1:48:26) should do the thing Pearl for the 30th time Okay Well it's just both things bad
(1:48:31) one thing worse So but the way you're talking it's like you're the ultimate morality police of
(1:48:37) what's good and bad Right Give me a single moral prescription that I've given a single one And well you
(1:48:42) insinuated that men are degenerates for what they do in their sex lives Like I don't think Donald Trump's a degenerate
(1:48:48) even though he's been married three times I think he was a degenerate I think I don't think so I think he made
(1:48:54) them Yeah I don't think so So so then I just want to make sure I got this right Any sexual behavior men engage with you
(1:49:01) don't believe is degenerate um I think men are responding to the rules that women made Can Yeah Yes or no
(1:49:08) would be great Yes or no would be great I I I gave you an answer I men are yes
(1:49:13) or no Is there anything men can do sexually with people that you find degenerate men are they [ __ ] a dog If
(1:49:21) they [ __ ] a dog are they degenerate men are responding to the rules that women made So So I I If a man [ __ ] a dog can
(1:49:29) we call him degenerate that's just gross Okay Can we call it Can we at least say that's degenerate
(1:49:36) um I mean I would just say it's disgusting Like that's nasty But not degenerate You're still not willing to
(1:49:42) call that degenerate i mean if you want to like be the more if a man grabs another man and [ __ ] a hairy ass if you
(1:49:49) want to essentially like act as a preacher it's totally fine And I just think people are tired What's the preaching there's no preaching I just
(1:49:55) asked you a question I've never preached on this channel ever I'm still not preaching I'm just offering real world
(1:50:00) solutions under the same very idea I'm totally So my question my question
(1:50:06) totally can you at least say that a man who [ __ ] a dog is a degenerate
(1:50:11) um that's disgusting I'll call that a degenerate Fine Okay [ __ ] finally you
(1:50:16) call that But a man who [ __ ] another man up his hairy [ __ ] is not Um I
(1:50:21) mean I just don't care if he does that or is that a degenerate or not i mean that's gross But you don't know You
(1:50:27) don't know if that's degenerate I'm just not here I'm not here to tell men what to do in their sex lives I think people
(1:50:33) are tired of getting policed And like men from the time they really [ __ ] dogs are tired of getting men That's not what
(1:50:40) I'm saying Like men from a young age are shamed for their sexuality They're shame from a super young age They're told
(1:50:47) they're they're not like they're wrong for watching porn They're told they're wrong for wanting to have sex with women
(1:50:52) They're told they're wrong for approaching I don't think we need another person telling them they're wrong This is great
(1:50:58) So they're wrong All the things you think Stop interrupting me Stop Yeah
(1:51:04) Yeah All the things you think have bad outcomes for men we should still promote Andrew like I'm trying to be I'm trying to be nice but like you're on my show
(1:51:10) Can you stop interrupting me please yeah You interrupt as much as I do if not more Okay I I don't think that's true but it's okay And by the way who's on
(1:51:17) whose show right now really you're you are a very big YouTuber Okay You're very big You're very famous Okay So um but I
(1:51:25) just think men from a young age have been shamed for their sexuality I don't think they really need someone else
(1:51:31) doing it And it just comes off as like a holier than thou when you're constantly calling them degenerates for responding
(1:51:37) to the environment that women made I don't think it's pragmatic for most men
(1:51:42) to wait until they're 30 to have sex I don't think that and most women don't
(1:51:47) select most men until they're in their late 20s early 30s Go ahead So let me get this right just to make sure that I
(1:51:53) have this correct Uh I don't me Pearl Davis don't want to govern the behavior of men How dare you call men who engage
(1:51:59) in sexual promiscuity degenerates Even though that would be you know you governing the behavior of me man Right
(1:52:05) Pure hypocrisy on display Yes Well I can't control it I'm I can't control
(1:52:10) anything they do Yeah But somehow you can give a prescription that I shouldn't be doing that I can't give a prescription for what other people You
(1:52:16) can You totally can You totally can But it's just it But you're just saying people are tired of it They're tired of
(1:52:22) men saying this is really bad for men to do for their own health I would say that men are pretty tired of being nagged for
(1:52:30) their sexuality in general Oh Oh Well I mean that's terrible that
(1:52:35) men get get told that they're not allowed to have anal sex with other men because they're degenerates That's just
(1:52:40) terrible bro Somehow I think that men though by and large are going to agree with me on this that degenerate behavior
(1:52:46) and honorifics in men is something which men generally tend to steer clear of
(1:52:51) especially unhonor cultures which is the culture that we come from Yeah I don't
(1:52:57) think that that has anything to do with religion at all I just I don't think what you're selling is a good sell So
(1:53:03) Okay Well I mean I'm selling something at least right you're not selling anything Just a script like a news
(1:53:08) broadcast like the Red Pill news broadcast I do I do the news you know it's fine But yeah I don't I don't think
(1:53:14) men are going to really watch this and think this is a great thing I'm getting a ton out of this because I just there's
(1:53:21) no selling point You get a a exho That's like pretty much what you're saying Or maybe a girl that's [ __ ] two other
(1:53:28) dudes Literally not saying any of that In fact the opposite In fact I'm trying to initiate inside any sort of reform so
(1:53:34) that we can get away from that But the second I do you call it you say "How dare you preach about degeneracy?" And
(1:53:40) it's like "Well wait You can't have high body counts if they're not [ __ ] them Pearl." And they can't have high body counts if they're not [ __ ] one thing
(1:53:46) called social shame which leads to degeneracy Is that I don't think anything you're saying is very realistic
(1:53:52) I think it like kind of sounds like you just switch between these two arguments Is it that I call it degenerates or that you think it's not realistic well I
(1:53:58) think there Yeah I think there's two parts to it The one is that you're shaming men for their behavior and their
(1:54:04) sexuality And two is that I think that
(1:54:09) um none of the changes that you're talking about really are realistic anytime soon And so men have to make
(1:54:16) decisions on marriage today And unfortunately the value prop you're
(1:54:21) saying just isn't great because at the end of because at the end of the day men's kids don't belong to them Women
(1:54:27) have more power in the media in the state and um in society in general And
(1:54:33) so I don't really see this that men rushing to sign up to get married Great So tell me again what's the most
(1:54:39) pragmatic thing men can do right now then um it depends on the guy I can't speak
(1:54:47) as about men as a collective I can't Okay The most prag it the most pragmatic
(1:54:52) thing that men can do I don't know Depends on the guy Andrew walk me through dating Well I don't know It
(1:54:57) depends on the guy Giving a prescription but it's okay Not only that I do I do
(1:55:02) have I do I do have another guest coming so I do have to go Yeah Yeah But I got one last thing just real quick Okay To
(1:55:08) to summarize this I got my I'm listening I'm just sending Yeah My interest is in men's health and men's welfare and
(1:55:15) women's in men's well-being Ultimately I've given nothing but great prescriptions towards that You've given
(1:55:21) nothing towards that Instead you just offer epistemic nihilism over and over and over again and he can't actually
(1:55:27) refute any of the points without telling me what I should be doing It's like a performative contradiction on his face
(1:55:32) Okay now listen Here's the thing that's funny about this I won't go on a monologue for a closer here I did enjoy
(1:55:38) the conversation ultimately and I know as heated as this got I want my entire chat to know and yours too I don't have
(1:55:44) any problems with Hannah Never will I don't have any problems with Pearl Davis All right I've always respected the work
(1:55:50) that she does But sometimes this kind of like in-house slugfest is necessary and
(1:55:55) good for all sides And I still consider her to be a friend I know that this was a very heated debate ultimately but I
(1:56:02) don't have any bad blood towards you I just want to let you know that I have a lot of bad blood towards you I'm never talking to you again That's fair I'm
(1:56:09) just kidding That's fair Anyway hold on I think that this sort of thing is good ultimately Yeah Um have
(1:56:16) you debated like um who have you debated in the red pill space i I don't know A lot of them I was just
(1:56:23) curious Okay Well thanks for coming on We have Amoris Husbands on next Do you know who that is oh yeah Oh that's going
(1:56:31) to be wild I'll do a I'll do a raid over to your channel too Okay Cuz that's going to be a [ __ ] wild one But look
(1:56:36) really there's no bad blood I know that my job is to debate my worldview the best I possibly can Sometimes that has
(1:56:42) created conflict with people like you who are friends of mine in the past I definitely don't want that And I am very
(1:56:48) much a supporter of the types of work that you do with the descriptors that you put out I think that they're golden
(1:56:54) many of them I've used many of those stats myself So there's no bad blood here Never think for a second there is
(1:56:59) Okay All right Thanks for coming Yep Do you know what the funny thing is i
(1:57:04) always am hesitant to use your first name because I forget yours is public Yeah No cuz so many people in this space
(1:57:11) are like not public So I always have to like think about it first But I'm like "Wait no I can I don't have to call you
(1:57:17) the crucible." Thanks for coming Andrew All right Thank you Pearl Have a good day Okay bye All right guys So next we
(1:57:25) got Amorith and then I'm going to read super chats Um okay we got over a thousand
(1:57:34) people Do you want actually Doug MPA can you send him the link Yeah because I want to see if he has any thoughts on
(1:57:39) the conversation Actually it would have been interesting I should have brought both of them up I feel like Doug MPA
(1:57:44) would have loved this Um okay
(1:57:50) So let's do supers All right Andrew is completely
(1:57:57) out of line Most things he says are usually on point but his homophobia is on full display at this
(1:58:02) time Look at I'm kind of homophobic too I just like I just don't care Um Andrew
(1:58:08) stepdad are men that women wouldn't date if they have kids Andrew Andrew's a stepdad Pearl your value pragmatism and
(1:58:14) happiness above any other outcome Zero moral ground the same as your liberal and feminist followers Um Pearl sounding
(1:58:20) like a modern 304 I guess So Pearl versus Pale Man from Pan's Labyrinth Um
(1:58:26) I'm Oh my gosh Peter I made love to my first wife She passed away I married again and made love to her What does
(1:58:33) that make me a degenerate obviously Yes we And this is my point They pedal religion So
(1:58:40) um like I you just every time someone's trying to sell you something they're
(1:58:46) always going to like push things like towards their worldview And that's the problem Yes we are pedaling religion If
(1:58:52) you don't believe in any higher purpose then there's no reason to get married or have a family or do anything except part
(1:58:57) Yeah And that I think that's the other point Most people aren't that religious Marriage is a sacrament of the church
(1:59:02) and not a piece of paper Also I forgot he met you So I'm sorry you got dragged into this I forgot he met you in
(1:59:11) person You were this like fantasy like guy I was like "No don't roast my
(1:59:17) producer Don't do that He's innocent in this." Um history
(1:59:23) they got a real possibility of family Um democracy's design has been failings We've reached it You can't stop what
(1:59:30) people believe in good or bad Collapse is likely the only option left You guys are talking past each other Andrew cares
(1:59:37) about higher meaning and purpose in his worldview One of the Christian ethics Pearl Pearl is stickly strictly sticking
(1:59:43) to the material in here and now Um the parasocial weirdo Gen X fans only
(1:59:51) subscribers are mad Their daddies they live vicariously through getting wrecked Get a
(1:59:57) surrogate Men's reward is further out of reach than in history This is the point
(2:00:02) The nonset if the product is good people will buy um will line up is historically and evidently not true at all It's
(2:00:09) called getting a surrogate destroys his argument Kids raised by a single father do just as well as a two parent household don't need real marriage Um
(2:00:16) ask if things have gotten worse Oh I should have asked that Good question He can't acknowledge it's gotten worse What
(2:00:22) men um get in family and children in a lifetime commitment Being a father and
(2:00:27) raising children with a mother is its own reward It fails at a base Um either
(2:00:33) women either ignore NIST or deny it exists Um women could fix all of this if they wanted to They created the system
(2:00:40) They have votes Men didn't break the social contract Women did And since they're so smart why don't they fix this
(2:00:45) um urban families are non-existent People don't communicate anymore just looking for that money Yes men get what
(2:00:53) they always got for marriage and kids but the risks and costs for the gambler way up a thousand times in the past
(2:00:58) years Andrew you're arguing against the rational analysis of billions of men Men get a family uh which gets destroyed
(2:01:05) It's easy to make silly oaf girls look bad but when Andrew is over his head dealing with Pearl men garnered
(2:01:10) authority and respect from their wives That was their benefit Um egalitarians will never allow male authority The
(2:01:16) allure in history of the possibility of getting a family was much higher and reasonable He can't acknowledge it's getting worse from
(2:01:23) history Oh my gosh there's so many Um shut up everyone I really enjoyed
(2:01:30) seeing Andrew on Louder with Crowder For me personally seeing Andrew getting on bigger outlets I'm predicting eventually
(2:01:35) a um collision course with Andrew and Matt Walsh Prescription isn't the
(2:01:40) problem Getting there is OMG from the cade The dube reminds me of an apocalypse giving the gospel I'm going to have to change my day off evening
(2:01:46) plans now Women's influential control politics aka government and companies for advertisement They have the power
(2:01:52) over propaganda and try convincing power to give up power Great prescription but you can't make it Um look at the support
(2:02:00) we Oh wait I read this one Okay let me refresh and then Doug MPA can give his
(2:02:05) points [Music]
(2:02:11) Um okay Doug MPA how you doing hey bro
(2:02:18) how are you doing i'm good What's going on um so I like Andrew Wilson I'll
(2:02:27) always be team Pearl because I've been supporting you since before you got famous Um my biggest thing with Andrew
(2:02:36) is he keeps doing the whole men owe
(2:02:42) society And one of the best quotes I've ever heard is women changed the social rules
(2:02:49) to the 20th century in in the 20 in the 20th century in the 21st century is going to be men responding to it and men
(2:02:56) like Andrew does not they do not men like Andrew don't like how men are responding to the how women rewrote
(2:03:03) society and he makes a false dichotomy between you're either virtuous and you're a man in a marriage or you're
(2:03:10) banging a bunch of [ __ ] and that's not true The red pill never says just bang a bunch of [ __ ] Guys you don't have to
(2:03:16) be a pack mule for some woman You You just don't And men don't get anything
(2:03:22) out of the average man doesn't get anything out of marriage I'm sorry And also with religious prescriptions we all
(2:03:30) know that religious women can be as big of [ __ ] if not bigger [ __ ] than secular women There is a social
(2:03:37) infrastructure in place to reward women being um uh not having virtue and not
(2:03:44) being virtuous So Andrew says look for virtuous women Okay What incentive do
(2:03:51) women have okay For a woman to be virtuous she has to act in a virtuous
(2:03:57) way Right like Christians you have to choose
(2:04:03) to be a Christian You labor yourself You label yourself as one and you choose to live that lifestyle If a woman is to be
(2:04:08) virtuous she has to to exist in a virtuous way In modern society women
(2:04:15) aren't virtuous and they are celebrated for not being virtuous So there's no point in men
(2:04:22) getting married They don't get anything Women will divorce you They'll take your kids And here's the thing the only thing
(2:04:29) worse than being lonely and men being lonest and being unhappy is getting your family ripped away from you paying
(2:04:35) alimony and child support while your wife bangs her personal trainer on your
(2:04:40) dime In the red pill the worst thing that could happen is usually
(2:04:46) that So I'd rather be lonely by myself than be a guy that bought that bought a
(2:04:53) bad deal and now his wife gets the benefit his ex-wife gets the benefit for the rest of his life while he's in
(2:05:00) poverty And so I like the fact that Andrew is so hopeful and so
(2:05:05) optimistic But you got to live now guys Your
(2:05:10) emotional mental spiritual and monetary health is at stake And no one is going
(2:05:17) to care about you unless you care about yourself And here's the thing What a lot
(2:05:22) of these TRCcons don't realize is that us red pill people we can say don't get married all you want don't get kid don't
(2:05:30) have kids all you want but men are going to keep doing men are going to keep making decisions cuz that's what men do
(2:05:36) We're costbenefit calculators We make decisions The red pill is just about awareness We want men to make the best
(2:05:42) decision possible because no matter the decision whatever the outcome is it's your fault You have to take
(2:05:49) responsibility for it And there's been 40 50 years of unadulterated unfiltered
(2:05:55) unchallenged misandry in this country And also one last thing anything
(2:06:02) that's taken for granted take it away take it away from the person and see what
(2:06:07) happens That's what men are doing right now Men have been taken for granted for the past 50 years
(2:06:14) Men have been women's little you know little golden shiny toy that they've
(2:06:21) been you know tossing around and and kicking around and and throwing in the
(2:06:26) mud and stuff They've been taking this shiny little toy for for granted And men are saying "If you think you're so
(2:06:32) strong independent go right ahead and see what happens." And so I'm all for men
(2:06:39) unplugging minding your own business don't get married don't have kids Men
(2:06:46) most of the people alone throughout history have been men Now we can see what happens when
(2:06:53) it's women Women think they want the smoke of being a man but they don't know
(2:06:59) what that entails Being a man is a long hard road It's not fun But it's also the
(2:07:06) greatest responsibility and the greatest gift that you could possibly have is the
(2:07:12) journey of a man Women think they want to smoke So let them find
(2:07:17) out Live life on your own terms As long as you're not be a terrible person
(2:07:23) you're not harming others So I just don't like what especially with religious people I'm not
(2:07:29) religious but these religious prescripttors Pearl tries to make her um
(2:07:36) her content for relatable to all men not just Christians Muslims or whatever
(2:07:42) because all men can get God All of them can
(2:07:48) So Pearl is trying to appeal to as many men as possible And so anyway so I just I like
(2:07:57) Andrew He's my favorite um debater right now I like watching him cook these hoes
(2:08:04) but when it comes to modern dating and what men have to go through it it's
(2:08:10) rough out here man It's rough out here Um I'm going to read on from the website
(2:08:15) If you guys have anything on the website you do get unlimited super chats on the audacitywork.com The link is in the
(2:08:21) description We are on both app stores It was a good heated debate It got very heated but I enjoyed it I think you
(2:08:26) should continue this with him but maybe have Rachel on at the same time Okay Yeah probably We could do it again
(2:08:35) Um okay The I didn't see Andrew was talking about What do you think about
(2:08:41) the argument Doug that he was saying how like it's best for men to get married and he just want he just does what's
(2:08:47) best for men so you the biggest I don't have any children right
(2:08:53) and like my parents say "Oh why don't you have any children?" I say "Because I'd have to have a children I'd have to
(2:08:58) have a child with one of these modern women." Modern women have no duty to
(2:09:05) anything They What is more important to women and what can get women to care
(2:09:11) more about anything except their own selfish desires
(2:09:18) what what nothing How can you I think that men in their DNA still have um they
(2:09:26) still strive for what's best for society God country family but women don't have
(2:09:33) that same responsibility and that same duty You always say on your channel Pearl there's people have this misnomer
(2:09:39) and this make the mistake that women are the more nurturing gender and in 2025 that they're not They're simply not Men
(2:09:45) are more nurturing than women Tell me I'm lying No women put and I think that
(2:09:51) the one of the main uh motivations and tactics of modern women is they want to
(2:09:57) take a successful ambitious god-fearing man and when they get married have that
(2:10:03) man set aside his ambition his desires for her selfish desires A woman could
(2:10:10) can have a husband have a family and still be thinking about herself The man
(2:10:15) is planning for the wife and the children and the woman is planning for herself Nothing in 2025 is more
(2:10:23) important to women than their own selfish desires And that's what guys
(2:10:28) like Andrew don't put into the equation You're giving prescriptions for
(2:10:34) men but they still have to deal with these women Yeah I just would never like if someone took his prescription and
(2:10:40) ended up committing suicide would he feel responsible well I mean and that's and I'm not trying to like be a doom and
(2:10:46) gloomer but it's like I would feel responsible if someone took my advice and they went like that's why you know
(2:10:53) you have to make the decision because the responsibility for it's on you It's not on me Like I don't have to deal with
(2:10:58) it's easy for an influencer to say what you should do with your life And like why did he keep saying that I didn't
(2:11:04) that he didn't say to wait for a non-virgin woman like did I miss something he did say that did he not
(2:11:10) well I mean there needs to be another term besides a bornagain Oh he just
(2:11:16) didn't like the term I'm like what what else are you going to call it like it's like a woman that's not a virgin getting
(2:11:22) virgin benefits Like what else are you guys and to people that are from Andrew's channel on here
(2:11:30) um you want to be the guy that the woman sleeps with on the first date You do Cuz most night I'd say 90% of women have
(2:11:37) slept with a guy on the first date You want to be that guy You don't want to be the guy that she makes weight
(2:11:43) because then I mean come on now But all right So that that channels
(2:11:48) in then you become this guy All right Have you seen the Amorith beef yet
